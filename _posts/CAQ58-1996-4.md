## LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### Pepper Madness
Thanks for raising questions about the use and abuse of pepper spray in your spring issue. Lynne Wilson's article prompted me to look into pepper spray-related deaths in Canada. While my search covered only the last two years and just the four most populous provinces, I turned up five deaths that followed police use of the spray. Even if there are no other cases, that means Canada is, on a per capita basis, "keeping up with the Joneses" — our neighbours to the south. One fact that turned up is that of the five dead in Canada, three were schizophrenic.

It would be fascinating to see if, using the larger sample of deaths in the US, that statistic holds as the number grows. And if so — why? That three mentally ill people have died here is an unspeakable tragedy in the midst of an unexamined abuse. Keep up the good work.

### Population: Myth or Menace
In her article "Lie: Overpopulation is the Main Cause of Poverty, Environmental Degradation, and Instability" Hartmann presented no evidence to support her premise that overpopulation is a myth, yet went on to tell what the consequences of that myth are. Many of my numbers come from Lester Brown, Full House, W.W. Norton & Co., 1994.

1) Demographic alarmism. What Hartmann calls long-term trends toward stabilization are predicted to stabilize at over twice the present world population. That is, in the next 40 years Nigeria's population will grow by 190 million, Ethiopia's by 106 million, India's by 590 million, and China's by 490 million (i.e., 1.376 billion in these four countries alone). To suggest that these, and the many other growing countries, can handle this extra population is ludicrous. Also, Hardin's Living Within Limits shows that it is also a myth that birth rates decline with access to health, education, and employment. Besides, populations grow first, then stabilize, when health improves. Saying, as Hartmann does, that birth rates are declining in "virtually every region of the world" ignores a minor detail. Many small regions and few large ones exist, and large ones are growing (China, India, for example)!

2) Smokescreen that obscures unequal power relations. Here Hartmann hits the nail on the head. The average number of people per square mile in affluent Europe, Japan, and the US is 480, compared to 92 per square mile in all of Central and South America. Yet, clearly the affluent countries with the power are also the most populous (in this case, 706 million in 10 affluent vs. 428 million in 20 poor countries). I do not include Asian countries (besides Japan) because of length limitations, but for example, Kampuchea has 146 people per square mile while Israel has 632! Clearly the power lies in the hands of very populated countries. So we cannot blame the poor countries of the world for their putative population problems.

3) It masks the real cause of environmental degradation. No, given that the most influential (and therefore most consuming) countries are also very densely populated, they are also the cause of the environmental degradation, but it is still very much a population problem! If there were not so danged many wealthy people, the world would be in much better shape!

4) It serves as a tool of disinformation in national security circles. No doubt! After all, how many people know point #2 above? We are deceived into blaming population growth in Mexico (122 per square mile) or Brazil (48 per sq. mi., the US has 69) while ignoring the population of Japan (857), the Netherlands (958), of Great Britain (617), and even of Italy (499). Who has the population problem?

5) It reinforces the politics of scapegoating in the US. What else is new? If we knew the ranking of US population density, then perhaps we would hesitate to lay the blame. Finally, think of the number of people as a rough indicator of the amount of available money. When the population grows, there is more money. Them that's got shall have. Thus, CEOs make more in a day than the average US worker makes in a year, and these workers make more in a week than those in poorer countries do in a year. Also, a large wealthy population requires a much larger resource base. Thus, Third World countries are the resource base, as is the earth. The world cannot indefinitely support the population it has now (environmental degradation is already out of control), so imagine a world in which everyone wants our standard of living. We must all learn to live simply, but with fewer people as well.

The conclusions can only be that a population problem exists, it is grave and it is destroying the beauty of the planet, and it is firmly rooted in the Powers that Be.

### Insinuations
Betsy Hartmann's article contains a number of clear-cut insinuations that are essentially lies themselves. The first is that population control is a major factor in US policy, particularly foreign policy. In fact, the government's position on the mere existence of a population problem has been weak and vacillating at most. Indeed, Ronald Reagan's "Mexico City Policy" flatly denied that a population problem existed, and while a few in the current administration may admit to concern, they are neither a majority nor advocate it as their highest priority. Note, for example, that the Foreign Appropriations bill disproportionately cuts international family planning. Nor will anyone at EPA articulate a policy on population and the environment.

The second insinuation is all those who have valid concerns over population blame all world problems on that problem alone. In reality, nobody claims that solving the population problem will automatically eliminate poverty, environmental degradation or instability. A number do claim that not solving it must ultimately make it impossible to solve these and many other problems. Moreover, Hartmann's conclusion — that the world's still rapid population growth (more than the present US population every three years) will simply stop at an acceptable level of its own accord — is at best premature.

The third false insinuation is that all who actively promote smaller family sizes are closet racists with an evil hidden agenda. The truth is most who advocate measures to limit population growth do so as an integrated part of policies to improve women's and children's health and choices. The 1994 UN International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo make this clear. The central question is how to solve the population problem in a humane and democratic fashion, since it is otherwise guaranteed to eventually solve itself — in a fashion nobody likes. The first, most important step is to recognize that the problem exists and will get worse before it gets better.

For these reasons, the false implications in this article can be called a significant contributor to poverty, environmental degradation, and instability. As Nafis Sadik said in her Keynote Address to the Cairo Conference, "Population programmes are above all investments in humanity. The first to benefit from such investments are the most vulnerable groups, the rural and urban poor, children and particularly women."

### Left Position on Population Wrong
While overconsumption by the wealthy nations is both deplorable and a major contributor to the poverty of other areas of the world, and while there is ample evidence that overpopulation is being used to scapegoat our responsibility for this situation by blaming the suffering of the poor on overpopulation alone, it is patent nonsense to argue, as the liberal/left press seems increasingly inclined to do, that a population explosion is not occurring and is not at the root of the problem. (See Lester Brown's Who Will Feed China.) An examination of the population trend since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, facilitated and compounded by a less-than-wise application of science, should redress this misunderstanding. The left, out of concern for the poor, substitutes human motivation, i.e., greed and power lust for the fact of out-of-control human reproduction. It thus does the same thing that the religious right does when it substitutes creationism for evolution because evolution contradicts its religious values/beliefs. It also places this element of the left in company with the Vatican.

**Betsy Hartmann Replies**
I was not surprised that my article on population elicited these responses. Population remains a controversial issue, left, right and center. I offer these points for consideration.

1) While world population is growing, it is true that birth rates are declining in most places in the world. Desired family size is also falling. There is a powerful demographic momentum built into our present numbers, particularly because there are so many people nearing or of reproductive age. But it is important to note the onset of demographic transition from high to low birth rates even in countries like Kenya which once had one of the highest birth rates in the world.

2) Garrett Hardin is hardly a good source on the demographic transition. He has advocated famine as a way to reduce population and cut-offs of foreign assistance to needy countries. His life-boat ethics are infamous. Hardin has links with right-wing eugenics and anti-immigration groups and has been funded by the Pioneer Fund, the major US eugenics foundation, and is an adviser to the Federation for American Immigration Control, Population-Environment Balance, and Americans for Immigration Control. It is not a myth, or even a radical view, that birth rates generally decline when people have access to health, education, employment and social security systems outside the family — read a demography textbook. Or look at the experience of Taiwan, Korea, Kerala state in India, Cuba, Sri Lanka...

3) Population control has been a consistent, if not a dominant, theme in US foreign policy since the 1970s. The US has also exercised much influence over multilateral aid organizations and national governments in regard to population policy. It is true that Cairo has ushered in reforms (wider reproductive health services vs. just family planning, greater attention to choice and women's rights, etc.). These changes are welcome and are largely the result of pressure from the international women's movement. Implementation is problematic, however, and there are battles going on inside the US Agency for International Development between the old guard and reformers. There are also major issues concerning the choice of contraceptive technology in US-funded programs. Do you promote Norplant or the condom, for example? And then, of course, there is pressure from right-wing anti-abortion forces to cut off aid to family planning. I believe reproductive rights activists should keep pushing for reforms of US policy, while continually differentiating themselves from both the population control establishment and the right wing.

4) An interesting irony is how the Clinton administration now promotes itself as the defender of women's rights overseas, while endorsing welfare and immigration reforms at home which directly threaten the health of millions of women and children. It may be that our domestic population policy is becoming much worse now than our international one. I also remain concerned about the rhetoric of "the greening of security" which blames population pressure on resources for political violence in the Third World. This is a growing trend which needs to be challenged by progressive environmentalists, peace activists, and others.

5) I don't think everyone in the population field is a racist, but check out Robert Kaplan's book The Ends of the Earth if you want to see an example of racism in population and environment discourse.

6) If you really want to address rapid population growth, address poverty, social injustice, and women's rights as worthwhile goals in and of themselves. Certainly, it's politically riskier in the present environment to take this line, but it's good politics, common sense, and builds bridges between people instead of erecting unnecessary barriers in the name of population control.

## CAQ Briefs

### Credi-bull
Since the Gulf War, thousands of vets have experienced debilitating and sometimes deadly illnesses; 60,000 have requested special screening to check for Gulf War syndrome. But the vets had a credibility problem: The Pentagon denied the existence of the syndrome and told them it was all in their heads.

In the winter 1992-93 issue of CAQ, Tod Ensign explored possible causes of the syndrome, detailed the extent of troop illness, and reported that international monitors had found traces of chemical weapons. Then, in an award-winning summer 1995 CAQ article, Dennis Bernstein detailed the exposure of US troops to chemical weapons when they exploded Iraqi ordnance and how the Pentagon and White House lied to cover up the incidents.

But CAQ also had a credibility problem: The military denied everything. On April 26, 1995, Assistant Secretary of Defense John Deutch testified at confirmation hearings for his appointment as CIA director. Repeatedly asked if there was no evidence of chemical weapons Deutch replied unequivocally: "That's correct."

Then, lo and behold, this spring, Pentagon officials admitted that US troops had been exposed to sarin (the same deadly nerve agent used in the Tokyo subway attacks), and to mustard gas (a blistering agent that can burn flesh and lungs). And, it turns out, top government officials had known it all along: A Nov. 12, 1991 military action report, not released to the public but obtained by Bernstein, confirmed that when US troops exploded Iraqi bunkers in Kamisiyah, chemical weapons agents were released. The priority document had been prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and sent to the DIA, CIA, White House situation room, and the Secretary of State. Finally, this August, the Pentagon volunteered that there had been no fewer than seven such incidents. Not to worry, they reassured, there is no proven link between exposure to toxic chemicals and ill-effects suffered — or imagined by troops. Suddenly — five years after civilians and troops began falling ill, and only the Pentagon issued confirmation — the mainstream press is onto the story. In the New York Times, Philip Shenon noted that news of the exposures, "raised concerns about the credibility of the Department of Defense."

### Let Them Eat Microwaves or How Can They Live Like That?
A roof over your head? Health care? Enough to eat? A burial plot? Just what is it poor people want anyway? The conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute thinks it knows. Fed up with "defenders of the welfare state" who whine that 14.5 percent of Americans live in poverty, CEI has decided that poverty is relative. "[F]ew consider," notes its in-house organ CEI Update, "that the poor in America are substantially better off than the 'middle class' in many other countries. For example... [the] poor in the US are far more likely to own dishwashers and microwaves than people in most European countries."

### Ethics for Sale or Rent
Announcing the winner of the "Tom Lehrer Nothing-Left-to-Satirize Award." This prize is named after the satirical songwriter's explanation of why he was retiring: because he couldn't top the Nobel Peace Prize committee's decision to give its award to Henry Kissinger. CAQ's winner this year is a famous war criminal and relentless defender of the human right to murder, rape, and pillage in the name of democracy. Now regularly featured at gatherings of the Christian right where he is one of their token Jews, he gained his glory in the Iran-Contra scandal when he was an assistant secretary of state for the Reagan administration. A staunch friend of the Contras and bedfellow of the murderous Salvadoran and Guatemalan death squad regimes, he was convicted of withholding information from Congress and pardoned by Bush. Which is like being slapped with a traffic ticket because you parked illegally while spraying a schoolyard with automatic weapons fire and then getting the ticket fixed.

But that's all over now and he has acknowledged that the whole thing was "an error in judgment." Our winner of the "Nothing-Left-to-Satirize Award" was recently named president of the Ethics in Public Policy Center. Congratulations to Elliott Abrams.

### Upholding Standards
Soon you won't be able to blame the FBI every time overzealous investigators compile dossiers on political suspects, snoop on opposition party rivals, pore through medical records, or leak information on hapless subjects. The bureau has quietly "outsourced" its background checks of presidential appointees and other employment matters. In 1995, private contractors hired under Background Investigation Contract Services [BICS] conducted over 5,000 probes. Clinton's 1997 budget requests an additional 88 people and $4.1 million to help privatize the investigations. A March FBI report states, "When fully established, [BICS] will conduct all FBI background investigations throughout the US and Puerto Rico."

According to Charles Finnie, writing in Legal Times, private BICS contractors to the FBI will perform investigative fieldwork "such as interviewing past employers and roommates, delving into medical and financial records, and combing arrest reports. The material they come up with is then merged with other sources and lodged in the background files" — the same ones that are at the core of the recent White House scandal. The private background checkers, in addition to being required to have a fax machine and a driver's license, will have their own background check. (Perhaps cost cutting can be further enhanced if they simply investigate themselves.)

Meanwhile, for the last five years, the DEA has been farming out background checks through Varicon, a Virginia security company. Although the potential for abuse is glaring, attacks on the FBI scheme almost make you want to stand up and defend the privatization. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) warned that without the bureau in charge, "you lose accountability. ... What if somebody makes up stories? You can't fire them." Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), also distressed, imaginatively declared, "The FBI has a certain credibility." Said ex-Attorney General William Barr, "An impressionable person might put a flimsy rumor in their report, but FBI agents are trained to put everything in context." Bureau spokesperson Michael Korten reassured critics: If BICS contractors "don't consistently meet [the same standards as bureau agents], they are let go." Now don't you feel better?

### Maple Thief Rag
As bloody revolution spread through their country, 100,000 loyal citizens, fearing for life, limb, and liberty, refused to betray their government and fled to safety in the giant nation to the north. Despite the defeat of their cause, these plucky refugees never abandoned hope of regaining confiscated land and property.

Cubans hunkered down in Miami? Nope, it's those fiendish Canadians who have lulled us all these years with their deceitful image of bland friendliness. Now the mask is off. "We had to leave," said Liberal Canadian parliamentarian John Godfrey. "Like all the Cuban-Americans, we had to get out. We are the Contras of our time." In legislation that parallels Helms-Burton, Godfrey is seeking restitution of property stolen during the American Revolution. His law would also impose penalties on US holdings of businesses that once belonged to Loyalists and would revoke Canadian visas for Americans connected with those businesses. In addition to the return of his ancestral land in Virginia, Godfrey expects a big chunk of the eastern seaboard to revert to the Loyalists. "[W]e're talking billions of dollars in places like Manhattan and Philadelphia."

Those US critics charging that the Canadian bill is ludicrous were hard pressed to distinguish it from Helms-Burton, which Clinton — groveling shamelessly for South Florida votes and campaign contributions — recently signed. After its passage, the State Department banned nine Canadian executives from entering the US. Their Canadian companies had invested in Cuban property supposedly confiscated from Americans after Castro came to power. Clearly, it's time the US started worrying more about its other border — the longest unprotected boundary in the world. One vigilant Republican legislator from Miami has proposed striking back by kidnapping Canadian executives who "collaborated with Castro" and putting them on trial.

"Castro's days... are numbered," said Lincoln Diaz-Balart in July. Agents of "a free Cuba" (presumably himself and his gusano buddies), "will enforce the laws of Cuba even extra-territorially — grabbing a few investors to bring to trial à la Eichmann." Diaz-Balart was referring to the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann who was kidnapped by Israeli agents, tried and hanged in 1962. According to an aide, though, Diaz-Balart did not mean to equate Canadian CEOs with Nazi killers.

Jesse Helms, co-author of the US model for the Canadian bill also favored Nazi analogies. He likened Ottawa's stance toward Cuba to Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien responded that Canada had entered the war against Hitler in 1939, two years before the United States. Helms, undeterred by fact or sanity, continued: "It's painful to note," he said, "the hypocrisy of these countries. After all, the United States has rescued every one of them from tyranny at one time or another. And this is the thanks we get."

The senator was perhaps referring to the role the US is playing through the Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA in freeing Canadians from the oppressive yoke of universal health care, affordable higher education, and a functioning social safety net.

## The Burmese Gulag
**For 34 years the people of Burma have been ruled by a military junta as tyrannical and secretive as any in the modern era. Now, desperate for hard currency, the country's dictators are at pains to establish Burma as a vacation paradise. Posing as a travel consultant, John Pilger penetrated beyond this new tourist trail to uncover a nightmare world of intimidation, forced displacement, and slavery.**

**by John Pilger**

At dawn, in Burma's ancient capital of Pagan, crows glide without a quiver among the silhouettes of temples that rise like cathedrals in the desert. In Ananda, the most celebrated temple, there are four colossal standing Buddhas. As the light catches one of them, it is smiling. As you get closer the smile becomes enigmatic, then it fades. As you walk to one side and look back, the Buddha's expression is melancholy. Walk on and it becomes fear veiled in pride. I have not seen anything quite like it. For me it is the face of modern Burma.

Six years ago, more than 4,000 people lived in Pagan, a city which stands alone of the last wonders of the ancient world. They were given two weeks to leave, some only a few days. The city was being opened to mass tourism, and only guides and the staff of a planned strip of hotels were permitted to stay. The people's homes were bulldozed and they were marched at gunpoint to a shadeless, waterless stubble that is a dust bowl in the dry season and runs with mud during the monsoon. Their new houses are of straw and poor-quality bamboo and stand mostly out of sight of the tour buses that come down the new and empty dual carriageway. Those villagers who objected were sent out onto the barren plain, or beaten, or taken away in the night.

The dispossession was mild by the standards of the dictator Ne Win and the generals who have ruled Burma since a military coup in 1962 crushed the democratically elected government. Last year the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions reported that in Rangoon alone, a million people had been forced from their homes in preparation for tourism and foreign investment. Throughout Burma perhaps three million people have been brutally swept up and exiled to "satellite zones" where they are compelled to serve Burma's new facade of "economic growth."

Arriving in Rangoon on a Sunday afternoon, there is a veneer of normality. Frangipani blossoms perfume the air and incense fills the covered bridges that lead to the stupas surrounding the great golden pagoda of Shwedagon. Families seek the intonation of a passing monk, though there is a furtiveness about them all. Rowers glide on Inya Lake; behind them, work on high-rise tourist hotels proceeds at a frenzied pace. There are surreal touches. A billboard advertising Lucky Strike cigarettes has "Welcome to Yangon" in the space otherwise allotted to a cancer warning. "Yangon" is the name the military regime has given Rangoon; Burma is "Myanmar," which is the equivalent of the German government insisting that the rest of the world call their country Deutschland. A billboard near the airport announces "Visit Myanmar Year 1996" beneath a cartoon picture of a Burmese Betty Boop. On the next street is the headquarters of Military Intelligence, known to the Burmese as "Em-eye." It is Burma's KGB and, alongside the old tyrant Ne Win and the army, it is the power in the land and the source of what the United Nations special rapporteur has described as "an atmosphere of pervasive fear."

For arriving foreign tourists and businesspeople, the drive to their hotel inevitably includes a short detour along University Avenue. To the uninitiated, this has a frisson of the forbidden and seditious. Number 54 is the home of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the Burmese democracy movement, Aung San Suu Kyi. Here, until her release last July, she spent six years under house arrest. At this time, every Saturday and Sunday, she was allowed to speak from over her garden gate to several thousand supporters corralled behind barbed wire barriers. This was not so much a concession by the regime as a showcase for the new "openness" of "Visit Myanmar 1996." A busload of Taiwanese tourists was just ahead of me, snapping pictures through the tinted glass. What struck me was the extraordinary courage of the Burmese who came to listen to her — in doing so they branded themselves as opponents of the regime — and the Kafka-like absurdity of the country's elected leader having to address people while on a platform behind her garden fence.

Since her "unconditional" release, Suu Kyi has been denied freedom of movement. On a recent attempt to leave Rangoon, she boarded a train to Mandalay only to find her carriage adrift at the station as the train pulled out. She cannot freely associate with anyone. Those Burmese who pass through her gate take a risk: Their names are noted and they can expect a call in the night. Shortly before I interviewed her, eight members of a dance troupe who had celebrated Independence Day with her "disappeared." They include the popular comedians U Pa Pa Lay and Lu Zaw, who are said to have made a joke about the generals. Each has since been sentenced to seven years' hard labor. Since May, the regime has detained several hundred members of Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, and has banned her "garden gate" meeting (a prohibition she has so far successfully ignored).

Aung San Suu Kyi lived in Britain for many years before she returned to Burma, and her family lives there still. Her husband, the British Tibetologist Michael Aris, has once again been refused permission to visit her. This also applies to their two sons, whose Burmese nationality was long ago canceled. The official newspaper, the New Light Of Myanmar, attacks her regularly and with mounting viciousness. She is "obsessed by lust and superstition"; she "swings around a bamboo pole brushed with cess"; she is "drowning in conceit" and "it is pitiable and at once disgusting to see a person [like her] suffering from insanity... now at a demented stage." Aung San Suu Kyi dismisses all this with a laugh that is brave, though difficult to share.

Of course, the reason for such intimidation is her popularity, which could not be greater. At the mention of her name, the contrived neutrality of faces, by which people survive, breaks into smiles. People whisper her name as you brush them in a market, then turn and put a finger to their lips. And if you are able to speak and disclose that you have been to see her, all caution is discarded and questions about her well-being pour forth. But along with expressions of admiration, affection, and solidarity are fears for her safety and the recognition that she, and the democracy movement, may be trapped. "She is a Mandela without a De Klerk," a close friend of hers told me. "Unless pressure comes from the very governments that the regime is now courting in Asia and the West, nothing will change for a long time." Aung San Suu Kyi herself told me that foreign investment and tourism were shoring up the power of the junta, and that the world must realize the scale of Burma's human rights abuses, particularly forced labor. "News comes and goes like fashion," she said. "After the people rose up in 1988 and paid the price in bloodshed, we slipped from the headlines. It will be a pity if we slip again."

In February, the UN Commission on Human Rights reported, as it does every year, that the following violations were commonplace in Burma: "Torture; summary and arbitrary executions, forced labor, abuse of women, politically motivated arrests and detention, forced displacement, important restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association and oppression of ethnic and religious minorities...." Take at random any of the reports by Amnesty International and what distinguishes the Burmese junta from other modern tyrannies is slave labor. "Conditions in the labor camps," reports one study, "are so harsh that hundreds of prisoners have died as a result.... Military Intelligence personnel regularly interrogate prisoners to the point of unconsciousness. Even the possession of almost any reading material is punishable. Elderly, sick, and even handicapped people are placed in leg-irons and forced to work."

In Britain, tourism to Burma, a former British colony and repository of much imperial nostalgia, has become a lucrative business. Pick up a travel brochure these days from any of the famous names in British tourism — British Airways, Orient Express, Kuoni — and there is no problem. Indeed, to British Airways, Burma offers "the ultimate in luxury" and a "fabulous prize" for its Executive Club members. "To find an unspoilt country today may seem impossible, "extols the Orient Express brochure, "but Burma is such a place. It has retained its charm, its fascinating traditions... its easy-going ways are a tonic to the Western traveler." Moreover, this "truly unique experience" includes a "free lecture on Burma's history and culture." I inquired about this lecture. It makes no mention of the momentous events of 1988.

### Destroying Democracy
In 1988, the year before the democracy movement in China was destroyed so publicly in Tiananmen Square, the people of Burma rose up, and as many as 10,000 were killed by the army. Unlike the Chinese leadership, the generals in Rangoon moved quickly to curtail foreign media coverage. Although eyewitnesses reported the massacre, there were no professional TV cameras and no satellite images to shock the world. Troops had orders to shoot on sight anyone with a camera. On one tape smuggled out of Rangoon, the voices of two amateur Burmese cameramen are caught at the moment they were spotted by soldiers. "What shall we do?" asks one of them. His friend replies, "Keep on filming until they shoot us."

In April 1988, Suu Kyi returned from England where she had settled with her husband and two children to take care of her dying mother. Her father was Aung San, the revered national hero whose guerrillas were trained by the Japanese, but then turned against them during the occupation of World War II. Having helped to lay the foundations of a democratic state, and negotiated independence from Britain, he was assassinated in 1947. More than 40 years later, his daughter agreed to take on leadership of a renewed democracy movement; and it was her explicit demand for "the restoration of democracy" that led to her house arrest in 1989.

However, the generals did hold elections. Having banned canvassing, threatened the electorate, and disbarred and silenced Aung San Suu Kyi, they were confident they had fragmented the National League for Democracy (NLD), and that their own front would gain the largest bloc of seats. It was a miscalculation "of historic proportion and unfathomable stupidity," said a former British diplomat based in Rangoon. The NLD won 82 percent of seats in the new parliament. Stunned, the junta responded by arresting 3,000 NLD workers and handing out prison sentences of up to 25 years to those of the newly elected parliamentarians who tried to establish the government.

The euphemism for oppression was the now familiar "economic stability." Having re-invented themselves as the State Law and Order Council, which goes by the fine Orwellian acronym, SLORC, the generals declared Burma "open to free enterprise." At the same time, in order to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure — roads, bridges, airports, railways — they set about turning the country into a vast labor camp. Last year, the moat around the imperial palace in Mandalay was excavated and restored almost entirely by forced labor, including chain gangs guarded by troops. When photographic evidence of this practice was produced, the regime claimed that "contributing labor" was "a noble Burmese tradition" and, anyway, many of the workers were convicted criminals who had "volunteered to work in the open air." In totalitarian Burma the term "convicted criminal" can embrace someone guilty of having been elected to office or of handing out leaflets calling for democracy (five years' hard labor), or of singing a song the generals don't like (seven years' hard labor).

There is a terrible irony in the building of the railway. During World War II, some 100,000 Burmese and other Asians died alongside 16,000 British and Allied soldier-slaves on the Japanese "death railway" that linked Burma with Thailand. Outside the gates of the Commonwealth war cemetery at Thanbyuzayat in the south of Burma, the death railway is still there. The same rusted lines rest on the same sleepers: A life was lost for every sleeper laid, one survivor calculated. A Japanese locomotive stands as it was abandoned on the day the horror ended. It is jet black and on the track in front of it is a square of barbed wire enclosing three figures rendered in cement — a Japanese guard with a rifle and two emaciated, shaven-headed POWs working with pick axes.

Now, history is repeating itself. An extension of this line is being built in Mon State, between Ye and Tavoy on the Andaman Sea. This is Burma's great secret. Although human rights organizations have documented the testimonies of the slave workers on the new death railway, few outsiders have seen it and the slave camps along the route. This is because much of Mon State is closed to foreigners. It is Burma's gulag.

### Slaves of SLORC
In making a film for British television, my film-making partner David Munro and I entered the country under the subterfuge of travel consultants. We headed south, leaving Rangoon well before dawn, traveling over spine-gutting roads, often without headlights. We passed watchtowers and groups of prisoners in chains, quarrying rock. Those guards at roadblocks were junior, asleep, or uninterested; money fluttered across to them. The towns in this remote part of the country are a step back in time, as if the British Raj were temporarily away at the hill stations. Ancient sewing machines whirred on balconies; the roads were filled with bicycles, not cars; carbon paper, radiograms, and sleeveless sweaters were for sale. Tavoy has streets of decorous teak houses, the biggest with lace iron balconies. Others are dungeon-like, with iron bars and damp trickling over torn posters of coy women holding parasols.

People considered us with due curiosity; a whole generation here has seldom laid eyes on Europeans. To talk openly to foreigners is to beckon interrogation and worse. Hotels must copy guest registration forms to as many as 14 different authorities. On the day we arrived in Tavoy all "independent travelers" were told they had to leave. Fortunately, all the roads out were closed, and the ancient Dutch-manufactured Fokker aircraft of Myanmar Airways had been commandeered by a general. We calculated that we had about a day and a night to find the railway before we were caught. Following the line of embankments north into the jungle, we succeeded in getting lost, then by chance came upon a clearing that presented what might have been a tableau of Victorian England. Scores of people were building embankments and a bridge across a dry river bed that is now, with the arrival of the monsoon, an ochre-colored torrent. From out of jungle so dense that its bamboo and foliage formed great wickerwork screens, they were carving the railway. A 20-foot-high embankment had been built with earth dug by hoe and hand from huge holes. The skilled were paid about $.50 a day. The majority were slave laborers, of whom many were children. Laboriously and clumsily the child workers wrested clay from the excavations, sharing a hoe among three. One little girl in a long blue dress struggled to wield a hoe taller than herself, then fell back exhausted and with a wince, held her shoulder.

The children carried heavy loads of mud mixed with straw in baskets and dishes on their heads and clearly agonized under the weight. They poured them into a vat and grinder, turned by two tethered oxen. The sticky clay, now almost as hard as rock, was gathered by two children, one of them small enough to fit up to his shoulders in a hole directly beneath the grinder. Horrified, I watched a load of clay, like fresh cement, tip over him, almost burying him. I reached under his arms and pulled him out. The others laughed, as if this was normal. How many children are trapped and injured and die like that? As many as 300 adults and children have been killed or have died from disease and exhaustion, according to one estimate. There were at least 20 other bridges in the vicinity and children were working on all of them.

Every village along the way must give its labor "voluntarily," regardless of age or the state of people's health. Advanced pregnancy is no excuse. If people protest that, as peasant farmers, their labor is all they have to keep them and their families alive, they are fined and their possessions confiscated. If a whole village objects, the head man is beaten or killed and all the houses razed.

"I saw one old man accidentally drop his load into the river," a former civil servant told me in a nearby safe area controlled by the Karen National Union. "As he tried to retrieve it, the soldiers shot him in the head. I could see the water turn red with his blood, then the river carried him away." A man who escaped with his wife told me: "I saw people dying because of landslides or fever. Some of the bodies were never found, only the head or a foot. They didn't bother to bury the bodies properly, with a funeral. They just dug a hole and left them there." His wife, Min, said, "I feel for the children. They are too young to anticipate danger, so they are vulnerable. They are the ones who die first." I asked her if she knew why she was being forced to work in this way. "We were told nothing," she said. "We overheard we were building a railway so that a French oil company could run a pipeline through, and foreigners came to look over the site." The oil company is a partnership between a US company, Unocal, and Total, which is part-owned by the French government. They are building a $1 billion pipeline that will carry Burma's natural gas into Thailand. The deal will give the Rangoon generals about $400 million a year over 30 years. Since they put an end to democracy in 1990, it is estimated that SLORC has received 65 percent of its financial backing from foreign oil companies, including Britain's Premier Oil and America's Texaco and ARCO.

In its 1993 report on human rights abuses throughout the world, the US State Department says SLORC "routinely" uses slave labor and "will use the new railway to transport soldiers and construction supplies into the pipeline area." Unocal says reports of slave labor are a "fabrication" and both the oil companies deny the railway is linked to the pipeline project. But more than 5,000 troops have already been shipped to the pipeline area and army patrols protect Total personnel.

Although taken aback by the sudden arrival of two Europeans on the embankments, the chief engineer admitted to me that the railway was being built mainly with "volunteers." He said that the children made bricks for the army, which sold them to the construction company. As we talked, soldiers guarding the "volunteers" began to emerge from their tent. We left expeditiously.

### Helping Hands
Western entrepreneurs in Burma claim that foreign investment has multiplied tenfold since 1992. "It's not so much a gradual pick up," said Pat James, a Texas businessman, "as a skyrocket." This claim is disputed by, among others, a recent report in The Economist. The World Bank and IMF have yet to lend the generals a penny. However, what has begun in Burma is a familiar process in which a dictatorship's crimes against its people are obscured and "forgotten" as foreign businesspeople seek to justify what the East Asian governments and the US call "positive engagement" and the Europeans and Australians call "critical dialogue." The prize is a cheap labor colony that promises to undercut even China and Vietnam.

Most Western governments, together with Japan, are running a "two track policy" on Burma: offering public support for Aung San Suu Kyi while pursuing, often in secret, long-term business links with SLORC. Tax havens, such as the British Virgin Islands, are used to move money to Burma; this is the route used by Unocal, the US oil company.

In spite of criticism by the Clinton administration and Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent description of a "new tide of repression in Burma," US policy is business as usual: "not to encourage or discourage trade." After visiting Rangoon in June and "conferring" with SLORC, President Clinton's special envoy, William Brown, praised the role of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, which has since offered SLORC full membership. Calling ASEAN "that noble organization," Brown reaffirmed US policy as "constructive engagement" with Burma. (This was the term used by the Reagan administration for US support of the apartheid regime in South Africa). Brown also said that "the issue of forced labor has diminished" — in the week that the International Labor Organization reported that SLORC was forcing its people into forced labor "on a massive scale and under the cruellest of conditions." In a letter to the Far Eastern Economic Review, a State Department official, John Shattuck, sought to play down Brown's remarks. "While there are undoubtedly fluctuations in the use of forced and compulsory labor within Burma," he wrote, "the fact remains that such serious violations of internationally recognized worker rights are widespread and remain a matter of grave concern to the United States."

The "two-track" policy is exemplified by the role of Britain. While Nelson Mandela was in London last July, feted by a British establishment that once did everything in its power to undercut him, his fellow Nobel Peace Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi — "Asia's Mandela" — was being quietly abandoned, with the British now undercutting her. On June 12, a day Suu Kyi appealed to the world not to do business with SLORC, a senior official of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry arrived in Rangoon to "evaluate the commercial prospects" of British support for the regime. Mike Cohen, head of export sales to Asia, met an official of the SLORC's investment agency in the week the junta decreed a 20-year prison sentence for anyone attending meetings outside Suu Kyi's home. On the day Cohen flew into Rangoon, Jeremy Hanley, the British Foreign Office minister, told Parliament that the British Government supported "democratic reform and human rights" in Burma. "We have made it clear to SLORC," he said, "that the resumption of normal relations is conditional on progress in those key areas. He added that the Department of Trade had "pulled the plug" on future British trade missions to Rangoon.

What the minister neglected to say was that, even as he rose to address Parliament, Cohen was flying into Rangoon to "evaluate" the next trade mission. In fact, the British government has funded two recent trade missions to Burma and an international seminar in London called, "An introduction to Burma — the latest Tiger Cub," at which speakers described "the real visionaries" in SLORC.

For all the European Union's pretensions on human rights, European companies, backed by their governments, are among SLORC's biggest underwriters. The Total oil company, building the oil and gas pipeline for the regime, is part-owned by the French Government. Germany is SLORC's longtime supplier of weapons-grade machine tools. On July 15, a meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels formally blocked a call by the European Parliament for sanctions against Burma. At the same time, the EU Council of Ministers "welcomed" Burma's membership of ASEAN's Regional Forum.

So it is with Japan, another of SLORC's major underwriters. Although Japanese foreign minister Ikeda Yukihiko is said to have privately criticized SLORC, Tokyo continues to hand the junta $48.7 million in "aid." The great zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Honda, and Nippon Steel are in Rangoon. NHK, the Japanese national broadcaster, has issued a remarkable directive that the video footage it owns showing the Burmese army shooting down demonstrators "is prohibited for use by anybody in the world, even by NHK in Japan, because it's too delicate and might threaten Myanmar's (Burma's) stability.... Please erase the material in your library."

And so it is with Australia. On July 22, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer was reported in the Australian press to have taken "a tough line" on human rights abuses in Burma. He immediately contradicted this by declaring that Australia "would not stand in the way of Burmese membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum." In the last year, the number of Australian business delegations visiting Rangoon has doubled. The largest fence in Burma, advertising the Australian beer, Foster's, shields an army watchtower from the gaze of tourists.

By far Burma's biggest backer is China, which has armed SLORC on a barter system that has seen many of Burma's natural riches, such as its gemstones and teak, go to China. Chinese business interests are now so well ensconced that Mandalay is often referred to as "a Chinese city." Leading the "tiger" investors is Singapore, whose state arms company came to SLORC's rescue in 1988 at the height of the pro-democracy demonstrations when troops were running out of ammunition.

The collaboration of Thailand has been critical to SLORC's survival. The Thai Petroleum Authority will be the sole importer and consumer of the gas that comes through the French/US-built pipeline. The deal is little different from the logging, mining, and fishing concessions which Thai interests have negotiated with Rangoon since "development" in their own country has all but destroyed its principal natural resources.

Part of the unstated deal is that the Thai military sends back Burmese refugees who manage to cross the border. In April 1993, Thai troops burned down two refugee camps in an operation, reported the Bangkok Nation, "probably related to the gas pipeline." Thousands of ethnic Mon refugees have since been forced back into Burma, many straight into the hands of the SLORC military. On the border, where the pipeline will enter Thailand, SLORC troops display pens distributed by the French oil company, Total, in their uniform pockets. "Total is coming," said one of them with a broad smile.

Burma's most profitable export is illegal. More than half the heroin reaching the streets of US and Australian cities originates in the "golden triangle" where the borders of Burma, Laos, and Thailand meet. Under SLORC, heroin production has doubled. In a study, *Out of Control*, two researchers, Dr. Chris Beyrer and Faith Doherty, conclude from a long investigation for the South-East Asian Information Network that SLORC has allowed heroin to circulate freely and cheaply in Burma in the hope that it "pacifies" the rebellious young. According to his son, the infamous drug lord Kuhn Sa is living comfortably on Inya Lake in the center of Rangoon with the support of military intelligence.

While drugs bring in quick cash, it is tourism on which SLORC pins its hopes for foreign exchange and, above all, international respectability. "At last the doors to Myanmar, the magic golden land, are open," waxes Dr. Naw Angelene, the director of tourism, in an official handout. "Roads will be wider, lights will be brighter, tours will be cleaner, grass will be greener, and with more job opportunities, people will be happier." One of the biggest foreign tour operators in Burma is the Orient Express Group, which operates "The Road To Mandalay," a "champagne-style cruise" between Mandalay and Pagan in a converted Rhine cruiser. The cabins, says the brochure, "are not simply luxurious"; there is a Kipling Bar and a swimming pool.

When I found it at anchor in the heat and mosquitoes, *The Road To Mandalay* looked squat and sturdy rather than luxurious. Once on board, however, it seemed the perfect vehicle for pampering tourists in one of the world's 10 poorest countries. Like an air-conditioned bubble, it is constantly cleansed of the smells and noise and dust of the land through which it glides. In the "staterooms" the television rises at the foot of the bed and, presto, there is Rupert Murdoch's satellite TV. In February, the captain of *The Road To Mandalay* welcomed his inaugural guests. "They might have been, the cast from an Edwardian novel" wrote London Times travel writer Peter Hughes, "a prince and two princesses from the Endsleigh League of European Royalty, our own Princess Michael of Kent among them; a duke; a marche and marchese; a film star, Helena Bonham-Carter; and assorted lords and ladies whose names tended to be the same as their addresses. Those without titles merely had money." The actual road to Mandalay has recently been converted into an expressway for tourists. For the local people forced to work on it, it is known as "the road of no return." According to Amnesty International, two workers who tried to escape were executed on the spot by soldiers. Another eight were beaten until they were severely injured; one was hacked to death with a hoe.

When I interviewed James Sherwood, the American chair of Sea Containers, which runs the Road to Mandalay tours, he described the Burmese generals as "rather bright, well educated, dedicated men who are trying to improve the country." He said he had contacted the CIA about the "allegations" of human rights violations and it was "confirmed to me these allegations were untrue."

Aung San Suu Kyi was two years old when her father was murdered. What distinguished the movement he founded was its complex attempt to apply a blend of Buddhism, socialism, and democracy to the freely elected governments that followed. The ideas of Nehru, Sun Yat Sen, Manzini, and Voltaire were adapted. Marx was virtually reinvented as a disciple of Buddha. But this flowering coincided with a period of turmoil as the ethnic peoples demanded autonomy. In March 1962, the army stepped in and seized power. Its leader, Ne Win, became Burma's Stalin. He displaced whole populations, built labor camps, and filled the prisons with his enemies, real and imagined. His wars against the ethnic peoples were unrelenting and vengeful. He abolished Burma's lively free press; and along the way he made himself extremely rich. In 1984, the Far Eastern Economic Review reported that the privately chartered jet taking him to a Swiss health clinic "was delayed because chests of jade and precious stones carried on board had been stacked incorrectly and had to be reloaded." Three years later Burma ignominiously applied for Least Developed Country status so that it could qualify for relief on its massive foreign debt.

In 1987, the leader who dubbed himself "Brilliant as the Sun" produced his coup de grace. Without warning, he withdrew most of the country's banknotes, replacing them with new denominations that included or added up to the number nine. According to his chief astrologer, nine was Ne Win's lucky number. The people of Burma did not share his luck. As most of them kept their savings in cash, most were ruined.

In a nation now so impoverished, the fuse was lit. By March 1988, the regime was at war with the students at Rangoon University. The moment of uprising came precisely at eight minutes past eight on the morning of the eighth month of 1988. This was the auspicious time the dock workers, the "first wave," chose to strike. Other workers followed in succession; and in subsequent days and weeks almost everyone in the cities and towns, it seemed, showed a courage equal to those who stormed the Berlin Wall the following year. Without guns, ordinary people began to reclaim their country. Then the slaughter began. The army fired point blank at the crowds and bayoneted those who fell. In Thailand and Norway, I have interviewed the exiled witnesses to these epic events, most of them speaking publicly for the first time. "One of my friends was shot in the head right there, in front of me," said Ko Htun Oo, a former student. "Two girls and a monk were shot next to him." Another student, Aye Chan, said, "A lot of flame was coming out of the crematorium which was surrounded by troops. They weren't even identifying bodies, so the parents would never know. The dead and wounded were all mixed up. They just burned them alive." Another spoke of hearing a wounded schoolboy cry out for his mother as he was buried alive in the cemetery: "The caretaker didn't want to do it," he said, "but the soldiers had guns pointed at him."

Now well into his 80s, Ne Win remains the center of SLORC's power. His former aide, the secret police chief, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, is "Secretary One." Behind sunglasses, Khin Nyunt's pudgy face appears at least five times in every copy of the official daily. His seminal work goes under the catchy title, "The Conspiracy Of Treasonous Minions Within The Myanmar Naing-Ngan And Traitorous Cohorts Abroad." One wonders how many of the gallery of faces in its pages are dead. Pol Pot and his gang turned out similar tracts. "Secretary One" is the man whose job is silencing "heretics": those like the lawyer Nay Min serving 14 years for "spreading rumors" to the BBC, and the UNICEF researcher Khin Zaw Win serving 15 years for sending "fabricated news" to the UN, and the writer San San Nwe sentenced to 10 years for "spreading false information injurious to the state." Last year the general subjected a US senator, John McCain (R-Ariz.), to an hour-long harangue about how SLORC was holding back the "red tide," then played him a videotape showing "communists" beheading villagers with machetes: footage so sickening that McCain's wife had to leave the room. The aim was to convince the senator that Aung San Suu Kyi was a front for "red subversives."

### Democratic Legacy
The taxi dropped us far from the long green fence of number 54 University Avenue. Our cameras were concealed in shoulder bags; a figure in sunglasses stood up to watch us. We peered through a hole in the corrugated iron gate and a face asked our names. Inside, another sunglasses told us to write down our names and occupations. We then crossed an imaginary line into friendly territory and were greeted warmly by Suu Kyi's assistant, U Win Htein, who was arrested with her and spent six years in prison, mostly in solitary confinement. He led us into the house, a stately pile fallen on hard times, overlooking a garden that tumbles down to Inya Lake and bordered by a fence equipped with alarms, a reminder that this was one woman's prison.

Aung San Suu Kyi wore silk and orchids in her hair. She is a striking, glamorous figure who looks much younger than her 50 years and appears at first to carry her suffering lightly. Only in repose does her face offer a glimpse of the cost and the grit that has seen her through, though when she laughs this vanishes; it is like a blind closed and open.

We talked in a room dominated by a huge portrait of the father she barely knew, painted in the style of Andy Warhol by the artist Soe Moe at the height of the 1988 uprising. I asked her if her release from house arrest was a cynical exercise by the regime to give itself a human face. "I think they also miscalculated that the National League For Democracy was a spent force," she replied," and that releasing me was not going to make any difference...."

"But with such a brute force confronting you," I asked, "how do you reclaim the power you won at the ballot box?" "We are not the first people to face this dilemma. In Buddhism we are taught the four basic ingredients for success: first, you must have the will to want it; then you must have the right kind of attitude; then you must have the perseverance; then wisdom...." What struck me was her extraordinary optimism, fueled, it seemed, by her Buddhist principles that draw a stark contrast with the realities outside. This changed when I mentioned foreign investment. I said that the British Foreign Office minister, Jeremy Hanley, had told Parliament that "through commercial contacts with democratic nations such as Britain, the Burmese people will gain experience of democratic principles."

She laughed. "Not in the least bit, because the so-called market economy is only open to some. Investors will help only a small elite to get richer and richer. This works against the very idea of democracy because the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time. The same applies to tourism. They should stay away until we are a democracy. Look at the forced labor that is going on all over the country. A lot of it is aimed at the tourist trade. It's very painful. Roads and bridges are built at the expense of the people. If you cannot provide one laborer you are fined. If you cannot afford the fine, the children are forced to labor."

In his moving introduction to *Freedom From Fear*, a collection of essays by and about Aung San Suu Kyi, Michael Aris quotes from a letter she wrote him shortly before they married: "I only ask one thing: that should my people need me, you would help me to do my duty by them — if we love and cherish each other as much as we can while we can, I am sure love and compassion will triumph in the end." I reminded her about this. "I asked him," she said, "to be sympathetic when the time came... and he said, 'yes'.... During my house arrest the longest period we were out of touch was two years and four or five months. I missed my family, and I worried about my sons very much because the young one was only 12, and he had to be put into boarding school. But then I'd remind myself that the families of my colleagues in prison were far worse off." She revealed that in her isolation she had difficulty breathing and would lie awake listening to the thump-thump of her heart, wondering if it would fail. There were times when she did not get enough to eat and her weight fell to 90 pounds.

"Weren't you terrified?" I asked. "When I was small," she said, "it was in this house that I conquered my fear of the dark. I just wandered around in the darkness and by the end, I knew all the demons weren't there." During the first years of her house arrest, soldiers were ordered to lie with their ears to the ground so as to detect her "tunneling" to the house next door. They failed to grasp that she had no intention of escaping, or seeking exile. Outside, her name became a byword and people would pass her house just to be reassured by the sound of her playing the piano. When it stopped there were rumors that she was dead. "That was when the string broke," she said. "I was pumping too hard. I have a hot temper, so I took it out on the piano!" "Will Burma be free in the foreseeable future?" "Yes!" she replied unhesitatingly. "That's not just a dream?" "No, I calculate it from the will of the people and the current of world opinion. ... I knew I'd be free some day."

The next day I joined the crowd outside her gate waiting for her to speak. The people were different from any I had seen; they were smiling, talking freely with each other, as if waiting for a gig to start. There were betel nut sellers and cheroot vendors and a man with a block of ice ingeniously balanced in a red sock, selling cups of cold water. With the grace and courtesy that is never deferential and is so much part of the Burmese character, people made way for the foreign Gulliver, offering a cushion for me to sit on.

When Suu Kyi appeared she was flanked by two other figures of principle and courage: General Tin Oo and U Kyi Maung, a former colonel, the vice-chairmen of the NLD, both of whom have spent years in prison. The clapping and whooping lasted minutes. She now looked grey and drawn. Yet she had people in stitches as she carefully mocked the dictatorship, using irony and parable (so I was told; she spoke only in Burmese). As they laughed, I counted the spooks in sunglasses, filming, photographing, watching. Their arbitrary power was like a presence. Recently, a young man tried to ease the crush by moving the barrier and was bundled away and given a two-year sentence.

At the end of her speech, people asked questions. She leaned over the spikes in the fence and listened intently, replying expressively. An old monk pushed through and asked her if she would join him in prayer; and she did. Most did not linger. A man told me he never went straight home after a meeting. "If they follow you," he said, "things start to happen. The power goes off; the kids are sent home crying from school." When I asked him if 1988 could happen again, this time successfully, he said: "Imagine a pedestrian crosswalk. The traffic never seems to stop for the pedestrians. One or two dart across. The majority wait impatiently at the curb, then they surge across, until the traffic has lost all its power. Well, we are all back at the curb now, waiting impatiently." At that, he looked over my shoulder and walked quickly away.

Desmond Tutu-like Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner — said recently, "International pressure can change the situation in Burma. Tough sanctions, not constructive engagement, finally brought about a new South Africa. This is the only language that tyrants understand." What is hopeful is that there is the promise of sanctions in a remarkable disinvestment campaign already well underway in America. Based on the boycott of apartheid South Africa, selective purchasing laws have been enacted by a growing number of US cities, including San Francisco and Madison, Wisconsin. Massachusetts has passed its own selective purchasing law, which has brought pressure on corporations based in the state, such as Gillette — although Gillette says it is no longer in Burma. These make municipal contracts with companies that trade with or invest in Burma illegal. New York state is considering similar legislation; and one of the biggest investors in Burma, Pepsi Cola, with its headquarters in upstate New York, has partially withdrawn.

Rep. Byron Rushing, who wrote Massachusetts' selective purchasing law, told me: "In the case of South Africa, we were able to put pressure on a whole range of companies, like General Motors, Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, and most eventually withdrew. And that really added to the pressure on the white government. That was a victory. As for Burma, it's not going to happen overnight, but we have started. The civilized world should follow."

## Who Is Stealing Our Future: Industry's Toxic Addiction to Estrogen Mimickers & Endocrine Disrupters
**In 1994, industry released more than 1.1 billion pounds of toxins linked to human reproductive disorders. Only 1 percent of the 70,000 different synthetic chemicals and metals in commercial use is monitored. Despite grave public health threats, industry is fighting to keep polluting — and to keep the public in the dark.**

**by Pratap Chatterjee**

Polar bears in the Arctic circle and albatrosses in the middle of the Pacific were the last creatures that scientists expected to be threatened by synthetic chemicals. But the pristine wilderness and the pure ocean vastness are as extinct as the dodo — and just as much casualties of human activity. When the albatross population suffered a 3 percent drop in reproduction rates over the last few years, New Zealand researchers discovered abnormally high levels of synthetic chemicals in the birds' bodies. When polar bear reproduction dropped by more than half, Norwegian researchers documented levels of toxic chemicals in the animals that are 3 billion times higher than in the cold waters near which they live.

The recently published book, *Our Stolen Future*, brings together mounting scientific evidence that thousands of synthetic chemicals in common use are accumulating all along the food chain and are turning up everywhere from remote virgin forest to supermarket shelf. (See p. 17.) If the authors are right, a group of chemicals known as endocrine disruptors and hormone mimickers are undermining the health and genetic viability of hundreds of species, including humans. And because the implicated chemicals — including PCBs, chlorine, atrazine, DDT, and various plastics used to manufacture five gallon water containers and approximately half the canned goods in this country — are so widely used in agriculture and industry, the financial vitality and survival of many corporations is also at stake. Not surprisingly, then, in addition to calls for further investigation and research, the storm of controversy around the new studies implicating these chemicals has also sparked a counterattack funded and promoted by the corporations that would be affected by regulation or a ban.

### Mugging the Messengers
The way these chemicals work is to "mimic" or "block" estrogen and progesterone — natural chemicals known as hormones which instruct the body in how it should develop and reproduce. "Hormonally active synthetic chemicals are thugs on the biological information highway that sabotage vital communication. They mug the messengers or impersonate them. They jam signals. They scramble messages," write the authors of *Our Stolen Future*. For example: "Imagine what would happen if somebody disrupted communications during the construction of a large building so the plumbers did not get the message to install the pipes in half the bathrooms before the carpenters closed the building."

Now imagine that the chemicals that affect communications in the endocrine system are everywhere "in the finest caviar, in penguins in Antarctica, in the bluefin tuna served at a sushi bar in Tokyo, in the monsoon rains that fall on Calcutta, in the milk of a nursing mother in France, in the blubber of a sperm whale cruising the South Pacific."

Throw in a couple more alarming facts. Billions of pounds of these chemicals are pumped annually into the air, land, and water, but the amount required to disrupt reproduction cycles could be as low as one part in a trillion — equivalent to just one drop of liquid in the cars of a six-mile-long cargo train. Humans are particularly vulnerable since the concentration of many of these chemicals increases in animals high in the food chain. The reason is two-fold: First, the chemicals are "persistent," meaning they do not break down, and second, they are stored permanently in body fat so that when a larger animal eats smaller animals, the predator incorporates the pollutants of its prey.

Finally, perhaps the most devastating news of all is that some of the chemicals with weak endocrine disrupting effects on their own become far more dangerous when two or more of them are found together. Research conducted by two scientists from Tulane University in Louisiana — on four pesticides (chlordane, dieldrin, endosulfan, and toxaphene) and several different kinds of PCBs — showed that two or more such chemicals in combination could be as much as 1,600 times as powerful as the individual chemicals alone.

### Chemical Catastrophe
In the past, scientists looking for the harmful effects of chemical contamination have tended to focus on cancer. While there is evidence linking this class of chemicals to the 32 percent rise in breast cancer rates and the 126 percent increase in prostate cancer in recent years, the situation is more complex and far more alarming. "Humans in their relentless quest for dominance over nature may be inadvertently undermining their own ability to reproduce or to learn and think," warns *Our Stolen Future* co-author Theo Colburn. Exposure to estrogen mimicking or endocrine disrupting chemicals such as dioxin may not kill, but may, notes an EPA report, lead to "complex and severe effects including cancer, feminization of males and reduced sperm counts, endometriosis and reproductive impairment in females, birth defects, impaired intellectual development in children, and impaired immune defense against infectious disease."

These chemicals could also be a significant factor in the rapid disappearance of many species around the world, such as the golden toad in Costa Rica, panthers in the Florida Everglades, otters in England, and dolphins off the coast of Turkey. For example, after Tower Chemical spilled large quantities of dicofol, a pesticide closely related to DDT, into Lake Apopka in the early 1980s, alligators started appearing with penises so shrunken they could not reproduce. For fairly obvious reasons, though, the area which has galvanized the scientific community and the media is the link between these chemicals and a well-documented and dramatic drop in human sperm count around the world. Some 61 studies collected by Danish researchers, have shown that sperm counts in a number of European countries have fallen by half in the last 30 years, while those in rapidly industrializing countries in East Asia are dropping fast.

DES, (diethylstilbestrol) provided one of the first confirmed examples of how these chemicals can affect not only those who are directly exposed, but also future generations. In the late 1950s, and '60s this estrogen mimicker was prescribed to millions of women for a variety of problems. Grant Chemicals, one of the manufacturers, claimed that DES produced "bigger and stronger babies," while doctors handed it out to prevent miscarriages, suppress milk production, and as a "morning-after" contraceptive. It was not until the 1970s that researchers discovered that the drug dramatically increases chances of clear-cell cancer and severe damage to the reproductive tract that can result in ectopic pregnancies. (Pregnancies that develop in the fallopian tubes as opposed to the uterus can cause ruptures leading to severe bleeding and sometimes death.) DES is now suspected of having affected male offspring, and of possibly causing brain problems in children of both genders.

### Industry Fights Back
As they did when faced with evidence of the dangers of DES, tobacco, global warming, nuclear waste, and pesticides, industry leaders have denied that there are any problems, and mounted PR campaigns. Faced with a growing body of evidence on the impact of chemicals on the endocrine system, they have turned to industry-sponsored groups and scientists to disprove the studies available to potential litigants and quoted by environmental groups pushing for regulation.

One industry scientist with a long history of producing research that helped establish the safety of his employer's products was Bill Gaffey, a mathematician who retired in 1989 as director of epidemiology for Monsanto Corp. Gaffey published studies in 1980, a year after he started working for the chemical giant, to show that there was no evidence of unusual cancers among workers exposed to dioxin at a Monsanto plant in Nitro, West Virginia. The plant manufactured Agent Orange for chemical warfare in Vietnam. The study was important to Monsanto because it was facing hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of dollars in lawsuits by tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans and by former Monsanto workers, all claiming they had been harmed by exposure to dioxin-laden Agent Orange.

Peter Montague, editor of Rachel's Environment and Health Weekly, charges that the Gaffey study gave the Veterans Administration the "evidence" it wanted to justify denying medical benefits to the Agent Orange vets. Finally, the research allowed the EPA "to set generous limits on dioxin exposures for the American public, thus providing minimal regulation for politically powerful industries such as paper, oil, and chemicals," says Montague.

Gaffey's role may have gone beyond sycophant science. Lawyers involved in a 1984 worker lawsuit against Monsanto discovered that Gaffey had listed four workers as "unexposed" to dioxin when the same four workers had been classified as "exposed" to dioxin in a previous Monsanto study. Gaffey's co-author, who had worked on both studies, confirmed that the data had been cooked. Six years later the EPA acknowledged that the study was fraudulent and found that dioxin was a probable carcinogen.

Gaffey's role in countering the studies cited by cancer victims and environmental groups has been taken up by others. Among the most quoted scientists on this subject is Stephen H. Safe of Texas A&M University, who has published papers contending that the contribution of synthetic chemicals to disruption of endocrine systems is so "minuscule" that it amounts to less than one-thousandth of one percent of the amount of naturally occurring chemicals that have the same effect. He now tells reporters that the fears of environmentalists could be dangerous to the economy. "You could be talking about thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to get rid of some of these chemicals, all because of something that we have no compelling reason to believe is really a threat."

Safe, whose work is partly funded by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, is not the only industry-backed scientist to publish studies that dismiss the impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on human health. Last year, researchers from Dow Chemical and Shell Oil showed that the use of more complex statistical models could generate the conclusion that human sperm counts have been increasing, not decreasing, during the past 20 years. These industry-funded studies have been given a major boost by Gina Kolata, a New York Times reporter, who used studies by Safe and others as background material for three major articles that throw cold water on *Our Stolen Future*. Kolata ran into trouble, however, when she quoted several scientists as skeptical of the book when the scientists themselves did not feel that way: "(E)ven in quoting these contrarian scientists, Ms. Kolata deceives and misleads her readers by selectively distorting their views," charged Montague. When the New York Times did not publish protest letters from the misrepresented scientists, they bought advertising space to set the record straight.

Meanwhile, industry is actively lobbying to redirect the debate. In January 1991, chief executives of four major US paper companies — John A. Georges of International Paper, T. Marshall Hahn, Jr. of Georgia-Pacific, Furman C. Moseley of Simpson Paper, and Andrew C. Sigler of Champion International — went to see William Reilly, then head of EPA, to convince him to re-assess the impact of dioxin. A memo from the four to Reilly after the meeting described their satisfaction: "We were encouraged by what we perceived as your willingness to move expeditiously to re-examine the potency of dioxin and chloroform in light of the important new information that has been submitted with respect to those chemicals" which indicated the "prevailing view that low-level dioxin exposures do not pose a serious health threat." The EPA study, however, backfired on industry. In 1994, agency scientists concluded that dioxin probably causes cancer in wildlife and humans; harms the immune and reproductive systems in fish, birds, and mammals (including humans); and concluded that "there is no safe level of dioxin exposure and that any dose no matter how low can result in health damage."

### Looking to the Future
Industry, not satisfied with government studies, is commissioning its own investigations. The blandly named Endocrine Issues Coalition — put together by the American Crop Protection Association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, and the Society of Plastics Industry — recently released a research agenda. It includes studies on breast cancer, sperm quality, and endometriosis in humans; estrogen effects in wildlife; a dioxin mechanistic study; animal and aquatic toxicology studies; environmental chemistry; testing methods; exposure studies; and risk assessment. According to Ron Miller of Dow Chemical Corp., chair of the EIC, the group has a million dollars in research funding.

Another industry-backed organization, the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology (CIIT) in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, has just launched a three-year, $5 million research effort into how natural and synthetic chemicals affect the human hormone system. Cancer toxicology research — which traditionally took up two-thirds of its program — is now making way for the study of non-cancer effects such as neurotoxicity and endocrine effects. CIIT is funded by dues from about 40 member chemical companies including DuPont, Dow Chemical, Exxon Chemical, General Electric, and Hoechst Celanese. Not every major company is a member — BASF, Elf Atochem have never paid dues to CIIT — while other major players such as Amoco Chemical, BP America, Dow Corning, ICI Americas, Olin, and Rhone-Poulenc, have dropped out.

In addition to sponsoring and promoting potentially sympathetic scientific studies, the affected industries are investing heavily in public relations campaigns designed to challenge the growing anti-chemical lobby. In 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association formed the Chlorine Chemistry Council (CCC) in Washington, DC, which in turn hired the aggressive public relations firm Mongoven, Biscoe and Duchin (MBD) to target environmental groups. John Mongoven, co-founder of the DC-based firm, has taken up the issue personally and publishes a monthly briefing for his clients. His long-term strategy in countering those warning of the dangers of disrupter chemicals, says Montague of *Rachel's Weekly*, is to characterize the "phase out chlorine" position as "a rejection of accepted scientific method," as a violation of the chlorine industry's constitutional right to "have the liberty to do what they choose," and thus a threat to fundamental American values.

It is not the first time Mongoven has flacked for potentially deadly products. He began his PR career in 1981 when he was hired by the Nestlé Corp. to organize its response to a consumer boycott. Activists had charged that the company's infant formula marketing practices in the Third World encouraged poor women with no access to clean water to abandon breast-feeding and switch to expensive infant formula. Using dossiers that Mongoven compiled on the churches and other groups leading the boycott, Nestlé played on divisions and rivalries within the activist coalition to talk wavering "moderates" into abandoning the boycott.

MBD has often used similar strategies to neutralize activist groups on behalf of a variety of corporate clients. For example, after analyzing dioxin opposition, MBD picked the New York-based environmental group INFORM as a "moderate" group worth targeting for possible cooptation. This kind of tactic is an MBD specialty according to PR Watch editor John Stauber. He writes: "The field operatives who gather information for Mongoven, Biscoe & Duchin are typically polite, low-key and do their best to sound sympathetic to the people they are interrogating. They have misrepresented themselves, claiming falsely to be journalists, friends of friends, or supporters of social change. Most of the time, however, they simply give very limited information, identifying their company only by its initials and describing MBD euphemistically as a "research group" that helps "corporate decision makers... develop a better appreciation of the public interest movement" in order to "resolve contentious public policy issues in a balanced and socially responsible manner."

### Flacking for Secrecy
But perhaps the most far-reaching lobbying efforts are those directed at changing government regulations. In January, Ciba-Geigy's Crop Protection division met with the EPA's Office of Water and Office of Pesticide Programs to present its own studies on the health impact of the pesticide atrazine to counter evidence of health risks presented by the Washington-based Environmental Working Group.

Industry lobbying groups have also quietly begun to work with government to change the way that emissions of toxic chemicals are reported to the public. Traditionally, all emissions of chemicals listed as toxic by the government must be reported in a form that is accessible to the public. In the last three years, 18 states have voted in various versions of laws that allow companies to avoid telling authorities about such emissions if industry conducts systematic environmental audits internally. *The Wall Street Journal* says that the new laws "encourage companies to monitor their own activities rigorously without fear that what they discover will be used against them." The newspaper reports that these laws have been promoted by several industry lobby groups including the Compliance Management and Policy Group, the Corporate Environmental Enforcement Council, and the Coalition for Improved Environmental Audits.

One such law in Colorado allows companies to withhold information about air pollution. Another, under debate in Arizona, would implement the "broadest secrecy laws in the nation preventing the public from knowing what has actually happened at a facility," according to Felicia Marcus, regional administrator for the EPA.

### Lifestyle Changes
Even when health authorities and governments make a conscientious effort to set safety standards, they face considerable difficulties. One of the main problems is that the "safe" levels for chemicals in emissions and in everyday products such as pesticides have been traditionally based on their impact on adults, not children, who are at a far greater risk; the assumption is that it is mostly adults who use these products. But there is growing worry that the quantity of the chemical is largely irrelevant; the crucial question is not how much, but when exposure occurs. Thus one part in a million of a certain chemical may be perfectly safe during 99.99 percent of the life-cycle of a normal human being, but exposure to one part in a trillion at a particular time during pregnancy may cause a life-long tragedy.

Given this danger, some activists say the only way to prevent widespread sickness and disease is to question the current course of human "progress." Montague, who has been tracking the effects of synthetic chemicals on human health for 10 years, advocates questioning the use of all such substances. "The studies show that the strange new chemicals that govern our current patterns of lifestyle and consumption are killing us and making us sick," he says. "There is a clear pattern in our history that shows that every time we discover a dangerous chemical, we substitute it with a different one that we know very little about. We can't continue to do this. We have to stop using these chemicals and start living simpler lives."

Some institutions have already suggested that entire classes of chemicals be banned. Studies by the International Joint Commission, a scientific body set up to study water quality in the Great Lakes in Canada and the US, have shown that of the toxic substances found in the lakes, half of those that cause cancer and other health problems contain chlorine. As a result, the Commission recommended phasing out all chlorine-based chemicals. This conclusion was endorsed by the American Public Health Association.

While most scientists and government agencies are taking a "wait and see" approach, some local communities around the country are organizing to get answers for themselves. Last year a grassroots group of women in Marin County, California, a region that has the highest rate of breast cancer in the nation, decided to stop waiting for the medical community and commissioned its own research. The Marin Breast Cancer Watch is currently preparing a survey of the county to try to determine if environmental causes can explain the high cancer rates.

In Seattle, groups including the Women's Health Action Network and the Washington Toxics Coalition meet monthly to talk about issues of reproductive health and synthetic chemicals. Major environmental organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund and Greenpeace have also begun to lobby government and industry on these matters in national capitals.

While industry claims we don't know enough to justify action, many activists and researchers warn that if we wait for definitive answers, it may be too late. The cost of doing nothing will be illness and death for individuals, devastation of the environment, and serious genetic damage for many species, including humans. Many of the estimated 100,000 chemicals on the market today have not undergone rigorous testing and about 1,000 new ones are added every year. The burden of proof must shift so that the individual and combined impact of these chemicals is assessed and those that are not proven safe are banned. A phase-out period may be necessary to find natural substitutes and alternatives for substances already in use, but the ultimate goal must be a ban on such substances. In addition, no new chemicals should be introduced until complete testing is completed.

## The Business of Crimes and the Crimes of Business: Globalization and the Criminalization of Economic Activity
**"If you rob from many 100 percent there could be a moral offense. A few points more, a few points less Morality is a question of percent." - from The Secret, One Day by Raúl Salinas de Gotiari**

**by Michel Chossudovsky**

Every few weeks throughout 1993, a mysterious courier brought a cashier's check to the 16th floor glass-walled offices of Citibank's subsidiary in Mexico's capital. Following instructions, the clerks converted the pesos and wired $3-5 million to New York Citibank, which sent it on to Switzerland. In this way, Raúl Salinas de Gotiari, brother of then president of Mexico Carlos Salinas de Gotiari, transferred at least $100 million out of his country and into the secret, protected world of "private banking." After electronically landing in Switzerland, the money was shifted to untraceable Cayman Island shell accounts set up for Salinas. As is the norm for off-shore banking, these obfuscating corporations and accounts were created without disclosing the owners. Not normal, however, was the scandal that swirled around this high-profile case and the unusual amount of light it cast on the hidden world of private banking. Citibank, among Mexico's largest creditors, bore the legal onus of ensuring that it was not part of an illegal money laundering scheme. And even though Raúl drew a $190,000 annual salary (enormous in a country where the minimum wage is $3 a day), someone should have "asked questions." Salinas, now in prison, is charged with drug trafficking as well as masterminding the assassination of a rival. In 1993, according to the *New York Times*, he told investigators that Citibank officials in New York "came up with the whole strategy." Nor was that unusual, the report went on. The "details" of Raúl's accounts "were complex, but the basic principles for handling Mr. Salinas' money were straightforward, and designed to get his money to a safe haven without being traceable." Indeed, the same strategy is used daily around the globe to whisk fortunes, some made legally and some through crime, out of almost every country in the world and into secret accounts. In Mexico alone, in 1994, the year Carlos Salinas' six-year presidency ended, $20 billion — much of it collected through criminal activity — quietly slipped out of the country this way.

### No Questions Asked
In this vast world of private banking, "respectable" banks routinely blur the line between organized crime and organized capital by accepting dirty, covert, and black money and turning it all a clean, neutral green. Contrary to the Hollywood stereotypes and the sensationalism of investigative journalism, much of organized crime's activities do not imply a "break-down of law and order." In fact, the immense sums of money they handle are routinely concealed with great order and in accordance with laws designed precisely to protect the assets of the legally and illegally wealthy alike from the scrutiny of tax collectors and law enforcement agencies. Thus, while the misdeeds of "the petty criminal" are spotlighted by the press and police, the broader political and economic functions of international criminal organizations, operating as bona fide business entities in the global marketplace, are just part of the system.

At the top, the mafias have abandoned the black bag for the computer, the machine gun in the violin case for the stock portfolio in the briefcase. This shift from the blood-drenched fringe to polished wood boardroom has been facilitated by the global trend toward "economic liberalization," which has seen the downsizing of the state, the deregulation of international banking and trade, the privatization of state assets, etc. These conditions not only benefit transnational corporations which vigorously promote them, but favor the growth of illicit activities and the "internationalization" of the criminal economy as well. And indeed, the line between the two realms is often thinner than the stripe in a Saville Row suit.

### TNCs and TCOs
The profits of organized crime are vast and its influence wide on both local and global levels. The UN estimates the worldwide revenues of the "transnational criminal organizations" (now known as TCOs) at $1 trillion — about the same as the combined GDP of the group of low income countries (with a population of 3 billion people). The total includes trade in narcotics, arms sales, smuggling of nuclear materials, as well as earnings from the organized crime-controlled service economy such as prostitution, gambling, and currency exchange banks. What this figure does not convey is the magnitude of routine investments by criminal organizations in "legitimate" business undertakings, as well as their command over productive resources in many areas of the legal economy.

And just as corporations have increased their reach and influence by forming transnational entities that can evade control by individual nations, organized crime, too, has gone global. A new transnational relationship has emerged between the Chinese triads, the Japanese yakuza, and the European and US mafias. Rather than protecting their traditional turf, criminal organizations in different parts of the world have joined forces "in a spirit of global cooperation" geared toward "opening up new markets" in both the criminal and legal economies. According to one observer, "organized crime groups outperform most Fortune 500 companies... with organizations that resemble General Motors more than they resemble the traditional Sicilian mafia." In Russia, said FBI Criminal Division official Jim Moody, "the transition to capitalism provided new opportunities quickly exploited by criminal organizations [... which are] cooperating with other foreign criminal groups, including those based in Italy and Colombia."

In addition to cooperating with each other, criminal organizations routinely collaborate with legal business enterprises. By investing in a variety of "legitimate" undertakings they cannot only launder dirty money, but also accumulate wealth outside the criminal economy. The favored "legitimate" areas include prime real estate, the entertainment industry, publishing and the media, financial services. More recently, the mafias have invested in public utilities, manufacturing, and agriculture. In Japan, the three largest crime groups, the Yamaguchi-gumi, the Inagawa-kai, and the Sumi-yoshi-kai have "streamlined" their activities, moving from traditional money spinners such as drugs, prostitution, and gambling, into modern business undertakings. With the speculative boom of the 1980s, for example, the yakuza invested heavily in construction and urban property development. These ventures were funded through jusen (housing loan companies recently driven into bankruptcy by the collapse of Tokyo land values). Jusen in turn were backed by collateral loans from Japan's major commercial banks.

In Italy, the Cosa Nostra invests in both urban real estate and agricultural land. In Thailand, billions of dollars from the Golden Triangle heroin trade were recycled by Bangkok's business syndicates and secret societies toward investments in the textile industry. Hundreds of millions in Mexican drug money went to buy up state-owned industries during the wave of privatization initiated under Salinas. The Chinese triads channel money to the Hong Kong film industry and invest in industrial joint ventures in Guangdong and Fujian provinces and in the Shenzhen special economic zone. Annual worldwide earnings of the triads are estimated at $200 billion, more than 40 percent of mainland China's GDP.

### Criminalization of Politics
In order to thrive, criminal syndicates, like legitimate businesses, need friends in high places. In the new global financial environment, powerful undercover political lobbies connected to organized crime cultivate links to prominent political figures and senior government officials. This phenomenon is common not only in the emerging market economies, but also in the European Union, the US, and in Japan, where corruption has become rampant. In Europe's most blatant example, Italy, the entire political establishment has been permeated by the Cosa Nostra. In addition to the indictment of former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 3,000 state bureaucrats and corporate executives have been investigated or indicted on corruption charges.

In several Latin American countries, the drug cartels are tightly integrated into the state system and ruling parties. As a scandal around the Liberal Party of Colombia revealed, the Cali Cartel funneled sizeable contributions to the election campaign of President Ernesto Samper. In 1995, more than a dozen Colombian congressmembers, the Comptroller, the Attorney General, and the Defence Minister were indicted for accepting pay-offs from the Cali cartel. Similarly, the 1994 political killings in Mexico, including the alleged involvement of former President Carlos Salinas and his brother Raúl, have exposed the inside role of the Mexican drug cartels in the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). Drug lord Juan Garcia Abrego had as his patron the brother of the president. In Bolivia, since the mid-1980s, successive government coalitions under the protection of the party of Accíon Democrática Nacional (ADN), headed by former military dictator Gen. Hugo Banzer, were alleged to have ties to the drug trade.

In Venezuela, the narco-mafias had allegedly used the country's largest commercial bank, Banco Latino, to launder drug profits. Before its spectacular downfall along with 19 other Venezuelan banks in 1994, Banco Latino was controlled by the family of Pedro Tinoco, who was also head of the Central Bank under the government of President Carlos Andres Pérez (prosecuted on corruption charges). Tinoco was the main architect of Venezuela's structural adjustment program launched in 1988. In the words of one observer, "the drug cartels have created a symbiotic relationship between the economic and political structures." And there, as elsewhere around the world, such relationships positioned criminal organizations to exert decisive influence over macro-economic policy.

### Covert Money
One area of government which seems to have a special proclivity for trading favors with criminal organizations is intelligence. Since the end of World War II, Western intelligence agencies have developed a complex relationship with the illegal narcotics trade in particular. In case after case, drug money laundered in the international banking system has financed covert operations. In the Indochina war, according to historian Alfred W. McCoy, first France in the 1950s and later the US used the opium economy to fund Meo tribe mercenaries in Laos. In the 1960s, the Meo army was funded by the narcotics trade as part of Washington's military strategy against the combined forces of the neutralist government of Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Pathet Lao. Washington gave food aid to the Meo which facilitated a shift to opium cultivation: "With the rice from Air America and good opium prices from [the US-backed] Vang Pao's officers," wrote McCoy, "the farmers of Long Pot had chosen to emphasize opium cultivation."

The pattern of drug politics set in Indochina has been replicated in Central America and the Caribbean. "The rising curve of cocaine imports to the US," wrote journalist John Dinges, "followed almost exactly the flow of US arms and military advisers to Central America." The military in Guatemala and Haiti, to which the CIA provided covert support, were known to be involved in the trade of narcotics into Southern Florida. And as revealed in the Iran-Contra and Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) scandals, there is strong evidence that covert operations were funded through the laundering of drug money. "Dirty money" recycled through the banking system — often through an anonymous shell company — became "covert money," used to finance various rebel groups and guerrilla movements including the Nicaraguan Contras and the Afghan Mujahadeen.

Because the US wanted to supply the mujehadin rebels in Afghanistan with stinger missiles and other military hardware it needed the full cooperation of Pakistan. By the mid-1980s, the CIA operation in Islamabad was one of the largest US intelligence stations in the World. "If BCCI is such an embarrassment to the US that forthright investigations are not being pursued it has a lot to do with the blind eye the US turned to the heroin trafficking in Pakistan," said a US intelligence officer.

### Recycling Dirty Money
Most of the profits reaped by criminal organizations, however, are cycled through the perfectly ordinary channels favored by their legitimate counterparts. The money goes into commercial banks, which use it to expand their lending activities to both the legal and criminal economies. Dirty and covert money is also funneled to "respectable" investments such as derivatives, primary commodities, stocks, and government bonds. In many countries, it is through these bonds that criminal organizations, holding big chunks of public debt, influence government economic policy.

With so much in common, it is not surprising that the same global financial system which favors legal corporations and banks also serves criminal organizations. Regulations which foster capital flight to offshore havens help not only wealthy individuals move "black money" (money which has evaded tax authorities), but also help criminal syndicates to transport dirty money. And in both cases, the banks make out like bandits by exacting hefty commissions on the transactions. The commercial banks also profit by lending great sums to the criminal syndicates. These infusions of capital support the expansion of the criminal economy as well as the penetration of the legal economy by organized crime. The mafias in turn pump sizeable investments into commercial banks, some of which they control, and into brokerage and law firms which can prove useful as well as profitable. Scholar Jonathan Harris conservatively estimates that the US banking system launders $100 billion a year for organized crime using some of America's largest commercial banks. Another study points to the role of New York's large investment houses, as well as Wall Street's bullion and foreign exchange dealers in the laundering of drug money.

While there have been numerous documented cases of money laundering, very few banks have been prosecuted and criminal indictments are invariably limited to local level bank employees. In a 1994 court settlement in Houston, Texas, for instance, American Express Bank International (AEBI) was fined $7 million and forfeited more than $25 million to settle money-laundering charges. The case against AEBI grew out of criminal charges brought against two bank directors working in Beverly Hills, California, who were convicted of ... moving funds through American Express accounts controlled by holding companies created in the Cayman Islands. To obtain the settlement, federal officials agreed to forego a criminal indictment of AEBI. "We decided that the criminal activity was not pervasive through the entire company," says Assistant U.S. Attorney David Novak. "It was limited to one branch office."

### Offshore Banking Havens
Almost all roads in this tangled financial network lead offshore to the banking havens. Without the cumbersome smuggling of banknotes across international borders, they move and conceal the proceeds of illicit trade through a web of offshore hideaways and a maze of anonymous shell companies. It is here that the criminal syndicates and the representatives of the world's largest commercial banks interact. Here, criminal organizations take advantage of services offered, and of the advances in telecommunications and banking technologies. Nothing could be easier; now offshore accounts can be accessed through an automatic teller machine anywhere in the world with a VISA card and funds can be transferred instantaneously and transformed into cash.

The same privacy, technology, and lack of regulation that attract the criminals help legal money flow between a parent company and its subsidiary shell corporation. In Luxembourg, the British Channel Islands, the Cayman Islands, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands, and about 50 other locations around the globe, many of the world's major banks set up private banking affiliates that offer "discrete and personalized service" for the establishment of "tax efficient" accounts. But despite often exotic locations, these offshore havens are by-and-large appendages of the Western banking system. The Caribbean havens, for example, were set up under British banking legislation with technical advice from Western banks. Called "carbon copies of each other," they are based on British laws that ensure total privacy and set criminal penalties for bank employees who disclose confidential corporate or banking information. In the sleazy upside down environment of offshore banking, the assets of criminal organizations are protected by the criminal code.

And under this protection they have flourished. The magnitude of offshore banking is overwhelming and ultimately unknown since much of the money deposited is unreported. The US investment bank, Merrill Lynch, conservatively estimates the wealth of private individuals managed through private banking accounts in offshore tax havens at $3.3 trillion. The IMF puts the offshore assets of corporations and individuals at $5.5 trillion, a sum equivalent to 25 percent of total world income. The largely ill-gotten loot of Third World elites in numbered accounts is placed at $600 billion, with one-third of that held in Switzerland.

But although Switzerland remains the traditional favorite, with more than 40 percent of offshore wealth stashed away in its non-resident bank accounts, it has plenty of competitors for both legal and illegal wealth. The tiny Cayman Islands — with more banks and registered trust companies than people — is the fifth largest banking center in the world. Jersey, only one of the tax-sheltering British Channel Islands off the Normandy coast, has $140 billion in bank deposits. The Cook Islands, Bermuda, and Cayman are approved by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission for the incorporation of companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In the British Virgin Islands, which falls under UK legal jurisdiction, there are 130,000 registered "international business companies" protected by complete confidentiality and anonymity.

Not only bankers, but also currency dealers and institutional fund managers handling pension funds and mutual funds use offshore facilities. With the deregulation that marked the 1980s, the Caribbean centers came to play a major role in Euro-currency dealings through registered subsidiaries of US banks. The large insurance companies use their "offshore umbrellas" to help corporations establish "captive subsidiaries" which receive insurance premiums "to cover the parent's risk exposure." Corporations and criminals alike use them to "recycle their profits" to a variety of business activities including high risk investments and "hot money deposits" in the peripheral stock markets of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. In this way, "black" and "dirty" money are routinely transformed into "hot" money, which largely consists of highly speculative short-term deposits — often managed by the large institutional investors.

The effect of these offshore havens is massive tax evasion, vast corporate cash reserves in the form of tax-free black money, and a level of capital flight that leaves already teetering and debt-ridden national economies devastated and unable to function. This critical drain of billions of dollars in capital flight dramatically reduces state tax revenues, paralyzes social programs, drives up budget deficits, and spurs the accumulation of large public debts.

### Global Debt, Drugs, and Economic Medicine
The role of illicit trade and money laundering in exacerbating the problems of national debt is particularly strong. The plunge in world commodity prices and the resulting debt crisis of the early 1980s contributed to decimating export revenues in developing countries. Then, as debt mounted further, international creditors imposed harsh austerity measures such as laying off public employees, auctioning state industry, freezing public investment, and curtailing credit to farmers and industrialists. The resultant rampant unemployment and fall of real wages sent the "legal economy" into crisis.

The simultaneous collapse of exports and domestic markets created a vacuum in the economic system which allowed a dramatic expansion of the underground economy. In many countries, illicit production became the leading sector of the economy, the main source of foreign exchange, and fertile ground for the criminal mafias. In Bolivia, the IMF-sponsored New Economic Policy (NEP), first adopted in 1985, contributed to the demise of mineral exports and to massive lay-offs by the state mining consortium COMIBOL. With no jobs in sight, fired miners used their severance pay to invest in the coca producing areas, thereby boosting the narcotics trade.

Similarly, the "economic stabilization" and structural adjustment program in Peru under President Alberto Fujimori wreaked economic and social havoc. The August 1990 "Fujishock" — which included a 30-fold increase in fuel prices from one day to the next — drove farmers who had been scraping by with low-profit crops such as coffee, maize, and tobacco to switch to coca cultivation. According to the UN, "syndicate inroads were facilitated by the structural adjustment programs which debt-ridden countries were obliged to accept in order to receive loans from the International Monetary Fund."

The strong correlation between debt pressures and an increase in organized criminal activity is not limited to the Latin American and Asian drug triangles. In Africa, when trade barriers were lifted and European and US grain surpluses were dumped on the domestic market, local agricultural production plummeted. As food self-sufficiency declined and external debt rose, many farmers started growing cannabis. In Morocco, foreign exchange from hashish (kif) cultivation now equals the combined earnings of all the country's legal agricultural exports. In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa farmers are moving into ganja, a local variety of marijuana with excellent export potential. In several African countries, the drug mafias have also made significant inroads into local politics.

The pattern repeats in the former Soviet bloc. The "strong economic medicine" imposed by external creditors has contributed to an extensive criminal economy which feeds on poverty and economic dislocation. In the Ukraine, for instance, the IMF-sponsored "shock treatment" applied in October 1994 wreaked havoc: The price of bread increased overnight by 300 percent, electricity prices by 600 percent, and public transportation by 900 percent. Combined with the lifting of subsidies and the freeze on credit, the reforms have contributed to undermining Ukraine's breadbasket economy. With trade liberalization, the door has also been opened to the dumping of US grain surpluses and "food aid" on the domestic market, contributing to destabilizing one of the world's largest and most productive wheat economies. The Paris-based Geopolitical Drug Watch confirmed that as wheat production in the Ukraine fell, illegal opium cultivation increased rapidly. The dynamic is the same in the former Yugoslavia, where local agriculture is being supplanted by poppy cultivation and heroin manufacture controlled by the Italian Sacro Corona Unita mafia.

As countries fall deeper in debt and legal industries and agriculture collapse under the brunt of the structural adjustment programs, annual interest payments can exceed total legal export earnings. Under these circumstances, income from illicit trade is the only available source of essential foreign exchange, and creditors and debtors alike share a vested financial interest in the uninterrupted flow of lucrative contraband. In Latin America's "narco-democracies," as well as in Pakistan, they cooperate to recycle billions of "narco-dollars" through the banking system to meet the demands of creditors.

In the early 1990s in Peru, the Central Bank, through informal exchange dealers operating on street corners in downtown Lima, purchased an average of 8 million narco-dollars a day. This money had been earmarked for the servicing of Peru's external debt.

Latin American governments also used revenues from the drug economy to buy arms and to prop up their military establishments. In several countries, factions within the military have connections to the drug trade. In a curious irony, according to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), "US narcotics efforts have the harmful side effect of forging even closer US ties with abusive police and military forces."

### Privatization Programs Playing Favorites
Many Western and Japanese commercial banks stepped into openings created by the privatization and debt restructuring programs to pick up state assets and public land "at a good price." They have also scooped up state banks in Latin America and Eastern Europe, many of which were known to be involved in the laundering of dirty money. In Hungary, for instance, the Central European International Bank (CIB) was acquired by a consortium of foreign banks including Banca Comerciale Italiana, Bayerische Vereingsbank A. G., the Long-term Credit Bank of Japan, the Sakura Bank, and the Société Générale. CIB has full freedom to enter the lucrative business of moving money back and forth without government interference or compliance with foreign exchange rules. A 1992 court case in Luxembourg confirmed that the Cali Cartel used CIB to transfer money. In the words of the Hungarian Drug Brigade, "with this country's economic problems and need for liquid assets, one cannot ask the government to look too hard at the origin of the money deposited in her banks."

In Bolivia and Peru, IMF-guided reforms to the banking system have facilitated a free flow of currency in and out of the country. Said one observer, "This amounts to nothing less than the legalization of money laundering by the Peruvian financial system." And indeed, given the devastated above-ground economy, the laundering of drug money is probably what made Peruvian banks profitable in the first place.

In Latin America, many of the privatized state banks are now under the control of European and US banking interests. An example is the case of Interbanc, a Peruvian State bank acquired in 1994 by Darby Overseas, a company owned by Nicholas Brady, former treasury secretary under the Bush administration. According to the Financial Times, Darby Overseas "is to invest in Peru's commercial banking sector, rated a high risk while it awaits a Brady plan to reschedule its debt.... Darby Overseas was set up a year ago [1993] by Mr. Brady, his chief aide at the Treasury Mr. Hollis McLoughlin, and Mr. Daniel Marx, [former] Argentine finance under-secretary.... The prime mover behind IFH, constituted to bid for Interbanc, is Mr. Carlos Pastor, Peru's economy minister in the early 1980s."

In Russia, the privatization programs have unequivocally favored the transfer of a significant slice of state property to organized crime. Not surprisingly, the Russian mafias, which constitute a new property-owning class, have championed the "free market" and fervently supported President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms. They have also backed his July 1996 re-election campaign. They, along with the former Soviet nomenklatura, have moved billions of dollars in "black" and "dirty money" to offshore hideaways. Some of that money has returned to Russia to buy state enterprises and public land. Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands are respectively ranked third and fourth among Russia's "foreign investors." Not only are the Russian mafias involved, but Western criminal organizations — often through an institutional investor — have channeled money toward the "emerging financial markets" in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where the shares of privatized state enterprises have been put on the auction block.

With a grip on politicians and state officials and their representatives in the legislature, the more than 1,300 organized criminal groups in the Russian Federation have the clout to impose "democracy" and shape economic policy to their advantage. They also wield considerable financial influence. According to a recently published study by the Russian Academy of Sciences, organized crime controls more than 40 percent of the Russian economy, half of Moscow's commercial real estate, two-thirds of commercial institutions; in total some 35,000 businesses, nearly 400 banks, and 150 government-owned enterprises. A section of the Russian syndicates is also involved in sales of nuclear, space, and defense-related material, including guided missiles and plutonium for bombs and conventional weaponry.

### Lies and Consequences
Global crime has become an integral part of an economic system, with far reaching social, economic, and geopolitical ramifications. The proceeds of the criminal economy are used to repay international creditors; legal and illegal undertakings are increasingly intertwined, the dividing line between "businesspeople" and criminals is blurred.

In turn, the relationship among criminals, politicians, and members of the intelligence establishment has tainted the structures of the state and the role of its institutions. Capital flight, massive tax evasion and money laundering, sanctioned by the global market system, are among the main causes of public debt and rising budget deficits. The criminalization of the banking system drains resources from the production of necessary consumer goods and channels capital toward a skewed luxury goods economy (e.g., high-income services, resort hotels, real estate, etc.) which serves the interests of a wealthy minority.

Meanwhile, the international financial community turns a blind eye until some scandal momentarily breaks through the gilded surface. They see money laundering and the acquisition of state property by organized crime under the privatization programs as lesser evils that help governments pay their external debt. In turn, the offshore banks rake in profits as they discreetly tout the advantages of "asset protection" and fail to discriminate between clean and dirty money. Banking institutions with links to organized crime or money laundering operations "create" clean money from the profits on deposits of dirty money. They then use the laundered funds to control real and financial resources. By recycling their criminal money to the legal economy, known criminals become renowned corporate executives and financiers.

This system of global trade and finance has fostered an unprecedented accumulation of private wealth alongside the impoverishment of large sectors of the world population, and prospects for change are dim. Big business and criminal organizations operating at a world level share the same regulatory environment. Laws which protect the former also protect the latter. The banking system allows corporations, wealthy individuals, and criminals to conceal their wealth. Under the motto "no questions asked," banks plead ignorance and boast good faith while shielding organized crime and organized capital alike from public inquiry and prosecution. Major international commercial banks not only constitute an outlet for money laundering for which they exact commission fees, they also provide credit at high rates of interest to the criminal mafia, often to the detriment of legal agriculture and manufacturing.

Vested interests are so entrenched in this system that formal changes in the gamut of banking regulations are unlikely to effect fundamental reform. The ability — and the will — of governments and of international institutions to curb the criminal economy on behalf of society is seriously compromised since those with the power to make changes are often well-served by the status quo. In the words of a UN report, "international law enforcement is at best a holding action. ... [U]nless there is simultaneous advance in economic and social development, organized crime on a pervasive and global scale is likely to be with us to stay."

## The Uses of "Counter-Terrorism": Bush Takes Charge
**A paper trail of declassified documents from the Reagan-Bush era yields valuable information on how counter-terrorism provided a powerful mechanism for solidifying Bush's power base and launching a broad range of national security initiatives.**

**by Christopher Simpson**

During the Reagan years, George Bush used "crisis management" and "counter-terrorism" as vehicles for running key parts of the clandestine side of the US government. Bush proved especially adept at plausible denial. Some measure of his skill in avoiding responsibility can be taken from the fact that even after the Iran-Contra affair blew the Reagan administration apart, Bush went on to become the "foreign policy president," while CIA Director William Casey, by then conveniently dead, took most of the blame for a number of covert foreign policy debacles that Bush had set in motion.

The trail of National Security Decision Directives (NSDDs) left by the Reagan administration begins to tell the story. True, much remains classified, and still more was never committed to paper in the first place. Even so, the main picture is clear: As vice president, George Bush was at the center of secret wars, political murders, and America's convoluted oil politics in the Middle East.

The Reagan-era National Security Council (NSC) used NSDDs to formulate high-level policy on political and military matters. The directives ranged from presidential orders for testing nuclear weapons to negotiating strategies for US representatives at various international summits. Reagan and the NSC also used NSDDs to settle conflicts among security agencies over bureaucratic turf and lines of command. It is through that prism that we see the first glimmers of Vice President Bush's role in clandestine operations during the 1980s.

### NSDD 3 CRISIS MANAGEMENT
(CONFIDENTIAL, SANITIZED VERSION), DEC. 14, 1981

When the Reagan administration began, Secretary of State Alexander Haig tried to write a large "crisis management" role for himself into draft presidential orders. Bush and NSC Adviser Richard Allen blocked the maneuver. After Reagan was wounded in an assassination attempt in early 1981, Bush engineered NSC approval for an inter-agency crisis management committee that reported to him. The working assumption was that Reagan would leave the difficult decisions to Bush and the NSC, which would assume de facto presidential powers during a crisis, including the authority to wage war or to declare martial law. Haig, who was on the NSC, later wrote that he first learned of the vice president's move from a newspaper report. The Crisis Management Group was the first of a series of names for a senior deputies' committee through which the vice president handled crisis management, covert operations, and particularly sensitive foreign policy initiatives. Later names for substantially the same committee included the Special Situations Group, Crisis Pre-Planning Group, Planning and Coordinating Group, and the Policy Review Group.

### NSDD 30. MANAGING TERRORIST INCIDENTS, APRIL 10, 1982

During the Reagan-Bush years, "terrorism" was a label that could be applied to tactics of almost any opposition group who would not play by White House rules. By taking on administrative responsibility for dealing with terrorism, Bush extended his administrative turf to include almost every aspect of clandestine security policy.

### NSDD 138. PREEMPTIVE STRIKES AGAINST SUSPECTED TERRORISTS,
(DECLASSIFIED FRAGMENT; CLASSIFICATION LEVEL OF ORIGINAL TEXT NOT DISCLOSED), POSSIBLE DATE APRIL 3, 1984

On March 16, 1984, Islamic guerrillas kidnapped William Buckley, CIA chief of station in Beirut. One result was presidential authorization of NSDD 138, a de facto US declaration of war against Islamic guerrilla groups in the Middle East and Northern Africa.

The still-classified portions of the directive authorized establishing secret FBI and CIA paramilitary squads and use of existing Pentagon military units such as the Green Berets and Navy SEALs for conducting what amounted to guerrilla war against guerrillas. It authorized sabotage, killing (though not "assassination"), preemptive and retaliatory raids, deception, and a significantly expanded intelligence collection program aimed at suspected radicals and people regarded as sympathizers. ("Assassination," in CIA parlance, referred to the murder of heads of state and was barred by a presidential order first issued during the Ford administration. Killing suspected guerrillas and lower-level state officials, in contrast, was regarded as "preemptive self-defense.") The order placed special stress on campaigns against Iran, Libya, Syria, Cuba, Nicaragua, North Korea, and the USSR. The NSC has thus far released only a one-page "extract" of sentences from this original order. Other portions of the directive, however, were made public in the form of a Presidential Message to Congress and associated statements to the media.

### U.S. POLICY ON THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, MAY-JUNE 1984?
USE OF U.S. MILITARY TO KEEP THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ OPEN TO OIL TANKER TRAFFIC, MAY-JUNE 1984?

An unnamed "senior [Reagan] administration official" revealed the existence of these presidential directives to the *Washington Post* during a 1987 interview, when they were cited as the basis for the administration's decision to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz during the Iran-Iraq war.

The US "tilted" toward Iraq in its war with Iran. It prepared contingency plans for aiding Iraq and other Persian Gulf states in a confrontation with Iran or uprising by domestic Islamic militants. In a broader sense, the two directives set the stage for the Bush administration's transfer of military equipment and satellite intelligence to Iraq prior to its invasion of Kuwait.

### LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR CLANDESTINE KILLING TEAMS, NOV. 13, 1984

Shortly after President Reagan's landslide reelection victory, CIA Director William Casey met with the president in the White House to convince him to authorize intelligence findings and a directive to implement the anti-guerrilla campaign outlined in NSDD 138. Casey's draft NSDD was designed to provide legal guarantees to US field officers and foreign strike teams that would protect them from punishment for activities that would otherwise violate US law or the Executive Order that nominally bars US agencies from participating in assassinations. White House officials later called this new directive "a license to kill" and a "go anywhere, do anything" authority to combat guerrillas viewed as hostile to the US.

The directive indicated that actions taken "in good faith" by US agents conducting authorized anti-guerrilla operations "must be and are deemed" lawful. The ambiguous wording insisted on legal acts, yet paradoxically "deemed" anti-terrorist acts to be legal in advance. The first "pre-emptive self defense" teams were to be created in Lebanon, then expand into other countries with an initial budget of about $1 million.

The accompanying intelligence findings approved CIA and US military programs to recruit and train clandestine death squads in about a dozen countries, including Lebanon and Honduras. In at least one case, a US-sponsored Lebanese Christian militia killing squad undertook what was later described as an "unauthorized" bombing aimed at an Islamic fundamentalist religious leader linked to the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut. On March 8, 1985, the Lebanese killing team bombed the apartment building of Islamic fundamentalist Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, killing 80 and wounding 256, many of whom were schoolchildren from a nearby academy. Fadlallah was not injured. After considerable publicity, White House officials told the *Washington Post* that the NSC had approved creation of the Lebanese team, but that the bombing was unauthorized. The CIA was said to have "rescinded" the project after the bombing.

### NSDD 159. MANAGEMENT OF U.S. COVERT OPERATIONS, (TOP SECRET/VEIL - SENSITIVE), JAN. 18, 1985

The Reagan administration's commitment to significantly expand covert operations had been clear since before the 1980 election. How such operations were actually to be managed from day to day, however, was considerably less certain. The management problem became particularly knotty owing to legal requirements to notify congressional intelligence oversight committees of covert operations, on the one hand, and the tacitly accepted presidential mandate to deceive those same committees concerning sensitive operations such as the Contra war in Nicaragua, on the other.

The solution attempted in NSDD 159 was to establish a small coordinating committee headed by Vice President George Bush through which all information concerning US covert operations was to be funneled. The order also established a category of top secret information known as Veil, to be used exclusively for managing records pertaining to covert operations. The system was designed to keep circulation of written records to an absolute minimum while at the same time ensuring that the vice president retained the ability to coordinate US covert operations with the administration's overt diplomacy and propaganda.

Only eight copies of NSDD 159 were created. The existence of the vice president's committee was itself highly classified. The directive became public as a result of the criminal prosecutions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, and others involved in the Iran-Contra affair, hence the designation "Exhibit A" running up the left side of the document.

### U.S. STRATEGY FOR IRAN AFTER KHOMEINI, JUNE 1985 (NOT OFFICIALLY ADOPTED, TOP SECRET) AND COVERT ACTION FINDING REGARDING IRAN, (TOP SECRET), JAN. 17, 1986

This draft NSDD, drawn up primarily by NSC staffer Howard Teicher, illustrated the political splits within the Reagan NSC that eventually gave rise to the Iran-Contra crisis. According to the Tower Commission report, Teicher synthesized this draft order from a Special National Intelligence Estimate on Iran and a CIA study of potential covert operations against the Khomeini government. The draft authorized "the supply of Western military hardware" to Iran and other measures, according to its cover memo." George Shultz and Caspar Weinberger disapproved, however, killing the draft order. Nevertheless, George Bush, William Casey, and key members of the appropriately named Crisis Pre-Planning Group continued to support the initiative, and secretly implemented it over the next two years.

In January 1986, NSC staffer Oliver North drew up a formal Covert Action Finding for President Reagan. It authorized the CIA and NSC staff to proceed with the controversial effort to transfer US weapons to Iranian "moderates" in exchange for their cooperation in freeing US hostages in Lebanon. In effect, the finding implemented the program that had been outlined in the rejected NSDD, but without the approval of Shultz, Weinberger, and congressional intelligence committees. The handwriting at the bottom includes Reagan's initials and a note by security adviser Poindexter indicating that the "President was verbally briefed from this paper. VP [Vice President Bush], Don Regan [presidential chief of staff] and Don Fortier [Poindexter's deputy and focal point for covert operations on Bush's Planning and Coordinating Group] were present." In later testimony, President Reagan insisted that he had not understood the content of the North/Poindexter Finding memo at the time he approved it.

### NSDD 179. TASK FORCE ON COMBATTING TERRORISM, (CONFIDENTIAL), JULY 20, 1985

In June 1985, Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas hijacked TWA Flight 847, took more than 150 hostages, and began a highly publicized, 17-day series of negotiations with US officials. Despite a public commitment from President Reagan that "America will never make concessions to terrorists," the confrontation ended with an agreement by the US and Israel to release hundreds of Lebanese Shiite prisoners in exchange for the TWA passengers.

The existing US policy of preemptive strikes against suspected terrorists (NSDD 138) had not been properly implemented because of sluggish bureaucracies in the US and indecision among US allies, at least as Reagan, Shultz, Casey, and other prominent officials saw things. This directive again appointed Bush to serve as the administration's coordinator for all major decisions concerning "terrorism," and to develop strategy and tactics for "preemptive or retaliatory actions to combat terrorism" that could garner international support. This order was classified "Confidential," indicating that it was designed for circulation throughout the government.

### NSDD 207. NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR COMBATTING TERRORISM, (TOP SECRET), JAN. 20, 1986

This nine-page directive was the "comprehensive presidential statement of US counter-terrorism policy" in effect during both the Reagan and Bush administrations, according to an NSC deposition filed in US District Court. It formalized the recommendations of Vice President Bush's Task Force on Combatting Terrorism (NSDD 179). Washington's announced policy, both in public forums and in classified orders such as this one, was that the US government would make "no concessions [to guerrillas]... pay no ransoms, nor permit release of prisoners or agree to other conditions that could serve to encourage additional terrorism."

In fact, of course, President Reagan, VP Bush, and others had already engineered a series of concessions to secure release of hostages in what would come to be called the Iran-Contra affair. From the standpoint of broad policy, this directive covered much of the same ground as NSDD 138, signed the previous April. In addition to the "no concessions" pledge, the US government asserted that it would "take measures to protect our citizens" (preemptive action); "make every legal effort to prosecute terrorists" (later acknowledged to include seizure of foreign nationals abroad for prosecution in the US); pay substantial rewards for information concerning guerrilla activity; and ensure that states that support anti-US guerrillas "will not be allowed to do so without consequence."

NSDD 207's innovation lay in its new administrative measures to implement the broad policies. It created an Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program within the government, ordered new restrictions on the Freedom of Information Act, and renewed efforts to pass new emergency powers legislation developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which would authorize declaration of martial law in the US during "emergencies" announced by the president.

The directive authorized creation of a "proposed organization" within the US government specializing in anti-guerrilla intelligence gathering, paramilitary operations, and rescue techniques. The existence, budget, tactics, leaders, and personnel of the group were intended to remain classified. Other measures included: authorization of an FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service campaign to review the immigration status of political suspects in the US; preparation of legal arguments designed to justify various US responses to guerrillas, including use of deadly force and unilateral military operations abroad; and creation of specialized tactics, equipment, and squads of trained paramilitary operatives useful for striking at guerrilla targets.

### NSDD. PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE AGAINST LIBYA, (CLASSIFIED, NO TEXT AVAILABLE), AUG. 14, 1986

On August 6, 1986, senior State Department and CIA political officers drew up orders for a clandestine campaign to encourage a "coup or assassination attempt" against Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi. Bush, Shultz, Casey, and Poindexter supported the plan in NSC meetings, contending that even if a coup attempt failed, the resulting confusion would sew mistrust within Libya and keep Qaddafi off balance. The president signed the order on August 14.

The campaign had at least three main parts. First, the US used previously scheduled, joint US-Egyptian military exercises to position warships off the Libyan coast. Second, the CIA, NSC, and State Department meanwhile spread rumors through the media that a new US "confrontation" with Libya was imminent, perhaps involving attacks on the seacoast and along the contested Libya-Chad border to the south. The CIA, meanwhile, stepped up covert operations designed to encourage Libyan exiles and dissidents in the military to strike against Qaddafi, while the NSC dispatched US Ambassador Vernon Walters to Europe and Japan on a mission that was to be described in intentional leaks to the press as an effort to drum up international support for the coming "confrontation."

Although the covert operations among Libyan exiles were real enough, the NSC sought to spur a coup against Qaddafi, not invade the country. The CIA and NSC systematically leaked false information to sympathetic reporters abroad and in the US, claiming among other things that the Libyan leader had become sexually impotent and was "off his rocker." Much of the disinformation was reported as fact by television, major newspapers, and even supermarket tabloids.

The psychological warfare campaign dramatically self-destructed a about a month later. On October 2, the *Washington Post* reported many of the details of the NSC effort against Qaddafi, including the false stories planted in the *Wall Street Journal* and *New York Times*. The resulting loss of media support was to cost the administration dearly a few months later when new information surfaced about US covert operations in Nicaragua and arms trade with Iran.

### NSDD 286. ADMINISTRATION OF U.S. CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS IN THE WAKE OF IRAN-CONTRA REVELATIONS, (SANITIZED VERSION – ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION NOT DISCLOSED), LATE OCTOBER - EARLY NOVEMBER 1987

This directive, together with NSDD 266 and NSDD 276, sketched out the purported reforms in NSC procedure for management of clandestine operations adopted in the wake of the Iran-Contra and Libyan debacles and the growing realization that President Reagan had become mentally incapacitated. The declassified version of the new procedures required somewhat more rigorous documentation of presidential approval of "special activities" (covert operations) and barred the NSC staff from the "conduct" (but not the management) of special activities.

Beyond that, though, there was little change in the management or the content of US clandestine operations. Some experts contended that NSDD 286 effectively weakened congressional oversight of US covert operations by opening a new loophole that exempted special activities from existing reporting requirements during unspecified "extraordinary circumstances."

## Government, Media, and Burning Black Churches: Ashes of Racism, Fires of Terror
**The smoke from the scores of black churches torched in the last few years lays a haze of racism across the country. Investigators and the media have ignored a context of centuries-long racism and an atmosphere of terror.**

**by Ron Nixon**

The 1994 World Trade Center bombing, the bombings at the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 and Atlanta's Centennial Park during the 1996 Olympics, as well as the crash of TWA flight 800, focused public fear on the vulnerability of the US to terrorist attacks. These tragedies sparked intensive investigations and provoked often strident calls for countermeasures. Although some of the assaults were attributed to foreign fanatics, others brought home the reality that America is capable of producing its own violent extremists.

For many, particularly media pundits, these attacks signal the end of American insouciance: Terrorism has finally penetrated US borders. Yet strangely absent in the public discourse on the perceived upsurge in domestic terrorism is a long pattern of attacks against abortion providers and the recent targeting of a central organization, especially in the South, for much of black culture, political organizing, and life — the church. According to the Atlanta watchdog group, the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), more than 80 black churches have been burned or desecrated since 1990. From January 1995 through July 1996, at least 42 have been set on fire. While politicians have paid lip service and passed what many church leaders feel is a meaningless bill to raise the penalty for burning a house of worship, they have refused to classify these attacks as acts of terrorism or even as racially motivated. In a national radio address and in a two-hour meeting with ministers from a number of black churches, President Clinton said that the fires are the result of "racial hostility," but stopped short of calling the burnings acts of terrorism.

"The problem with the Clinton administration is that they have yet to say to the nation that this is domestic terrorism and they will not tolerate it," said CDR's research director, Rose Johnson. "Until such time as that comes out of the administration's mouth, I think the nation knows that they're not serious. [The burning of churches] is terrorism by the administration's own definition and it must take a stand."

### Terrorism? What Terrorism?
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), domestic terrorism is the "unlawful use of force or terror against persons or property to intimidate or coerce the government, civilian population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives." Under this definition, at least some of the church fires could be classified as acts of terrorism. Consider the following:

* South Carolina, June 1995. Two white men were convicted of burning two black churches and stabbing a mentally ill black man. Both culprits, Christopher Cox and Timothy Welch, were members of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Police confirmed that they attended a Klan meeting shortly before the burnings at which the speaker stated that black churches instruct African Americans on how to get on welfare. Several days later Herbert Rowell, a Klansman who had attended the meeting and was a friend of the two suspects, asked reporters, "Have you ever noticed that when there's free cheese or milk and stuff? We [whites] don't know about it, but they [blacks] are the first in line." Cox and Welch also had contact with another Klansman, Arthur Haley, whose home was raided by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agents. Guns and Klan paraphernalia were confiscated. The pastor of one of the churches burned by Cox and Welch was threatened after the two were arrested and later charged with conspiracy to violate civil rights. According to the minister, he was approached by an unidentified man who said, "I'm going to get you nigger,"
* Bowling Green, Kentucky, 1993. Ernest Pierce, state leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and three others were indicted and prosecuted on federal charges for the December 1991 burning of Barren River Baptist Church. Court records show that five days after the church fire, Pierce came to a Klan meeting, threw down a newspaper with coverage of the fire, and congratulated members on a job well done. After a KKK march, the minister of the church had openly criticized Pierce and the Klan. In court, Pierce testified that he torched the church in retaliation for the criticism.
* Southeastern Arkansas, May 17, 1992. Three black churches in Oak Grove and St. James in Desha County, and Love Rest Baptist Church in Arkansas County, were burned by two white males, Kenneth A. Coates and Perry Moore, both age 23. According to Assistant US Attorney Michael D. Johnson, the two men wanted to "get African Americans." Moore and Coates pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burn the churches.
* Clarksville, Tennessee, 1995. Shortly after what the Justice Department called a "racially motivated arson spree," a church was burned. During the spree, molotov cocktails had been thrown at the home of an African American family while they were asleep. A Nashville, Tennessee man convicted on federal charges for the string of fires is serving eight years in prison. The man belonged to a white supremacist group, the Aryan Faction, dedicated to driving blacks out of Clarksville. No one has been arrested in the burning of the church.

These attacks, and many others that followed, share a similar profile: They are racially inspired and are usually preceded by years of intimidation by hate groups and individuals. Nonetheless, federal investigators do not see them as terrorism and rarely acknowledge that they are racially motivated. At the top, Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have pledged all available resources toward finding the culprits in the church fires. On the local level, however, FBI and ATF agents aren't as enthusiastic. Says FBI agent Jim Brown with the agency's Birmingham, Alabama office, "Just because you have white people burning black churches doesn't mean that it's racially motivated or domestic terrorism." FBI head Louis Freeh, who recently testified at a congressional hearing on the terrorism in Atlanta and possibly in the TWA crash, has yet to issue a statement on the church fires. Nor did he testify at the congressional hearings on the subject held in May.

### Shifting the Blame
When law enforcement and the media failed to find an organized conspiracy behind the church fires, they sought to characterize the incidents as politically as well as geographically isolated. If the attacks are not linked through a cabal of individuals or organizations, they seemed to be saying, they can have no connection to each other at all. Instead of seeing the arson as a natural byproduct of a pervasive atmosphere of racism, scapegoating, and official neglect, many reports discredited charges of racism or terrorism. In this backlash, the media juggled statistics and focused on the small number of blacks arrested in connection with the church fires.

The Associated Press weighed in with a July 5, 1996 article that hit the front page of newspapers nationwide. Based on interviews with law enforcement officials, insurance companies, and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) which tracks church fires, AP concluded that charges of racism or domestic terrorism were unfounded. "There is no evidence that most of the 73 black church fires recorded since 1995 can be blamed on a conspiracy or a climate of racial hatred," wrote AP reporter Fred Bayles. "There's a lot of feeling out there that these fires are copycat fires," says Richard Gilman of the Insurance Committee for Arson Control, a trade group that uses insurance data to track fires.

Using similar data, *New Yorker* writer Michael Kelly also discounted racism and domestic terror as a motive for the burning of black churches — blaming instead the CDR for causing a crisis to serve its own interests. "An epidemic of church burnings is the sort of crisis that engenders respectful attention from the press, opens wallets of the people on the mailing list, and provides a virtually unassailable vehicle for the advancing of the group's larger agenda," Kelly wrote. He quotes the NFPA as saying the number of fires is actually down.

Also citing the NFPA as well as southern law enforcement officials, Michael Fumento charged in a *Wall Street Journal* op-ed that portraying the church fires as a serious crisis was a deliberate hoax by the Center for Democratic Renewal. "What the Klan could no longer do, a group established to fight the Klan is now doing... frightening black churchgoers," the conservative attorney wrote.

The problem with the analysis of these three writers is their over-reliance on data that is likely to be incomplete and misleading. Insurance industry statistics, for example, can omit cases of arson at black churches, especially those in rural poor areas, since they are sometimes uninsured. And using data compiled by the National Fire Protection Association — which Fumento himself admits is limited — is a sure way to dismiss claims of racism. Because the association does not keep statistics by race, it has no way to determine how many black churches burn. Nor are official statistics likely to reveal an accurate count since only about 44 percent of all fires are reported each year. Further limiting the accuracy of information, NFPA gets much of its data from reports filed by state agencies to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. States are not required to file these reports and not all do.

### A Legacy of Racism
Finally, all three writers depend on federal and state law enforcement officials to determine if the fires are racially motivated acts of terrorism or simple arson. While both Kelly and Fumento question the motive of civil rights leaders for calling attention to the church fires, they wholeheartedly accept the conclusions of law enforcement officials. This bias ignores the fact that many of these agencies have been accused of racism and, as a matter of record, have led attacks on blacks.

The FBI assault on black liberation movements is well known. Through its COINTELPRO (Counterintelligence) program, the bureau targeted black leaders including Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, the Black Panthers, and Elijah Muhammad of the Nation of Islam. The goal, according to an August 25, 1967 memo from J. Edgar Hoover, who spearheaded the program, was to "expose, disrupt, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities" of black groups and leaders. One of the people who helped to implement COINTELPRO was James O. Ingram. He is now director of Public Safety in Mississippi and leads the investigation into the black church fires.

Over the years, the FBI has come under criticism for targeting black elected officials such as Mayor Richard Arrington of Birmingham, Alabama, and many members of the Congressional Black Caucus. In the mid-1970s, the ATF was instrumental in framing the "Wilmington 10," a group of North Carolina civil rights activists led by Ben Chavis, wrongfully jailed for racial violence and burning a white store. Instead of going after Klansmen — who were suspected by community members of starting the racial violence and torching the store — the ATF coerced three black prisoners into blaming Chavis and the others. Although the three later admitted lying, the FBI and a federal court refused to reopen the case and the 10 served a number of years in prison before international pressure forced their release.

In 1995, the ATF again gained attention for its racism when it was discovered that many of its agents had attended a "good-ol' boy roundup" in Tennessee, where racist literature was sold and skits degrading blacks were performed. Some of the agents who attended these roundups were later assigned to the church burnings. They were removed after public outcry from the black community. Just recently, ATF settled a lawsuit by 240 current and former African American agents charging racism and overt discrimination. The FBI has also been sued numerous times by black agents for discrimination.

### Racism? What Racism?
There is a difference between the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and in Oklahoma, and the attacks on black churches. For one thing, no one has yet been killed in the church arsons. But the number of incidents and the extent of the damage to community is far from insignificant, and the terror they spread is part of a long historical pattern. Different, too, is the reluctance of officials to brand the church burnings as terrorism. Even in the downing of TWA Flight 800, when terrorism was only suspected, the threat to public safety was considered so serious that vast investigatory resources were instantly mobilized. In the church burnings, however, every reason other than political motivation or terrorism is given while the media and official investigators discount or downplay the role of racism. "When it comes to attacks on black people, the terrorist or attacker is always given the benefit of the doubt," says Selma, Alabama attorney Rose Sanders.

And while there is doubt of some overarching conspiracy, that question is largely irrelevant — either to defining the crimes as terrorist or to understanding that they are fundamentally racist. There is a long history by the Klan and other white supremacist groups of targeting churches. These attacks hit at the heart of African American life in the South and, like cross burnings and lynchings, they are designed to show blacks who is in control and to keep them in their place in a white man's world. A government that does not act swiftly to investigate and deter these crimes as good as lays the tinder and provides the matches for the destructive fires of racism.

## Seeing Green: The A.I.D.ing of the Environment
**The mantra of sustainable development has replaced the dogma of anticommunism as a post-Cold War AID continues to make the world safe for US investments.**

**by Tom Barry**

Around the world, from Prague to New Delhi, from Mexico City to Moscow, US government officials and consultants are preaching sustainable development. The green in these environmental assistance programs is not only the color of "environmentally friendly" policies, it is also the color of money. The problem, the US tells other nations, is environmental degradation; the solution is expensive US environmental technology and services (ET). US aid money, the official line goes, is available to subsidize the cost of that technological fix, but only if the recipient country first implements structural adjustment programs that facilitate US trade and investment.

Nor is the US coy about admitting that this post-Cold War spin on the traditional politics of foreign aid is primarily a self-serving sales pitch. Under attack by Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and the right, the Agency for International Development (AID) has been quick to point out that "foreign aid is not something we do for others, but something we do to preserve and protect American interests and values." According to AID, the degradation of world-wide natural resources hurts productivity, which, in the integrated global economy, translates into reduced trade and investment opportunities for the US.

When he went before Congress to defend the agency's budget, AID head Brian Atwood stressed the link between environmental aid and US exports: "Does it make any sense for America to potentially turn away from a $300 billion annual market in environmental goods? Without US support for environmental programs under way in these countries, American firms will be losing their comparative advantage. It makes no sense at all to drastically cut these funds and shoot our own businesspeople in the foot."

Corporations — especially those manufacturing the products that will be exported — applauded the taxpayer-supported environmental assistance schemes. James Wolf, Honeywell's vice president of Energy and Environmental Markets, was enthusiastic: "AID's assistance paves the way for US technology and know-how in the emerging markets." But, he warned, "Reducing [AID's] commitment to sustainable energy policies and programs will undermine our competitiveness in international markets."

An array of US agencies — including the Energy and Commerce Departments, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Export-Import Bank — have joined together to push the new greenish agenda. With AID in the lead, the Clinton administration is proposing to: change environmental policies overseas while encouraging foreign governments to purchase US technology; foster the sell-off of government-owned utility and energy companies while facilitating US investment in the privatized companies; earmark environmental assistance funds, particularly in the energy sector, for the purchase of US products; provide technical aid and training by representatives of US ET firms; and establish programs dedicated to promoting ET trade.

### Free Market Environment
The integration of environmentalism into US foreign policy started in the 1970s when US environmental organizations insisted that AID assess the environmental impact before beginning major development projects. For a while it seemed that concern for environmental rights might limit the reach of US corporations and impose global standards. Some activists were hopeful when the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, or Rio Earth Summit, helped launch new US government programs focused on the global environmental crisis and environmental protection.

It turned out, however, that the most enduring legacy of the Rio Earth Summit was its call for "sustainable development through trade liberalization." At Rio, official circles agreed that free-market economics was the best way to protect the environment and promote development. They used the notion of sustainable development to rescue and protect the traditional concept of economic growth and to deflect environmental critics. As Wolfgang Sachs, an ecological economist, observed, "Environmentalism has become the highest form of developmentalism."

Neatly sidestepping the question of whether Cold War development patterns are still appropriate, Agenda 21, the document of the 1992 Rio Summit, proposed a fix for any environmental problems that result from industrialization, urbanization, agribusiness, or resource depletion. By importing "cleaner technology" from the North, the South could continue developing its energy and industrial infrastructure while reducing the associated levels of pollution. This technological fix was supposed to benefit the South (more efficient production) as well as the North (increased exports). While the value to either the South or the global environment is doubtful, the emphasis undoubtedly allowed the US to increase its dominance of the international market in environmental technology and services, a business that brings in $14 billion in foreign sales.

### Free Market Solutions
AID, no longer preoccupied with the threat of communism — but suddenly worried about charges of post-Cold War irrelevancy — knew a good thing when it saw one. The agency quickly adopted the language of the Earth Summit and redefined its core mission as sustainable development — to be built on the three pillars of democracy promotion, free-market economic solutions, and environmental protection. About 80 percent of foreign aid goes to American consultants and supplies and never leaves the US. Between 1990 and 1996, about 12 percent of AID funding, approximately $650 million a year, was dedicated to environmental assistance.

AID's green camouflage allowed it to dodge several political bullets. Instead of radically redefining what is meant by the term "development," aid agencies took an end run on the problem by advocating development that is more resource efficient. Instead of recognizing that the global ecology cannot support the continued consumption habits of the industrialized nations or the adoption of these patterns by less developed states, the industrialized nations are promoting the export of pollution-control and energy technologies. They are also pushing recipient countries to place a higher priority on programs such as reforestation and biodiversity protection that are intended to alleviate the global environmental crunch. The advantage to this resource-efficient sustainable development model is that it is compatible with those economic policies that benefit the industrialized nations: liberalized trade, capital flow, debt payment, and structural adjustment.

The argument that free trade is conducive to sustainable development is made not only by traders and investors, but also by many of the most influential environmental organizations. Groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund contend that economic growth makes more money available for environmental projects and that liberalized trade opens up countries to the pro-environmental influence of US policy makers and NGOs (non-governmental organizations). Thus enriched and enlightened, these nations will complete the circle and adopt sustainable development policies.

Meanwhile, AID — by trying to juggle the often incompatible goals of promoting US business interests and addressing environmental considerations — has tied itself in ideological knots and limited its effectiveness. The agency's conception of conservation and environmental problem-solving is straitjacketed by its commitment to increasing economic growth and private sector profits. Its philosophy of free-market environmentalism preempts consideration of development alternatives that emphasize quality of life over capitalist growth and that expand rather than shrink the regulatory capacity of the public sector. In the end, because of its close association with business interests, AID is one more US government agency with a mandate to promote the export of US goods and services.

### Special Place for the Private Sector
The US government's foreign assistance program does not simply fund projects, it also uses aid to leverage recipient governments. Wherever AID distributes environmental aid, it also shapes environmental policy. Although the agency's focus varies by country, a common element is the promotion of private sector domination of environmental programs. In Bulgaria, for example, the agency's declared objective is "the forging of environmental policies to favor private sector, market-based solutions; improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector environmental investment; and supporting market-based approaches to biodiversity preservation and enhancement."

Consistent with the neoliberal argument that the public sector is an obstacle to economic efficiency, AID argues that the private sector is the most appropriate and efficient source of environmental solutions. Critics counter that the private business sector, by definition, seeks to maximize profits, not to serve the commonweal. Only government, which gains legitimacy by providing economic and social stability, can ensure that development is environmentally sustainable. And only a strong public sector — local, national, and international — can guarantee that private use of natural resources does not endanger the common good.

Caught up in the logic of neoliberalism, the US pressures aid recipients to downsize the public sector by selling off state corporations, cutting budgets, and turning over such social services as health care, education, and natural resources management to private business. While this strategy creates new opportunities for US investors and generates cash to service external debt, it leaves recipient governments without funds or capacity to protect their natural environments.

Because the AID-funded programs also reflect this emphasis on private sector solutions, they often end up providing more help to US businesses than to the environment. More than other program areas, except those explicitly aimed at promoting private business, AID's environmental assistance program is integrally tied to fostering US trade and investment. AID describes its approach as a "partnership" between government and businesses to protect the environment, but unlike most financial partnerships, one side takes few risks. The exports and foreign investments by US business benefit from an array of US government services and subsidies.

### Better Red Than Green
A good example of the self-serving character of US aid is the US/Asia Environmental Partnership (US/AEP), which operates under AID's Center for Trade and Investment Services. Established in 1992 with a $100 million AID grant, US/AEP is a promotional organization for ET exporters and investors designed to increase US participation in Asia's environmental protection and energy industries. It seeks to link US businesses with governments and business sectors in the Asian/Pacific region, which has the world's highest growth rate in the use of environmental technology. US/AEP works closely with another AID-financed organization, the Environmental Technology Network for Asia, which provides grants to local businesses and institutions for US environmental technology and services. None of the several US/AEP programs makes any attempt to evaluate the quality of the technology they promote or determine if it is appropriate to local conditions. As an analyst with Environmental Business International observed, "The purpose of AEP is to sell, sell, sell."

AID's environmental assistance, often carried out in association with the World Bank, is also a key component in the US aid that flooded the former Soviet bloc after the disintegration of the USSR. Aimed at overhauling the economic and political systems, the FREEDOM program for the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union and the SEED program for Central and Eastern European countries couple policy reform with project assistance.

In describing its environmental program for the Czech Republic, the State Department is blunt about the link: "US environmental assistance to the Czech Republic is designed to support economic restructuring and reduction of environmental threats to human health through three objectives: supporting reform of the environment-related legal, regulatory, and policy environment; strengthening the institutional capacity in environmental management; and increasing the level of environmental investments."

In addition to tying environmental aid to the purchase of US goods, Washington also controls how the local currency generated from the grant is used. The local currency that the private sector and public sector companies and institutions give to the government in exchange for the dollars needed to purchase US technology goes into a fund controlled by Washington. AID has contracted with a corporate NGO, World Environment Center (WEC), to direct the use of this fund in the Czech Republic and other nations receiving SEED and FREEDOM grants. In addition, the WEC consultant helped draft an environmental liability law — a precondition for foreign investors who are reluctant to invest in privatizing state enterprises until laws are passed that limit their liability for environmental damages. A major conduit for AID's and EPA's technical assistance to foreign governments, WEC exists to serve the interests of transnational corporations. Nine of its 15 board members and officers are corporate representatives, and one of its main programs, the International Environment Forum, is "a group of 65 major multinational manufacturing corporations" that "meets quarterly for off-the-record discussions with senior policy makers from around the world."

Typical of US environmental aid programs, AID in the Czech Republic hired a US consultant to ease American investment in local businesses. The program provides technical assistance to Czech companies "to facilitate their access to financing and opportunities for joint ventures with US companies" and "to familiarize them with US environmental equipment, technologies, and engineering consulting services."

The energy assistance part of the US environmental aid program in the Czech Republic also keeps US business interests in mind. As in other transitional nations, state-owned energy and utility companies are being rapidly privatized. Under AID sponsorship, Houston Lighting and Power, the "sister utility" of Czech Power Works, provides information and support in this process. Central Maine and Electroteck "are working with the Prague distribution company on its strategy for selecting foreign partners." AID has contracted with another US company, FGG/Hagler, Baily, to develop markets for energy and environmental services that will be needed as economic restructuring and privatization advance.

In neighboring Slovakia, the same kind of "foot in the door" environmental assistance programs are helping US corporations grab a piece of privatizing power companies. In the name of helping the global environment, AID has contracted with the US-based Bechtel Corp. to guide restructuring of the power sector. AID has also hired Bechtel and the US Energy Association (USEA) to help the Anti-Monopoly Office (established to oversee privatization) prepare a new energy law. Interestingly, many USEA members are legal monopolies in the US.

Throughout the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, AID's environmental program is busily opening the doors for such US companies as Westinghouse and General Electric. Two-thirds of AID's energy assistance goes to these regions, mostly to create markets and investment opportunities for US firms in the coal, electricity, and oil/gas industries that are privatizing under pressure from AID and the World Bank. In case after case, public concern over environmental degradation has been subsumed by the neoliberal reliance on private sector growth to solve all problems. The point was not lost on Tayfun A. Gunusen, Moscow director of Burns and Roe Enterprises, which has a multimillion dollar contract with AID. Asked about the benefits of AID assistance, he said, "I don't see it as foreign aid. I see it as business development for US companies in general."

### Attacked at Home, EPA Heads Abroad
US environmental technology providers also have a friend in the EPA. Through its Office of International Activities, the agency encourages foreign governments to buy technology and consulting services from the same polluting industries that attack the EPA at home. Unlike such institutions as Eximbank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and AID, which help finance US trade and investment, EPA's business promotion efforts are less direct. Rather than directly financing environmental technology exports or investment, the EPA encourages governments to adopt environmental policies while at the same time sponsoring demonstrations of US technology. The agency also hires US businesses to provide the necessary technical assistance and training.

Although the EPA officials, unlike those for AID, et al., are careful to measure the success of their overseas work in environmental terms, the agency often appears to be an extension of the Commerce Department. Together with AID, Commerce, and US West, EPA collaborated on the publication of *The Green Pages*, an environmental technology advertising forum and directory of ET providers. Demonstrating the "important role EPA can play in the environmental export promotion arena," EPA officials now commonly accompany overseas trade and investment missions sponsored by Commerce. After returning from one such trip to India, Alan D. Hecht of EPA's Office of International Activities explained: "EPA's international programs do play a critical role in promoting the competitiveness of US environmental technologies and expertise abroad. By helping other countries develop environmental regulatory and enforcement capabilities that drive demand, EPA helps create a market for environmental technology and services overseas. By promoting the upward-harmonization of standards and the implementation of international environmental agreements, EPA helps 'level the playing field' for US business and industry and ensures that US companies do not operate at a competitive disadvantage."

In addition to helping rewrite the environmental laws of many countries, EPA sponsors "technology centers" in Poland, Russia, China, the Czech Republic, and the Ukraine that showcase US technology. Their success is measured in dollars: $5 million in US environment technology with sales agreements for $25 million more.

### Contracting with NGOs
In addition to working closely with private, particularly US, business partners, AID channels much of its environmental funding through nongovernmental organizations. The five largest recipients — World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, World Environmental Center, World Resources Institute, and Conservation International — operated overseas with $132 million from AID grants in 1993. In the US, most of this NGO funding goes to a few of the largest and more conservative environmental organizations. These groups are likely to have the international programs and the bureaucratic infrastructure to administer government grants.

They are also likely to be comfortable with the ideology, goals, and methods of AID and to support US foreign economic policy, particularly with respect to free trade and economic liberalization. For example, while the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and many locally based environmental organizations opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Wildlife Fund, Environmental Defense Fund, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Nature Conservancy echoed the Clinton administration's position: that the agreement would benefit the people and environment of both Mexico and the US.

Academics David Barkin and Stephen Mumme summarized some activities and issues associated with the role of US environmental NGOs (ENGOs): "Over the last two decades, ENGOs have sought direct influence in policy decisions in [low-income countries (LIC)] in matters related to their interests; they have courted and lent support to indigenous ENGOs and built linkages with fledgling organizations devoted to environmental causes; they have lobbied elites in the private sector to intervene on their behalf; they have exerted pressure on their home governments to intervene in LIC environmental management; and they have inserted themselves, with considerable success, into the business of financing environmental policies, whether through debt-for-nature swaps or direct project reviews and lending of the major multilateral development banks."

In recent years, the ambitions of these conservative green groups have expanded and their interventionism is more pronounced. "Indeed," concluded Barkin and Mumme, "a number of ENGOs either tacitly or explicitly assume that they enjoy the moral authority and political power to project their influence into the sovereign affairs of LICS."

This is not to say that NGO involvement in the environmental affairs of other nations is necessarily bad. In many cases, the conservation programs they support and the parks they help establish are badly needed. The fundamental problem is not so much that the projects are financed by the US-backed ENGOs, but that local organizations and governments often have little authority or input in design or implementation.

The superior resources and information of the ENGOs, together with the clout they get through association with the US government, enable them to set the environmental agendas of other countries. A related problem is that the environmental objectives of most AID-funded NGOs are too narrowly framed and do not reflect the serious social and economic conditions of the affected states.

### Shift to the Future
The question, then, of whether it is possible for US government agencies to advance environmental concerns when they are pushing corporate interests is not the only one being raised by critics. Perhaps more crucial is whether the environmental aid and technology transfer programs that the US is so enthusiastically exporting are appropriate to political, social, and economic conditions of Third World countries. And given the general record of US aid programs, that concern is well justified.

While the general failure of past US aid policies is commonly acknowledged in both government and NGO circles, global environmental deterioration has highlighted the unsustainable character of current US and multilateral development projects. Particularly worrisome is support for high levels of chemical inputs in farming, hydroelectric dams, centralized industrial development, and a concentration on agroexport agriculture.

Recognizing that threats to the planet's ecology also represent threats to economic expansion, the world's industrial nations are taking steps to manage the global environment. But rather than targeting the main sources of global pollution and the principal consumers of global resources, they are calling for better management of development in the South.

By stressing the global rather than the local character of the environmental crisis, and by raising alarm about the loss of tropical forests and the rapid rise in the use of fossil fuels in such countries as India, the North has shifted responsibility from itself to the South. Rather than seriously addressing their own rampant consumerism and high per capita energy use, the governments of the wealthier nations and institutions push a policy of risk management on the South.

This skewed focus has sparked charges of "green imperialism" or "eco-imperialism." Critics in the South argue that if the world's wealthy countries are so anxious about the planet's environment, they should curtail their own wasteful production before raising alarm about increased pollution in poorer nations.

Other objections from the South are that their environmental priorities are not the same as those of the North and that increased spending on health care and education is more urgent than funding for environmental protection. As Daniel Esty, author of *Greening the GATT*, has concluded, "The failure of industrialized-country environmentalists to build their policies on a foundation that recognized basic human needs in the developing world is the source of much of the North-South tension over trade and environment."

Arguing that all nature is part of the global commons, environmental organizations and governments in the North assume the moral right to intervene abroad to protect flora and fauna in foreign countries. By focusing on the future rather than on the environmental sins of the past and present, the institutions of the North justify policies that place the burden of easing the global environmental crisis on the South. As Vandana Shiva, an analyst of global environmental politics, observed, "Through a shift from the present to the future, the North gains a new political space in which to control the South."

Green imperialism is facilitated by the superior financial, informational, and technological resources of the North. Its experts determine the character of the environmental crisis and decree its solutions. Meanwhile, its businesses and nongovernmental organizations, using government revenues, provide the environmental technology and manage the environmental projects. Just as the North sent out legions of experts to chart the course of development, it is now deploying its technology and know-how in the South to help manage the new era of sustainable development.

## Insiders Blow the Whistle on Brookhaven Dangers
**by Karl Grossman**

The radioactive chickens are coming home to roost at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Set up by the US government in 1947 to look into civilian uses of nuclear technology, its officials and scientists have long promoted all things nuclear. They were instrumental in getting the local utility, the Long Island Lighting Co. (LILCO), to embark on a failed program to build seven or more nuclear power plants — to turn Long Island into a "nuclear park" that would provide the Northeast with electricity. LILCO's chair to this day is former BNL Assistant Director William Catacosinos. BNL also has done — and is still doing — military nuclear work. In the 1980s, it was central to planning a nuclear-propelled rocket to loft heavy Star Wars equipment into space and it is now working on accelerator designs to produce tritium for nuclear bombs.

All along, BNL officials and scientists downplayed the dangers of nuclear technology and minimized the effects of radioactivity. This lack of concern has resulted in massive radioactive and chemical discharges and BNL's designation as a Superfund high-pollution site by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Two inside whistle-blowers have stepped forward and charged BNL with disregard for public safety. Long Island organizations such as Fish Unlimited, an Island-based national fisheries group, Sound and Hudson Against Atomic Development Alliance (SHAD), and the new Peconic Green Party, have made BNL their major target. Independent scientists are backing up the activists' charges with new documentation linking BNL's emissions to breast cancer mortality in Suffolk County, Long Island, home of the lab. In February, 16 Long Island residents filed a $1 billion class-action lawsuit charging that radiation discharges from the lab caused cancers and other illness in the community.

### Spreading Radiation
It isn't that BNL, built on a former army base 44 miles east of Manhattan, is different from other US government nuclear facilities — just worse. According to new research by epidemiologist Dr. Jay M. Gould, based on National Cancer Institute data, communities around major national labs have shown marked increases in age-adjusted breast cancer mortality. The result of nuclear operations between 1950 and 1989 at six other facilities was a 35 percent average increase in cancer in surrounding counties compared to an overall one percent national rise. The area around Brookhaven, however, was hit hardest. Suffolk County's 40 percent increase was "the biggest increase in age-adjusted breast cancer mortality during that period for any single large county in the US," says Gould, author of the just-published *The Enemy Within: The High Cost of Living Near Nuclear Reactors*. Gould found that communities closest to BNL have the most serious cancer problem, and connected the high incidences to the radioactive poisons BNL routinely discharges into the environment.

From its 30-megawatt and 3-megawatt reactors — the only nuclear reactors on Long Island — and from its other nuclear operations, BNL routinely discharges radioactive poisons — especially cesium-137, strontium-90, and tritium. The Peconic River, with headwaters on the BNL site, contains, as a result, concentrations of these radionuclides. Tritium has been found in the Peconic at 37 times the proposed Canadian standard. And the radionuclides have been found in nearby wells and in public water supplies. BNL also has emitted — and continues to emit — radionuclides into the air.

### Coming Clean
"If people knew about what really goes on at Brookhaven National Laboratory," said Kenneth Dobreuenaski, who worked there for 14 years, "they'd make the lab clean its act up — and do it damn fast." A radioactive materials technician, he became so outraged by reckless releases of radioactive material that he went public in early 1996. "There's no accountability at the lab. You have to understand the mentality of some of the scientists there: They'd roll around in a pile of plutonium," he said.

In an incident reminiscent of the Karen Silkwood case, the BNL whistle-blower was subsequently ordered into a "hot laboratory" to clean up "contaminated silt." After refusing, Dobreuenaski said he was given a hearing before a BNL board and a choice: "Take a demotion, drop to the bottom of the seniority list and get a cut in pay," or quit. He initially chose to stay, but after being "assigned to sit in a little trailer, with no bathroom, with an algebra book all day," he had had enough. After two months of intense harassment, Dobreuenaski quit. "[It] got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore," he said.

Joseph Carson, an inspector for the Department of Energy (DoE), which owns BNL, also became a whistle-blower as a result of his experiences at the lab. An engineer who served on nuclear-powered submarines and at three commercial nuclear power plants, he encountered what he describes as a "cover-up" in an investigation in which he was assigned by DoE to help examine the cause of a fire at BNL's 30-megawatt reactor. On March 23, 1994, BNL scientists bombarded a piece of uranium-235 with neutrons from the reactor core and 50,000 volts of electricity. They used Plexiglas, a highly flammable plastic, to hold the radioactive element in place. A fire erupted, exposing seven BNL staffers to radiation that also leaked into the air. Carson, who was assigned to investigate the incident, blamed BNL's "lack of compliance" with — and disinterest in — safety procedures.

It was not the first such incident that Carson investigated at the lab. In 1990, the alternating gradient synchrotron released "a radiation field" which spread over the parking lot. Instead of "figuring out what happened," Carson said, "the next day they repeated the experiment — to see if it would happen again." At other national nuclear laboratories Carson has investigated for DoE, he has often found a culture of "production first, safety second." But at BNL, it's "experiments first, safety second, third, fourth, fifth or whatever." Since speaking out about the fire at BNL, Carson has encountered intense hostility within DOE.

### A Means of Resistance
Long Islanders are organizing to challenge BNL operations. Fish Unlimited got involved in the summer of 1995 after the lab announced a plan to dump hundreds of millions of gallons of chemical- and radioactive-contaminated water into the Peconic River. The river feeds into the Peconic Bay system of Eastern Long Island, an estuarine area attracting marine life. The day before Fish Unlimited filed a lawsuit against BNL, the laboratory abandoned its dumping plan.

"We will no longer tolerate $500 million a year in taxpayer money [the approximate BNL budget] being used for the poisoning of our air, water, and people," declares Bill Smith, executive director of Fish Unlimited. He calls BNL "a cancer in our community."

The SHAD Alliance this year began demonstrating regularly at BNL's entrance. At a protest on the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, SHAD members carried signs such as: "The Lab Nukes Kids and Other Living Things" and "Remember Chernobyl — It Can Happen Here."

Ron Stanchfield, a founder of the Peconic Green Party, said the group has made BNL its main issue because "it's the most serious problem Long Island faces." The laboratory "has contaminated the environment and the people who live here."

### All the Way to the Bank
The $1 billion class-action lawsuit brought against BNL charges that "actions of the defendant were grossly, recklessly and wantonly negligent and were done with an utter disregard for the health, safety, well-being and rights of the plaintiffs." It further accuses BNL of "failure to observe accepted relevant industry standards in the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances" and BNL itself of being "improperly located on top of an underground aquifer which supplies drinking water to [a] large number of persons." The underground aquifer is the sole source of potable water for Long Island.

Attorney Richard J. Lippes, whose Buffalo, New York law firm successfully represented residents of the Love Canal neighborhood, is counsel for the lawsuit along with Charles Rosen and Craig Purcell, last year's president of the Suffolk County Bar Association. In July, BNL sought to have the suit dismissed in New York State Supreme Court, claiming that "air and water are owned by the public" and individuals "can't sue" for its contamination. Lippes' rebuttal began by citing a suit in Justinian Roman times brought because "a piggery polluted the air and water." He commented at one point that the BNL attitude is: "We're the government, we will help you."

Giving a very human face to the hearing were the plaintiffs sitting in the courtroom gallery. Barbara Osarczuk, who has lived just outside the BNL boundary for 28 years, blames her thyroid and breast cancer on the laboratory. Her neighborhood is a hot-bed of cancer, she said, and BNL has tried "to cover this up." Randy Snell of nearby Manorville said his four-year-old daughter has mouth and throat cancer, which he attributes to BNL. "The more we look into BNL pollution, the more we discover," said Snell, a banker with Citibank.

### Friends in High Places
Government is doing nothing about the BNL situation — or worse. An attempt by Suffolk County Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr. to get the state legislature to investigate BNL has garnered no support. Meanwhile, Thiele said, on the last day of the legislative session this year, a bill came "flying out," which would have set up a "citizen oversight committee" for BNL. It actually consisted of only one plain citizen, and he is a former lab scientist. Included among the other panel members were BNL Director Dr. Nicholas Samios and representatives of other government entities. "The committee would be packed with the very people responsible for the problem in the first place," Thiele said. Despite the objections of Thiele and other legislators, the bill easily passed.

Another committee set up to investigate BNL, proposed by two Suffolk legislators, would have been chaired by a former lab consultant. Criticism stopped the ex-consultant, Dr. Roger Grimson of the State University at Stony Brook, from being chair of the panel; he remains a member.

While those subjected to BNL's radioactive releases take to the streets and courtrooms, the lab continues to shield itself from public scrutiny and governmental oversight. On the federal level, this effort has been aided by contributions from top BNL officials to the coffers of Long Island congressional representatives.

Another BNL technique for gaining friends in high places is signing on congressmembers who have lost elections as consultants and lobbyists. After his defeat in 1988, BNL hired Republican Rep. William Carney, whose district included BNL and whose votes favored the BNL agenda. Now an active Washington lobbyist, he remains on the BNL payroll. After Democrat George Hochbrueckner lost his seat last year, the lab hired him as a consultant. Other former Long Island congressmembers who have become BNL consultants in recent years include Democrats Jerome Ambro and Thomas Downey, who has close links to the Clinton administration. While this kind of revolving door is not illegal, it does offer an example to legislators of what appointments might open to them after they leave office if they are on good terms with the lab.

### Dangerous Denial
When it comes to dealing with the public, BNL scientists adhere to their long-standing policy of denying the dangers of nuclear technology and radiation. A BNL flier given out at a recent public hearing declared: "We live in a radioactive world — radiation is all around us and is part of our natural environment."

It then asks people to "compute your radiation dose" by checking out exposure from a chest X-ray, an airplane flight, cosmic radiation, and "if you sleep in a double bed with your spouse."

In comparison, says the flier, "if you live at the BNL site boundary, drink groundwater from the area and eat fish from the Peconic River," your radiation dose would be just a fraction of that. Andrew Hull, former long-time supervisor of radiological monitoring at BNL and a leader of Suffolk Scientists for Cleaner Power & Safer Environment, which worked with LILCO in pushing its nuclear power plant program, has argued that BNL radioactive discharges were "within acceptable limits" — the continuing basic argument of BNL in justifying its emissions. Gould counters: "The problem is that no one really knows the true health effects on humans of years of chronic exposures to low levels of such radioactive fission products." And, "We must understand," he says, "that the US federal agencies responsible for our radioactive standards operated under great pressure to set them at extremely high levels in order to win public acceptance for nuclear operations considered vital for national security reasons." Hull and his BNL colleagues have gone public with their accepting stance toward radioactivity. Hull, with other BNL scientists, was a member of the government's "radiological emergency response team" which goes to nuclear accidents around the nation and determines their seriousness. In that capacity he investigated the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and, in a speech back at BNL, described it as "relatively minor,... a big media event."

"How dare they!" declared Dr. Helen Caldicott about BNL and its radioactive discharges in a recent speech, "Danger in Paradise" sponsored by Catholic Charities and Fish Unlimited. A founder and president of Physicians for Social Responsibility and a new Suffolk County resident, she has made BNL a major target. "You can't do dangerous things on top of an enclosed water supply," she said. BNL "shouldn't be there." She concluded by telling the 250 Long Islanders present: "Shut down Brookhaven!"

## AIDS: Conspiracy or Unnatural Disaster? Tracking the Real Genocide
**Theories that AIDS is a government conspiracy to destroy undesirable populations may make political sense, but are they supported by fact?**

**by David Gilbert**

AIDS has an uncanny knack for attacking people the dominant society considers "undesirables": gays, injection drug users (IDUs), prisoners, and people of color. The commonly cited US statistic — that African Americans have twice the AIDS rate as white Americans — understates the problem because it is based on the total number of cases since 1981. While white gay men constituted the large majority of cases in the early days, by the early 1990s the rate of new cases among Latinos was 2.5 times higher than among whites, and the black/white ratio was even starker at 5-1 for men and 15-1 for women. By 1993, AIDS had become the leading cause of death among African Americans between the ages of 25 and 44. Internationally, the racial disparity is even worse: About 80 percent of the world's 9 million AIDS deaths through 1995 have occurred in Africa, where 2 million children have already been orphaned.

### An Almost Perfect Fit
The correlation between AIDS and social and economic oppression is clear and powerful. What is more, the pattern meshes neatly with an extensive history of chemical and biological warfare (CBW) and medical experiments which have targeted people of color, Third World populations, prisoners, and other unsuspecting individuals. In the first North American example of CBW, early European settlers used smallpox-infected blankets as a weapon of genocide against Native Americans. A few centuries later, the US Army conducted hundreds of tests that released "harmless" bacteria, viruses, and other agents in populated areas; one was to determine how a fungal agent thought mainly to affect black people would spread. Washington also subsidized the pre-marketing tests of birth control pills — before a safe dosage was determined — on Puerto Rican and Haitian women who were not warned of the potentially severe side effects. Since the 1940s, the US has conducted 154 tests on 9,000 people — soldiers, mental patients, prisoners — many of whom had no idea of the risks involved. On another level, the drug plague in the ghettos and barrios — whether by intent or not — has the effect of chemical warfare against these communities.

The most apposite example is the four decade-long Tuskegee syphilis study. Starting in 1932, under US Public Health Service auspices, about 400 black men in rural Alabama were subjects in an experiment on the effects of untreated syphilis. They were never told the nature of their condition or that they could infect their wives and children. Although penicillin, which became available in the 1940s, was the standard of treatment for syphilis by 1951, researchers not only withheld treatment but forbade the men from seeking help elsewhere. This shameful "experiment" was stopped in 1972, only after a federal health worker who was involved blew the whistle.

Nor is experimentation on people of color a thing of the past. Beginning in 1989, 1,500 children in West and East Los Angeles and Inglewood were given an experimental measles vaccine as part of a government-sponsored trial. Most of the subjects were Latino or African American. The parents of these children were never told that they were part of an experiment with an unlicensed drug, and thus had a less than adequate basis for giving their consent. The Edmonston-Zagreb, or E-Z vaccine, was also tested in Senegal and Guinea-Bissau and Haiti, Guinea, and more than a dozen other Third World countries. Trials in Los Angeles, conducted with the cooperation of Kaiser Permanente, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Johns Hopkins University, were stopped two years later after questions were raised about the vaccine's relationship to an increased death rate among female infants.

When use of the experimental drug came to light, CDC Director Dr. David Satcher noted, "A mistake was made. It shocked me. But things sometimes fall through the cracks." Dr. Stephen Hadler, director of the epidemiology and surveillance division of the CDC's national immunization program, said that although researchers have not confirmed a causal association between the more potent dose of E-Z vaccine and the deaths, "it was enough to make the World Health Organization say that high doses of the vaccine should no longer be considered for use in kids." It should be emphasized, he told the *Los Angeles Times*, that the deaths occurred among children living in poor countries, many of whom were malnourished and did not have access to adequate health care. Hadler did not, however, emphasize that those same conditions are all too common in the US.

In light of this gruesome pattern and pervasive evidence in every corner of society that the lives of blacks are less valued, there are good reasons why so many prisoners as well as a significant portion of the African American community believe that government scientists deliberately created AIDS as a tool of genocide.

### Dangerous To Your Health
There is only one problem with this almost perfect fit: It is not true. The theories on how HIV — the virus that causes AIDS — was purposely spliced together in a lab — will wilt under scientific scrutiny. Moreover, these conspiracy theories divert energy from the work that must be done in the trenches if marginalized communities are to survive this epidemic: grassroots education, mobilizations for AIDS prevention, and better care for people living with HIV. They distract from the urgent need to focus a spotlight on the life-and-death issue of AIDS prevention and on the crucial struggle against a racist and profit-driven public health system that is responsible for tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.

After more than nine years doing AIDS education in prison, I have found these conspiracy myths to be the main internal obstacle — in terms of prisoners' consciousness — to implementing risk reduction strategies. A recent study at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, confirmed that African Americans who believe in the conspiracy theories are significantly less likely to use condoms or to be tested for HIV. Put bluntly: The false conspiracy theories are themselves a contributing factor to the terrible toll of unnecessary AIDS deaths. What's the use, believers ask, of making all the hard choices to avoid spreading or contracting the disease if the government is going to find a way to infect people anyway? And what's the point of all the hassles of safer sex, or all the inconvenience of not sharing needles if HIV can be spread, as many conspiracy theorists claim, by casual contact such as sneezing or handling dishes?

The core of the mind-set that undermines prevention efforts is "denial." People whose activities have put them at risk of HIV are often petrified and turn to conspiracy theories as a hip and seemingly militant rationale for not confronting their own dangerous practices. At the same time, such theories provide an apparently simple and satisfying alternative to the complex challenge of dealing with the myriad of social, behavioral, and medical factors that propel the epidemic.

While convinced that humans did not design HIV, my main concern here is not to disprove the conspiracy theories. Neither do I attempt to solve the problem of the origins of AIDS or even review the many different theories and approaches to that question. The origin of this disease, as of many others, is likely to remain unsolved for years to come.

Rather, the article examines the validity of one set of theories being widely propagated to prisoners and to African American communities: that HIV was deliberately spliced together in a lab as a weapon of genocide. What follows is a look at the major flaws in, and political agenda of, the major conspiracy theories. Readers uninterested in this detailed critique may skip to the section beginning with "The Real Genocide," which discusses the system that made these theories so plausible and that abets — as part of its routine functioning — the spread of AIDS to "undesirable" communities.

### Scientific Unraveling
An early version of the AIDS-as-biowarfare theory was based on the work of two East German scientists, Jakob and Lilli Segal, published by the Soviet news agency Tass on March 30, 1987. The Segals claimed that HIV could not have evolved naturally, being in fact an artificial splice between visna virus (a retrovirus that infects the nervous system of sheep) and HTLV-1 (the first retrovirus known to infect humans). This splice, they asserted, was created at the notorious CBW lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and then tested on prisoners in the area.

Finding the article politically credible, I sent it to Janet Stavnezer, a friend and long-time supporter of the civil rights and anti-war movements, who is a professor of molecular genetics and microbiology specializing in immunology. Her response was unequivocal: The Segals' splice theory is scientifically impossible.

A few years later, as perestroika spread, the Soviet Union withdrew these charges — whether out of good science or good diplomacy is unknown. In any case, by then, even non-scientists had noted flaws. For example, there was an obvious error of US geography. The Segals had speculated that the Maryland prisoners, once released, congregated in New York City, which then became the seedbed of the epidemic. But most Maryland prisoners would have returned to Baltimore, or Washington, DC — neither of which was an early center of AIDS.

Since the Segals, there have been a number of related theories that HIV was artificially created by splicing two existing viruses. One, set at Fort Detrick, puts the date back to 1967; another implicates the World Health Organization (WHO), starting in 1972. Stavnezer and Mulder debunk these theories by showing that none of the viruses posited in the various splice theories has nearly enough genetic similarity (homology) with HIV to be one of its parents.

Investigative journalist Bob Lederer conducted a separate inquiry into AIDS conspiracy theories for *CovertAction Information Bulletin* in 1987. One of his prime sources, Dr. David Dubnau, a long-time activist against CBW, was emphatic: The HIV splice theorists "are simply wrong," he said, and offered the same explanation as Stavnezer and Mulder. Lederer had written in the 1987 article that the various non-splice theories of dissemination were plausible. Recently, in light of current knowledge, he has revised his conclusion and determined that "None of the AIDS as CBW theories [including the non-splice theories] really holds up."

Needing a vehicle for the deliberate dissemination of the allegedly spliced virus, the conspiracy theorists also characterize vaccination programs (against smallpox in Africa, hepatitis-B among gay men in the US, and polio in various places) as examples of a CBW campaign. While vaccination programs with inadequate controls for contamination may have contributed to the spread of the infection, they could not have been a prime cause: The geography of the vaccination campaigns does not correspond with the locations of early centers of AIDS. Meanwhile, such unsubstantiated rumors can dangerously discourage people here and in the Third World from getting the same protection for their children that have done so much to stop diseases for more privileged whites.

There is another telling problem with the theories: timing. HIV almost certainly arose well before scientists had any reason to consider retroviruses as possible CBW agents to destroy the human immune system. The first human retrovirus (HTLV-1) was not discovered until 1977, and could not immediately be linked to any disease. Through the end of the 1970s the search for human retroviruses was propelled by speculation that they might cause cancer, not that they would target the immune system.

Since the epidemiological evidence shows AIDS in several countries in 1978, HIV (a virus with a long incubation period), had to exist at least a few years before that. And it is probably considerably older. Retrospective tests on 1,129 blood samples taken in 1971-72 from US injection drug users found that 14 were HIV positive. There are also cases of patients who died of AIDS-defining illnesses decades ago: a teenager in St. Louis in 1968, a sailor in England in 1959, and a Norwegian sailor, his wife and child in the late 1960s. Preserved tissue and blood samples from all of these cases later tested positive for HIV antibodies, although the more difficult direct tests failed to find the virus itself.

Medical case histories going back to the 1930s — the earliest period in which accurate records were kept — show isolated cases with all the earmarks of AIDS. Various analyses of the DNA sequences — a technique used for broad assessment of a specie's age — have provided estimates for the age of HIV that range from 30-900 years.

In brief, the lack of knowledge of any human retroviruses before the late 1970s and the compelling evidence for the earlier genesis of HIV virtually eliminate the possibility that scientists deliberately designed such a germ to destroy the human immune system. More specifically, and decisively, Stavnezer and Dubnau independently confirm that all the alleged splices are in fact impossible because HIV does not have nearly enough genetic similarity to any of the proposed parent viruses.

### Shyster Science
The most common source of the conspiracy theories circulating in New York State prisons is William Campbell Douglass, M.D. His article "WHO Murdered Africa," (referring to the World Health Organization), and his book *AIDS: The End of Civilization*, are prime sources for many black community militants and prisoners who embrace the conspiracy theory out of a sincere desire to fight genocide. But Douglass, who is white, expresses little concern for black lives. He instead states his purpose as being the defense of Western civilization, and describes his politics as "conservative" — which turns out to be quite an understatement for his ultra-right-wing political agenda.

Douglas taps into the font of mistrust created by the arrogance and glibness of establishment science. Quick acceptance of the still unproven African green monkey theory was especially suspect and led many people to react against the presumptions of mainstream medicine. Douglass' alternative, however, is a bizarre cocktail of half-truths, distortions, and lies. He fails to recognize a basic distinction in epidemiology — between the cause of AIDS (a virus) and a means of transmission (dirty needles). He evidently thinks that all RNA viruses are retroviruses, which is like thinking that all fruits are citrus. And his pronouncements on the possibility of transmission by insects display fundamental ignorance of the science involved. There is also something radically wrong with his statistics; he offers five different figures for the number of HIV-infected people in the US without trying to reconcile the variations. He also "proves" that HIV is a splice of two other viruses by comparing shapes, as depicted in his own crude sketches, when the scientific method for determining the degree of relatedness of different viruses is to make a detailed comparison of the sequence of the base pairs of nucleic acid in the DNA. Such an analysis disproves the splice theory.

### Fraudulent "Science"
Douglass goes beyond mere distortion when he reaches the core of his conspiracy. His "smoking gun" is an article from the Bulletin of the World Health Organization. In a blatant distortion of the 1972 article, Douglass claims that the World Health Organization called for the engineering of a retrovirus to cause AIDS. He is unequivocal: WHO is talking about "retroviruses" and is asking scientists to "attempt to make a hybrid virus that would be deadly to humans.... That's AIDS. What the WHO is saying in plain English is 'Let's cook up a virus that selectively destroys the T-cell system of man, an acquired immune deficiency.' " (Emphasis in original.) He presents an almost identical description in his book.

Aside from the unlikelihood of conspirators' publishing their evil plans, Douglass' characterization borders on fraud. The WHO article in question is not primarily about retroviruses; it is not at all about engineering new viruses; it never discusses making hybrids; and it is absolutely not about making a virus to destroy the human immune system. Anyone who takes the time to look at the original will find that it details a number of existing viruses that cause various illnesses in humans and other mammals. Evidence was emerging by 1972 that some of these viruses, in addition to their direct damage, impacted the immune system. The only call the article makes is to study these secondary effects. He offers only one quote from the original. Not only does he change the context, he omits the list of viruses under study. All the listed viruses were related to already recognized illnesses; most are not retroviruses; none is a retrovirus that affects humans; and none is a suspect in any of the proposed scenarios for HIV-splicing. Douglass has created a bogeyman out of thin air.

### Deadly Lies
Douglass' disinformation becomes a deadly threat when he discredits the very prevention measures needed to save lives: "It is possible," he wrote, "that even the government propaganda concerning intravenous drug use is a red herring. If the intravenous route is the easiest way to catch AIDS, why does it take as long as five to seven years for some recipients of contaminated blood to come down with AIDS?" Here, he seems to forget the well-established incubation period between infection with HIV and onset of AIDS, although he manages to remember it later when he refers to a "latency" period of 10 years.

And arguing that there isn't a perfect correlation between the number of acts of intercourse and infection, he declares "AIDS is not a sexually transmitted disease."

Then, after sabotaging prevention efforts by disparaging the well-established danger of needle sharing and unprotected sex, Douglass fuels hysteria with claims that AIDS can be contracted by casual contact. "The common cold is a virus," he says in his article. "Have you ever had a cold? How did you catch it?" By failing to differentiate between airborne and bloodborne viruses, he is conjuring up a scare tactic as scientific as a warning that your hand will be chomped off if you put it in a goldfish bowl because, after all, a shark is a fish. He also asserts, citing no evidence, that "the AIDS virus can live for as long as 10 days on a dry plate," and then asks, "so, are you worried about your salad in a restaurant that employs homosexuals?" People are understandably skeptical of government reassurances on any matter. But we can turn instead to the experiences of families of people with AIDS and of grassroots AIDS activists: There are hundreds of thousands of us who have worked closely with infected people for years without catching the virus. The unwarranted fears about casual contact deter sorely needed support for our brothers and sisters living with HIV infection and divert attention from the most common means of transmission: unprotected sex and shared drug injection equipment.

### Reactionary Politics
Despite the apparent irrationality, there is a coherence to Douglass' distortions and fabrications. They are driven by an ultra-right-wing political agenda that goes back to the 1960s, when he was a member of the John Birch Society and ran a phone line spouting a 90-second "patriotic message." In it, Douglass railed against the civil rights movement and denounced the National Council of Churches and three presidents as part of a "Communist conspiracy." Among the nuggets he offered callers in at least 30 US cities was the likelihood "that those three civil rights workers [presumably Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman] in Mississippi were kidnaped and murdered by their own kind to drum up sympathy for their cause." In another message, he predicted that "The Civil Rights Act will turn America into a Fascist state practically overnight."

Two decades later he was blaming gays for AIDS in *The Spotlight*, the organ of the ultra-right-wing Liberty Lobby, for which he wrote regularly and in which he ran advertisements for "The Douglass Protocol," his cure-all medical clinics. In 1987, he wrote, "some have suggested that the FDA is waiting for the majority of the homosexuals to die off before releasing ribavirin," a drug he was at the time promoting as a miracle cure for AIDS. Douglass, however, opposed withholding a "suppressed" cure, "although I feel very resentful of the homosexuals because of the holocaust they have brought on us." Later Douglass began promoting a strange cure-all treatment, photoluminescence, in which small amounts of blood are drawn, irradiated with ultraviolet light, and reinjected. Treatments at his Clayton, Georgia, clinic can span several weeks and cost thousands of dollars.

By 1992, when he wrote *AIDS: End of Civilization*, he saw AIDS as part of the "entire mosaic of the current attack against western civilization"; the term "western" being a thinly veiled code word for "white." He had also shifted blame from homosexuals to communists, and portrayed AIDS as a diabolical plot perpetrated by WHO, which "is run by the Soviets." In these later writings, Douglass weaves an elaborate and intricate plot describing how the communists — much like an invading virus — took over the machinery of the US Army's CBW labs at Ft. Detrick and the US National Institutes of Health in order to use them to create and propagate HIV.

Douglass is so mired in anticommunism that he fails to revise this scenario for his 1992 edition after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He even charges that a Russian, Dr. Sergei Litvinov, headed WHO's AIDS control program in the late 1980s, when, in fact, it was led by an American, Jonathan Mann, whose writings Douglass cites favorably on a number of occasions.

In the guise of a program against AIDS, Douglass proposes a basket full of policies favored by the ultra-right and neo-Nazis: support and strengthen the powers of local law enforcement; abolish the UN and WHO; and stop all illegal Mexican immigration into the US. Then there are his more specific proposals: mandatory testing for HIV; quarantine of all those with HIV; removal of HIV-infected children from school; and incarceration, castration, and execution to stop prostitution. He argues that if we don't overcome a tradition "where civil rights are more revered than civil responsibility," hundreds of millions will die. While such proposals may further the right's law-and-order agenda, a wealth of public health and activist experience has shown that such repressive measures are counterproductive. Discrimination and repression drive those with HIV and its high-risk activities underground, making people unreachable for prevention, contact notification, and care. And here is the final appeal in his book: "[I]t appears that regulation of social behavior, as much as we hate it in an egalitarian society such as ours, may be necessary for the survival of civilization."

### Sign of the Times
As bizarre, self-contradictory, and refutable as his pronouncements are, Douglass is not an isolated crackpot. A fellow conspiracy theorist with whom he shares much common ground is Lyndon LaRouche, a notorious neo-fascist with documented links to US intelligence agencies. LaRouche's "National Democratic Party Committee" organized the intensely homophobic campaign in 1986 for California's Proposition 64, which, had it not been rejected by voters, would have mandated an AIDS quarantine. In 1989, Douglass and many key LaRouchites spoke at a conference which focused on various conspiracy theories for the origin of AIDS. The "scientific" source that the LaRouchites used for their reactionary campaign is Robert Strecker, M.D., who also addressed the conference. Douglass has worked closely with Strecker, considers him a mentor, and dedicates *AIDS: The End of Civilization* to him.

Michael Novick reported in White Lies/White Power that within the far right, it is "The LaRouche groups that are particularly dangerous because, despite their fascist orientation, they have been attempting to recruit from black groups for some time." The political analysis of Bo Gritz, head of the "Populist Party" is another source for AIDS conspiracy theorists. As Novick's book shows, the "Populists" use anti-business rhetoric to try to recruit among the left, but the organization has deep roots in the Ku Klux Klan and strong ties to the extreme white-supremacist Christian Identity.

When such forces propagate AIDS conspiracy theories among African Americans, one result is to divert people from the grassroots mobilization around prevention and education that could foster greater cohesion, initiative, and strength within the black community. At the same time, the right fans the flames of homophobia which combines with the problem of racism within the predominately white gay and lesbian movement to undermine a potentially powerful alliance of the communities most devastated by government negligence and inaction on AIDS.

We live in a strange and dangerous period when the attractive mantle of "militant anti-government movement" has been bestowed on ultra-right-wing, white supremacist groups. The main reason they can get away with such a farce is that their big brother — the police state — did such an effective job in the blood-soaked repression of opposition groups such as the Black Panthers, which was rooted in the needs and aspirations of oppressed people.

With people's movements silenced, the right has coopted the critique of big government and big business to achieve new credibility. The seedbed of discontent comes from the erosion of the previous guarantee of economic security and relative privileges for a wide range of white people in the middle and working classes. The right, however, portrays the threat as coming from the inroads made by women, immigrants and people of color. Thus their vehemence and militancy spring from the same legacy of white supremacy and violence that is the basis of the government they criticize and their program is in essence a call to return to the pioneer days' ethos that any white male had the right to lay a violent claim to Native American land, African American labor, and female subservience.

Whatever the right's motives, the practical consequences are clear: There is a definite correlation between believing these myths and a failure to take proven, life saving preventive measures. In the end, the lies promulgated by the likes of Douglass, Strecker, and LaRouche kill.

### The Real Genocide
The *New York Times*, in an editorial expressing alarm that an "astonishing" number of African Americans believe in conspiracies — with AIDS as a prime example — could only understand the phenomenon as "paranoia." Educated white folks, to the degree they are aware of such matters, tend to be "amazed" by such beliefs. But what is truly amazing is that so many whites are so out of touch with the systematic attack by the government-medical-media establishment on the health and lives of African Americans. The stonewall of calculated ignorance and denial that blacks face every day is a fine surface on which to write conspiracies, and may explain why some people become vested in a plot scenario that seems to crystallize the damage.

But the problem is far more powerful and pervasive than any narrow conspiracy theory can capture. And although the health horror this society imposes on African Americans is not a "mainstream" public issue, black people know what they are experiencing. They also know that the radical gap between the life expectancy of African Americans and that of white Americans was there even before AIDS burst onto the scene. A 1980 Health and Human Services Department report showed that there were 60,000 "excess deaths" among blacks. This is the number of black people who would not have died that year if blacks had the same mortality rate as whites. That figure marks more unnecessary deaths in one year alone than the total number of US troops killed during the entire Vietnam War.

The black body count is a direct result of overwhelming black/white differences in living conditions, public health resources, and medical care. The infant mortality rate — a good indication of basic nutrition and health care — is more than twice as high among black babies as among whites, while black women die in childbirth at three times the rate of whites. There are also major differences in prevention, detection, treatment, and mortality for a host of other illnesses, such as high blood pressure, pneumonia, appendicitis and cancer. Comparisons are even starker when class as well as race is factored, and, of course, the health status of both Latinos and poor whites is worse than that of more affluent whites.

The situation has worsened since 1980 with the advent of AIDS and the new wave of tuberculosis. TB, long considered under control in the US, began a resurgence in 1985. One big factor was the greater susceptibility of HIV-infected people to TB. But TB is an important example for another reason: It has always been closely linked to poverty. Crowded tenements, homeless shelters, jails, inadequate ventilation, and poor nutrition all facilitate the spread of this serious disease. Given the distribution of wealth and privilege, it is not surprising that the rate of TB for black Americans is twice that for white Americans.

African Americans are also assailed by a range of problems such as high stress, poor nutrition, and environmental hazards. One significant example of environmental hazards is the excessive blood levels of lead in children — a condition with proven links to lowered academic performance and to behavioral disorders. In 1991, 21 percent of black American children had harmful quantities of lead in their blood, compared with 8.9 percent of all US children. In addition to disease, the high rate of black-on-black homicide — a secondary but particularly painful source of needless deaths — is in its own way a corollary of the frustration and misdirected anger bred by oppression.

### STDs and Drugs
The evidence is clear that far from being a mysterious new development, AIDS and other epidemics and health hazards flow most easily along the contours of social oppression. There are two particular ways in which the racist structure of US society fosters the spread of HIV: The public health system fails to stem the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); and the legal system seeks only to punish drug abusers rather than treat them or ameliorate the underlying social and economic causes.

A major risk factor for HIV transmission is untreated STDs. These infections can concentrate HIV-laden white blood cells in the genital tract; and can also cause genital sores, which are easier points of entry for HIV. Although STDs can be readily contained by responsible public health programs, rates began to soar for blacks in the mid-1980s, with, for example, a doubling of syphilis for blacks from 1985 to 1990. At the same time, rates have remained stable for whites. This grave racial difference probably results from the lack of adequate STD clinics and the failings of public health education, along with the more general breakdown in social cohesion and values that can affect communities under intense stress.

Drugs, along with the violence and police repression that accompany them, constitute a plague in their own right for the ghettos and barrios. However, the public perception that illicit drug use is more prevalent among non-whites is wrong. Household surveys conducted by the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that African Americans, 12 percent of the US population, comprise 13 percent of illicit drug users. Where there is a tremendous difference, though, is in incarceration. Seventy-four percent of the people in prison for drug possession are African American.

There is also a major racial disparity in terms of drug-related infection by HIV. While partially a result of which drugs are used and how they are used, there is certainly a big and deadly difference in access to new (sterile) needles and syringes through either pharmacies or personal networks. Also, on the street, the police are much more likely to stop and search blacks and Latinos. This practice deters injection drug users of color from carrying personal sets of works (in states where they are illegal) and pushes them instead to share needles at shooting galleries.

### Criminal Negligence
The latest example of the public health failing concerning AIDS is hardly known beyond the immediate circles of AIDS workers. Studies completed in 1993 showed that the previously recommended and widely disseminated protocol for cleaning needles with bleach does not work.

Yet there has been no wide-scale effort to sound the urgently needed alarm about this grave danger. The literature since 1993 has delineated a new, more effective bleach method that entails using 100 percent undiluted bleach (as opposed to a 10 percent solution) and holding the bleach or rinse water in the needle and syringe, while shaking and tapping, for a full 30 seconds for each step of the nine-step process. However, most IDUs do not even look at new handouts because they believe they already "know" the bleach method. In addition, public health authorities have taken no responsibility for the type of training it takes to get an IDU, anxious to get high, to properly complete such a complex and time-consuming process.

One reason the authorities haven't trumpeted warnings about the problems with bleach may have more to do with politics than public health: The assumption that there is an easy method of bleach sterilization serves as a buffer against pressure to implement sorely needed needle exchange programs. There is impressive evidence that these programs, which allow IDUs to obtain new, sterile needles and syringes, are highly effective in reducing HIV transmission, while there is no evidence that they lead to any increase in drug use. Needle exchange programs could even serve as an outreach and contact point for reducing drug use — if "anti-drug" politicians allocated funds for treatment instead of incarceration.

Despite the clear public health evidence, many politicians have opposed needle exchange programs out of fear of being labeled "soft on drugs." Meanwhile, the rate of HIV (seroprevalence) among IDUs in states where needles are proscribed is five times higher than in states where they are legal.

Tens of thousands of IDUs, their lovers, and their children have been condemned to die because health agencies won't advertise their mistakes and because politicians posture for political advantage by banning the use of federal AIDS funds for needle exchange programs.

Shared needles is just one area of potential risk reduction. For overall prevention to work, the most effective and documented method of sharply reducing HIV transmission is peer education. Homeboys and homegirls with appropriate training in HIV/AIDS information speak the same language, live in the same situations, and can work with the people in their communities in the consistent, caring way needed to change risky behaviors.

Meanwhile, prisons provide fertile ground for peer education. They have some of the highest HIV rates in the US, and people who might have been constantly on the move in the street are now stationary and congregated. The vast majority of prisoners eventually return to their outside communities — where they can spread either AIDS awareness or AIDS. But prison administrations have generally been hostile to peer-led HIV-AIDS education; only a pitiful handful of such programs exist, and those are often hamstrung by bureaucratic restrictions.

Allowing misinformation about cleaning needles to persist, blocking needle exchange programs, failing to treat STDs, and thwarting prison peer programs are major examples of the continuing official criminal negligence with regard to AIDS — and in particular, how this plague has been allowed to explode in the ghettos and barrios.

### Fight the Power
Waiting for the government to act is suicidal. The peer education model shows that when we take responsibility for ourselves, our families, and our communities, we can make a big difference. Through grassroots organizing, communities can ally to demand social use of social resources instead of allowing tax dollars to go to massive military budgets and corporate welfare schemes. What we don't need are the fundamentally right-wing conspiracy theories of Dr. Douglass and the like that lead us on a wild goose chase for the little men in white coats in a secret lab. The false information they purvey — that HIV is spread by casual contact but not by sex and drugs — generates cruelty toward people with AIDS and fosters support for a police state. In a bitter twist, these conspiracy theories divert people from identifying and fighting back against the real genocide.

While US government plots such as the secret radiation and Tuskegee experiments do in fact exist, the damage they've done is small compared to the high human costs of the everyday functioning of a two-tiered public health system that is rooted in racism, sexism, and profiteering.

Overall, the living conditions of people of color in the US are a concatenation of epidemics that cascade through the ghettos and barrios: AIDS-TB-STDs; unemployment, deteriorating schools, homelessness; drugs, internal violence, police brutality, wholesale incarcerations; violence against women, teen pregnancies, declining support structures for the raising of children; and environmental hazards. These mutually reinforcing crises flow from decisions made by government and business on social priorities and the allocation of economic resources. Government policies that have such a disparate impact on survival according to race can be defined as genocide under international law. Whatever term is used, the cruelty of tens of thousands of preventable deaths is unconscionable. This reality is the basis for the scream of a people that "mainstream" society seems unable or unwilling to hear. These conditions are the real genocide in progress that must be confronted.

6. Various theories of AIDS origins include a virus that jumped species, an accidental byproduct of biological warfare experiments on animals, a new viral mutation, and a virus that lived in an isolated ecological niche until new social conditions facilitated the explosion of an epidemic. There is also a set of theories based on the now highly dubious proposition that HIV does not cause AIDS. For an excellent discussion of HIV's likely history and the social factors that facilitated the explosion of the epidemic, see Gabriel Rotello, "The Birth of AIDS," *OUT*, Apr. 1994.
7. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is one of the subset of viruses known as retroviruses. A retrovirus stores its genetic information in the form of a single-stranded RNA instead of the more usual double-stranded DNA. Only after the retrovirus penetrates the host cell does it construct a DNA version of its genes, using a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase.

But, while true that other possible co-factors with HIV (e.g., drug use and/or germs such as "mycoplasmas" and/or past infections that weaken the immune system) have not been given enough attention, the scientific evidence for HIV as a prime causative agent is now extremely convincing. Retrospective studies of stored blood samples show patients infected with HIV long before any other known event might be responsible for breakdown of their immune systems.

## IN MEMORIAM: SEAN DAVID GERVASI
CAQ is deeply saddened by the untimely death of Sean Gervasi, a renowned economist, teacher, and writer, who had been a frequent contributor to this magazine and its predecessor, *CounterSpy*, since the mid-1970s. Gervasi, 63, died suddenly of stomach cancer on June 17, in Belgrade, where he had been teaching.

Sean Gervasi studied at Geneva, Oxford, and Cornell. After the Bay of Pigs invasion, he quit his job at the Bureau of the Budget to begin a long career as a progressive and iconoclastic academic and activist, becoming a leader of the anti-Vietnam War movement in England. After teaching at Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics, he spent 15 years at the UN, much of it assisting Seán MacBride at the Committee on Decolonization, the Center Against Apartheid, and the Commission for Namibia, as the head of which MacBride received both the Nobel Peace Prize and the Lenin Peace Prize.

During that period Gervasi uncovered the secret and illegal sale of US weapons to South Africa, which he exposed in a widely circulated 1976 article in *CounterSpy*. Over the years, he painstakingly documented the role of the CIA in the Third World, including efforts to remove MacBride as Commissioner. He was the first to describe in detail the CIA's secret media budget, in CAQ in 1980. His seminal article on the destabilization of the Soviet Union, published in CAQ in 1990, continues to be cited for its clarity and its prescience.

Gervasi was an adviser to a number of African, Middle Eastern, and Caribbean governments, and for the past several years had been immersed in analyzing events in Yugoslavia, including the massive misinformation and disinformation in the world press, particularly against the Serbian people.

Sean Gervasi is survived by his wife, Heather Cottin Gervasi, his son Alexander Gervasi, and his daughter, Nora Cottin Gervasi. We extend our profound condolences to his loving family. His wit and humor, as well as his insight, will be sorely missed.

## Off the Shelf: Books of Interest

### Death of Somoza: The First-Person Story of the Guerrillas Who Assassinated the Nicaraguan Dictator
### Tunnel to Canto Grande: The Story of the Most Daring Prison Escape in Latin American History
**by Claribel Alegría and Darwin Flakoll**
**CURBSTONE PRESS, 1996, 1

**by Claribel Alegría and Darwin Flakoll**
**CURBSTONE PRESS, 1996, 161 & 193 PP., $12.95 PB. EACH**

Claribel Alegría is one of Central America's best known poets and novelists, but along with her recently deceased husband, Darwin Flakoll, she here turns her writer's eye to the inside stories of two of contemporary Latin America's most stirring guerrilla actions. Alegría's revolutionary credentials, developed in the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan struggles, granted her entrée to the innermost circles of two revolutionary groups, Peru's MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement) and an itinerant cell of the Argentine ERP (Peoples' Revolutionary Army). The resulting volumes, based on hundreds of hours of taped interviews with the participants, are gripping, nail-biting, life-and-death narratives sure to keep readers on the edge of their seats.

*Death of Somoza* recounts the ERP cell's meticulously planned, months-long effort to track down and assassinate the former Nicaraguan dictator as he led a life of gilded exile in Asuncion, Paraguay. On September 17, 1980, they succeeded. Ambushed as his limousine left his estate, Somoza died in a hail of machine-gun and bazooka fire. The ERP's action was more than revenge for Somoza's crimes; it decapitated the anti-Sandinista movement, and by forever precluding the possibility of Somoza's return, it helped solidify the nascent Sandinista government.

*Tunnel to Canto Grande* tells the story of the Peruvian MRTA's audacious and ultimately successful attempt to free 48 of its members, including its leader, Victor Polay, from Peru's highest-security prison. After renting a house under the shadow of Canto Grande's watchtowers, MRTA members worked around the clock for months to tunnel some 200 meters into the prison. All 48 prisoners escaped into a network of Lima safe-houses; the operation's only casualty was a prison guard hit over the head with a soda bottle when he had the bad luck to come upon the fleeing guerrillas.

Both books succeed wildly as true-life thrillers. Alegria and Flakoll have reconfigured their participant interviews into seamless narratives full of small but crucial details. But the volumes also leave something to be desired. Both provide only the scantiest political context for the events they describe, an oversight more damaging in the case of the Somoza assassination, where both the action and the actors cross international boundaries and which involved the cooperation of various continental revolutionary organizations. In fact, the assassination of Somoza, a self-described act of "revolutionary internationalism," involved Argentine guerrillas who left Spanish exile to join the Sandinista revolution in 1979 and enlisted the help of Colombian, Brazilian, Paraguayan, and Argentine citizens or organizations in their plot.

While Alegría and Flakoll note the assassination's internationalist antecedents, they have next to nothing to say about this broader context; neither do they address the murky past and mysterious connections of the ERP cell's acknowledged head, Enrique Gorríaran Merlo (the book's "Ramon"), the only surviving member of the original ERP leadership. Gorríaran has connections to some of the hemisphere's most dramatic and haziest events: the Argentine "dirty war," the La Penca bombing (its supposed perpetrator allegedly died in another Gorríaran adventure), and the abortive, deadly La Tablada uprising in Argentina in 1989. Arrested in Mexico last year while traveling under an assumed name, Gorríaran is now in custody in Argentina. But the book that answers the questions surrounding his career has yet to be written.

Similarly, Alegría and Flakoll can be accused of operating with too much solidarity and not enough journalistic skepticism. For instance, they take at face value Gorríaran's claim that the ERP squad operated independently, with no foreknowledge by Sandinista leadership, at whose pleasure they stayed in Nicaragua. Neither do they question the size or origins of the Swiss bank accounts under Gorríaran's control. In both volumes, they rely almost exclusively on their subjects to provide a political analysis of their acts; they could well have subjected these analyses to rigorous scrutiny, but chose not to.

*Death of Somoza* and *Tunnel to Canto Grande* are page-turning reads and primary documents of the Latin American revolution. But because of their limited scope, they cannot stand as the definitive word in either case.

### Secret and Sanctioned: Covert Operations and the US Presidency
**by Stephen F. Knott**
**OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1996, ENDNOTES, BIBLIOGRAPHY, INDEX, 258 PP., $27.50 HB.**

"Does a real ... revolutionary movement exist there? Is it not, on the contrary, an artificial, concerted, contrived, patched up, miserable treason, paid for by our money, fomented by our people? Was it not solely occasioned by American interference — American instigation?"

What provoked this barbed senatorial query directed at a recalcitrant administration was not Reaganite atrocities in Nicaragua or Angola in the 1980s, but a presidential secret war nearly two centuries earlier. Hoping to foment a rebellion by American settlers in Spain's East Florida Territory and, ultimately, its incorporation into the United States, President James Madison had authorized secret agents with covert funds to enter the territory and create a secret army.

Madison's 1809 East Florida misadventure failed (Spain finally succumbed to diplomatic and economic pressure a decade later), but it was, Knott shows, no aberration. Relying on extensive archival research as well as a close — if arguable — reading of the Founders' debates over the proper scope of executive secrecy, the Air Force Academy historian exposes a lengthy, if little known, pedigree for contemporary covert operations and presidential autonomy in their authorization and funding.

Knott does a great service in lifting the patriotic veil that obscures some of the less statesmanlike actions undertaken by the men whose faces grace Mt. Rushmore, as well as their less monumental colleagues. Both Washington and Jefferson had skullduggery in their veins, from Knott's account, and Daniel Webster gains new distinction as the first secretary of state to use secret foreign policy slush funds in a covert campaign to sway domestic opinion — in Maine during boundary disputes with Canada. Once Webster had set the precedent, Lincoln followed suit, as did Woodrow Wilson after him.

Knott's research is largely historical — only the book's final 25 pages deal with the post-World War II period — but his agenda is fully modern. In this regard, *Secret and Sanctioned* is a contemporary — and reactionary — political argument wearing the guise of a historical monograph. Something of Knott's political perspective comes through when he wonders in passing "whether Jefferson would have tolerated a Soviet-dominated Cuba." Brief references as well to the "ludicrousness" of banning assassination as a policy tool or appreciating the "frustration" of the Reagan administration as Congress hamstrung its Central American proxy wars also clarify Knott's orientation.

For Knott, the fact that Washington, Jefferson, or Lincoln engaged in sporadic covert operations becomes an argument for freeing the modern presidency from the minimal restraints imposed on its covert abilities. To this end, he creates a straw man: Critics of peacetime covert actions, he writes, believe they began only with the Cold War, and from such a mistaken belief, that they fail to grasp the legitimacy precedent has given such operations. (The landmark Church Committee Report in 1976 was, in his words "a disturbing mixture of historical ignorance and moral fastidiousness.")

Knott has certainly broken new ground on the extent of previous covert operations, but informed critics have known for years that US presidents okayed operations such as the subversion of Hawaii (1890s), attempts to assassinate Pancho Villa (1916-17), or Joel Poinsett's machinations in Mexico and South America (1820s-40s). But even if, as he incorrectly argues, critics lacked a historical understanding of presidential prerogatives, Knott's appeal to tradition still runs up against the essentially anti-democratic nature of secret presidential adventures.

Not that he bothers himself greatly about such concerns. In fact, democratic assent to covert policy initiatives, as expressed however imperfectly through congressional oversight, is for Knott an impediment to "secrecy and dispatch" in foreign policy-making. Instead, he identifies the "most important reform" being one that would entirely eliminate congressional intelligence committees. In his view, Congress' rarely- and weakly-exercised oversight function threatens the very national survival. Congress, he claims, has the unseemly habit of interfering in covert operations, and "for every abuse that may have been prevented by the new restraint, the national interest has been harmed by fragmented decision making."
