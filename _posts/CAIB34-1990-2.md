## Editorial

This issue of CAIB is a glimpse at the many faces of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. From the CIA's involvement in a variety of conflicts in SouthEastAsia to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., we examine the breadth of illegal activities which the government attempts to cover up and which the mainstream media is afraid to explore.

Information about CIA operations in Central America continues to surface. The CIA organized and controlled a group of Costa Rican intelligence officers who, for large retainers, spied on their own government. For many years the CIA clouded the fact that Manuel Noriega's relationship with the Medellín Cartel made him a very rich man. However, when Noriega began to tire of toeing the U.S. line, George Bush decided to act. Panama was invaded, thousands of civilians were killed, and Noriega was captured. Now Noriega will stand trial for activities that the U.S. once condoned.

Perhaps even more appalling is the U.S. backing of the Khmer Rouge in their attempt to overthrow the Hun Sen government in Cambodia. Into this devastating conflict the U.S. government has sent food and covert military aid to support the guerrilla coalition. Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge is by far the strongest military contingent. If victorious, they would be in a position to gain complete power and return war-ravaged Cambodia to the nightmarish rule of the 1970s.

Finally, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. must be reexamined in response to new evidence which reveals that James Earl Ray may have been set up. A self-professed political assassin, Jules Ron Kimble, claims that he was part of a conspiracy to kill King. Kimble says that he helped several members of the CIA plan and carry out King's murder. Additionally, new evidence suggests that there was a CIA "identities" specialist who helped Ray develop his aliases.

These articles, as well as others in this issue, demonstrate how U.S. covert operations repeatedly work in direct contradiction to our society's professed values. If the United States is ever to achieve the openness and democracy that it so loudly touts to the world, it will first have to do away with the destructive operations of the CIA.

## Covert Operations in Costa Rica

**by Tony Avirgan***

Costa Rica has charged two CIA operatives with first degree murder for the 1984 terrorist bombing of a news conference at La Penca, Nicaragua. A request for the extradition, on murder charges, of Iran/contra figure John Hull has been forwarded to the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington and will soon be presented to the State Department.

Hull, a 20-year resident of Costa Rica, jumped bail last year rather than face drug and arms trafficking charges and is now living in Potoka, Indiana. The drug trafficking charges were suspended due to a technicality, but Hull now faces the murder charge as well.

The other CIA operative charged with murder is Felipe Vidal, who, since 1983, has clandestinely traveled between Central America and Miami. One of his pet projects was involving Cuban-Americans in the contra war so they could gain combat experience in preparation for a war against Cuba. [^1]

Several months ago, Jorge Chavarria, a senior prosecutor charged with overseeing an investigation of La Penca for the Costa Rican Attorney General, issued a preliminary investigative report exposing a conspiracy of espionage, drug trafficking, and murder carried out by U.S., Panamanian, and Costa Rican officials acting for the CIA. [^2]

The murder charges stem from that carefully footnoted, 54-page report. Chavarria, working with a special team of agents from the Office of Judicial Investigations (OIJ) – roughly equivalent to the FBI – says the 1984 La Penca news conference bombing was the work of Nicaraguan contras, the CIA, and Panamanian General Manuel Noriega. The report recommended that first-degree murder charges be filed against Hull and Vidal and that charges of "illicit enrichment" be filed against nearly a score of Costa Rican security officials who were secretly on the CIA payroll.

Most OIJ agents have been trained by the FBI, the CIA, or right wing security services in places such as Taiwan, Chile (under Pinochet), Argentina (during military rule) or Israel. [^3]

Chavarria and the OIJ agents who worked with him have become something of pariahs within their organization. The agents accused of working for the CIA have generally not denied the charges, but have argued that close cooperation with the CIA and the U.S. Embassy has long been the norm and had the approval of the highest Costa Rican authorities.

The La Penca bombing, at a contra camp just inside Nicaragua, killed three journalists – two Costa Ricans and a North American – and seriously wounded two dozen more. The intended target, maverick contra leader Eden Pastora, escaped with serious injuries.

Although the bombing itself took place just inside Nicaragua, all the planning and preparation took place in Costa Rica, the U.S., Honduras, and Panama. Costa Rican law allows for prosecution of crimes committed against Costa Rican nationals outside the country.

Hull has admitted in several interviews to taking orders and money from the CIA. Pastora says that he was first introduced to Hull by the then CIA station chief who said "Mr. Hull is your liaison." [^4] Hull's name appeared in diagrams in Oliver North's notebooks showing the supply chain to contras in Costa Rica.

Felipe Vidal, a shadowy Miami based Cuban-American, who spends much time in Costa Rica, has identified himself to numerous contras, including Pastora, as a CIA agent. He constantly carries a .45 caliber pistol in a shoulder holster and is known and feared among contras as an assassin. He kept a crossbow in a guest room at Hull's ranch. [^5]

The Attorney General's report blames Costa Rica's failure to investigate the crime for the past five years on the fact that police officials in charge of the investigation were being paid by the CIA. It says the CIA fed Costa Rican investigators false information.

The report also details the creation, by the CIA, of a special 15-member unit within Costa Rica's Directorate of Intelligence and Security (DIS). This unit took orders from the U.S. Embassy rather than from anyone in the Costa Rican government. It had its own offices, rented by the U.S. Embassy, and took orders from a CIA agent named Dimitrius Papas, according to the report. Papas, known as "Papi," called his Costa Rican underlings "The Babies." [^6]

According to various DIS agents interviewed by Chavarria, the formation of a special unit of highly trained intelligence agents was first suggested by the United States Embassy which offered to provide the training. The Costa Rican government of then-President Luís Alberto Monge accepted the offer and the U.S. Embassy appointed Papas, who was introduced to the trainees as a CIA agent, to instruct and lead the new unit. [^7] Under the leadership of Papas, "The Babies" soon moved into their own building and obtained vehicles, office equipment, and communications equipment, all paid for by the CIA.

According to Chavarria, "The Babies" "lost loyalty to their superiors" and set about spying on any Costa Rican official attempting to uphold the policy of neutrality at the expense of the CIA-backed Nicaraguan contras operating illegally in Costa Rican territory. The victims of this spying included President Mongé, and several pro-neutrality ministers of his government. Information about their personal lives was turned over to the CIA.

Papas didn't stop with "The Babies." According to Chavarria's report he also developed "a close bond" with the Department of Special Affairs of OIJ, which investigated matters touching on national security. The bond was particularly strong with OIJ agent Alberto Llorente, who named Papas godfather to one of his children.

Llorente was, at the time, responsible for OIJ's relations with the U.S. Embassy. He was also the senior agent assigned to investigate the La Penca bombing.

Papas ended up paying not just "The Babies" but also other members of DIS and OIJ. According to the report, he gave these organizations office equipment and equipment for phone tapping and electronic eavesdropping. Agents of all three Costa Rican organizations were being paid "per diems" for work done on behalf of the CIA. All of this was being done with no control whatsoever by the Costa Rican Government.

According to Chavarria, the payoff money was laundered through the New York office of "The Cardinal Association." The money was then channeled through the Costa Rican law firm of Zurcher, Montoya and Zurcher which passed it on to DIS agent and "Babies" member Vera Arguedas Serrano.

Some of the covert funds were funneled through the "Asociación de Asistencia Civica Costarricence" (Costa Rican Civic Association), which, according to Chavarria, continues to channel CIA funds to DIS today. All of these uncontrolled payments to government employees are illegal under Costa Rican law and Chavarria has recommended further investigation with the possibility of eventually bringing charges against members of the DIS.

Papas has since left Costa Rica, although journalists recently reported that he is in the U.S. Embassy in Panama.

Costa Rican intelligence and governmental sources have, in the past, accused "The Babies" of a variety of illegal actions including falsification of documents and break-ins at homes and offices of suspected leftists.

Soon after the La Penca bombing, "The Babies" prepared and circulated to journalists hundreds of documents allegedly "proving" that the Sandinistas had committed the terrorist action.

In addition to the murder charges, the report recommends charges of "illicit enrichment" against members of "The Babies" and dereliction of duty against the detectives who failed to investigate the La Penca bombing. It also recommends charges be filed against Oliver North's "messenger" Robert Owen, mercenary organizer Tom Posey, mercenary René Corvo, former CIA station chief Philip Holts, CIA operative and drug trafficker Moises Dagoberto Nuñez, CIA operative Frank Castro, and a number of Costa Ricans associated with the Nicaraguan contras.

Many of those named by Chavarria were previously named in a report last year by a Costa Rican Legislative Commission investigating drug trafficking. [^8] The Commission concluded that the arms supply network set up by the National Security Council, the CIA, and Oliver North to supply Nicaraguan contras in Costa Rica soon turned into a drug trafficking operation. As a result of the Commission's findings, the Costa Rican Cabinet last year declared Owen, former CIA station Chief Joe Fernandez, former Ambassador Lewis Tambs, North, and former National Security Advisor John Poindexter persona non grata in Costa Rica.

### The La Penca Bombing

Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica Deane Hinton said the latest report "is an invention." Hinton is now Ambassador to Panama. According to sources in the U.S. Embassy, Hinton circulated an order instructing all Embassy personnel to take every opportunity to denounce the Costa Rican La Penca investigation. Hinton, a veteran of covert actions, has served in such sensitive posts as Syria (1946-50), Kenya (1950-52), Guatemala (1954-69), Chile (1969-73), Zaire (1974-75), El Salvador (1981-83), and Pakistan (1986). [^9]

Costa Rican government sources say that Steven Groh, a "consular officer" at the U.S. Embassy, recently visited Government officials and demanded that they close down the Costa Rican investigation of La Penca. Referring to U.S. Federal Judge Lawrence King's dismissal of the Christic Institute's La Penca lawsuit, Groh said the matter had "already been dealt with" by the U.S. courts. (The Christic Institute suit is currently on appeal and King's dismissal is expected to be reversed.) The Costa Ricans patiently explained to Groh that U.S. courts have no authority in this sovereign country.

> Tony Avirgan was among the victims of the La Penca bombing. His wife Martha Honey and he conducted an investigation at the request of the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Newspaper Guild and concluded, in 1985, that the bombing had been carried out by the CIA and Nicaraguan contras. Their report named John Hull and Felipe Vidal as principals in the bombing. Their findings were denounced by the U.S. government and they suffered severe harassment, including the murder of a key source and the planting of cocaine in a book supposedly mailed to them by Tomas Borge, then-Interior Minister of Nicaragua.
>
> Their findings form the basis of a lawsuit filed on their behalf by the Christic Institute. The case was dismissed by a Federal Judge in Miami days before it was to go to trial. It is currently before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.

Diplomacy (State Department) circulated the story that the Basque separatist group ETA had carried out the attack on behalf of the Sandinistas. ABC news and the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour carried the planted story which was soon shown to be false.

Costa Rican officials implicated in the report, and sectors of the right wing press, have tried to discredit the findings, saying they represent a repetition of the charges in the Christic Institute La Penca law suit and the original La Penca investigation carried out by journalists Martha Honey and this writer (see box).

Asked about this, Dr. José Maria Tijerino, Costa Rica's equivalent of an Attorney General, said the prosecutor's investigation was carried out in complete independence and the fact that its findings coincide with the Honey/Avirgan La Penca report only strengthens it. He said "they were parallel investigations which reached the same conclusions."

Manuel Noriega was brought into the report in testimony saying he had aided CIA contra supply efforts by supplying pilots who also worked for the Medellin Cartel. Later he participated in unsuccessful CIA efforts to pressure Pastora to unite his forces with the largest contra faction, the FDN.

The report says it was Pastora's refusal to unite and his efforts to clean up drug trafficking on the "Southern Front" which led to the La Penca bombing. These findings are based on more than 50 sworn testimonies, transcripts of previous trials and testimony presented at U.S. congressional hearings.

The report was handed over to a "Judge of Instruction" who had to decide if the evidence was sufficient to bring charges. In early April, the Fourth Judge of Instruction in San José ruled that there is sufficient evidence to charge Hull and Vidal with first degree murder and attempted murder.

Under Costa Rican law, Hull and Vidal cannot be officially charged until they appear before a Costa Rican judge. With that end in mind, the murder charges and the previous gun running charge were joined to form the basis of a request to the United States Government to extradite Hull.

Since Hull took out Costa Rican citizenship in 1984, Costa Rican officials say the U.S. is obligated to send him back. However, Hull was allowed by the U.S. to retain his U.S. citizenship and, in the eyes of the U.S. government, he is a U.S. citizen. That would make extradition exceedingly difficult if not impossible.

> Hull, who jumped bail and fled Costa Rica last year after being charged with arms and drug trafficking, said from his home in Indiana, "I think the same thing I've always thought, the government down there is infiltrated and manipulated by communists led by the Christic Institute."

In a recent press release, Hull complained that the U.S. government is now harassing him about having dual citizenship. Hull was quoted as saying he took out Costa Rican citizenship because the CIA ordered him to.

Former contra leader Adolfo Calero and former U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica Curtin Winsor also rejected the findings presented in the report, sticking to the cover story that the La Penca bombing was carried out by the Sandinistas.

The day after the bombing, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the now defunct Office for Public

Much of the investigative work carried out by Chavarria and his team originated with leads provided in testimony given to the U.S. Congress in the Iran/contra hearings. Costa Rican authorities chose to follow up those leads. U.S. authorities, from the Justice Department to congressional committees, chose to ignore them. Despite the fact that a country friendly to the United States has charged a CIA agent and Iran/contra figure with murder in connection with a terrorist bombing which killed a U.S. citizen, the mainstream U.S. media has generally ignored the story.

## The Panama Connection: U.S. Addiction to National Security

**by Robert Matthews***

George Bush justified the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989 as an effort "to combat drug trafficking." An unnamed White House source best articulated the U.S. government's position when he said: "Doing away with the Panamanian connection – in the sense that Noriega condones and protects such activity [drug trafficking and money laundering] – would put one hell of a dent in the movement of drugs in organized crime. That's the bottom line." [^1]

However, Senator John Kerry (Dem.-Mass.), in summarizing the conclusions of his Subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism and International Operations, declared: "From what we have learned these past months our declaration of war against drugs seems to have produced a war of words, not actions. It seems as though stopping drug trafficking in the U.S. has been a secondary U.S. foreign policy objective, sacrificed repeatedly for other political and institutional goals such as changing the government of Nicaragua, supporting the government of Panama, using drug-running organizations as intelligence assets, and protection of military and intelligence sources from possible compromise through involvement in drug-trafficking." [^2]

What were the real reasons for the U.S. campaign against Manuel Antonio Noriega? This is the question which still hovers over the U.S. invasion of Panama or any speculation about the future of Noriega, currently prisoner number 41586-004 in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Miami. Why the implacable hostility when drugs, corruption, lack of democracy or human rights abuses (all charges eventually leveled against the Noriega government) never stood in the way of U.S. friendships with other governments? If the ouster of Noriega had to do mainly with drugs and corruption, why not sooner?

There is no simple answer to these questions. Yet for the U.S., the issue of Noriega's links to the Medellín cocaine cartel was not as the public perceived it – as a moral stance or a sincere attempt to hamper the flow of cocaine onto the streets of U.S. cities. Rather, narcotics were an indirect factor in a larger national security problem – Washington perceived that it was fast losing its grip over a key strategic country in its sphere of influence.

### Noriega and Drugs

Ever since the Nixon administration, the U.S. has had extensive evidence of Noriega's links to drug trafficking and other avenues of illicit enrichment. According to CIA official John Bacon, the U.S. had "hard" information, as early as 1971, on Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling – including witnesses who saw Noriega being paid off for military protection of drug shipments. The case was so strong that Richard Nixon ordered John Ingersoll, director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) (the precursor to the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA]) to Panama to talk to then-President Omar Torrijos about his wayward colonel. [^3]

However, Bacon admitted that the issue was not drugs as such, but the fact that Noriega was regarded as an unacceptable "national security problem." In 1973, an assassination team formed within the DEA was charged with eliminating Noriega. An agent was actually dispatched to Mexico to assassinate him but was recalled at the last moment by order of BNDD Director John Bartells. [^4]

Every administration from Nixon's on condoned Noriega's activities. Beginning in 1976, he received $100,000 annually from the CIA and met with then-CIA director George Bush. Jimmy Carter, the champion of human rights, overlooked drug smuggling and numerous human rights violations in Noriega's past in order to gain approval of the Panama Canal Treaty. Washington also feared that exposure of Noriega's illicit activities could undermine the Torrijos regime which the U.S. perceived as blocking the path to power of the mistrusted Panamanian nationalist Arnulfo Arias. A U.S. official said at the time: "We had drugs – and Noriega – all over the place." [^5] But Washington's attitude sent a clear message to Noriega as to what it considered important to U.S. interests. To a great extent, the vote in Congress on the Panama Canal Treaty was perceived as a referendum on drug dealing.

During debate over the treaty, Senator Robert Dole (Rep.-Kan.) filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act for all DEA files relating to Panama. Worried that the documents would fuel conservative opposition, the Carter administration "deselected" certain files and they were never handed over to Dole. Moreover, according to John Bacon, evidence which could have been used to indict Noriega was never returned. In fact, all Panama investigations had to be stopped because none of the files were available. [^6]

In addition, Carter, like other presidents, saw Noriega as too valuable an intelligence asset to be reined in.

By the early 1980s, U.S. officials were aware that Noriega was riding the crest of a tidal wave of Colombian cocaine sweeping into the U.S. His role was to facilitate the flow of drugs and money through Panama. The Medellín drug cartel paid Noriega vast sums of money for allowing access to secure airstrips and aircraft; for making certain that customs and immigration officials asked no questions; for arranging to launder drug profits through Panamanian banks; and later in the 1980s, for allowing narco-fugitives to remain in Panama. [^7] These drug profits were a sizeable supplement to his CIA "salary" which had grown to $200,000 annually. There were also side interests in such enterprises as a cocaine processing lab (which Noriega destroyed in 1985 to placate the DEA) and charter airlines specializing in transporting drug money in and out of the U.S.

The "hear no evil, see no evil" approach undertaken by Carter for the purpose of pushing through the treaty, was continued by the Reagan administration in its effort to topple the Sandinistas. [^8] The more cooperation Noriega offered U.S. intelligence agencies the less likelihood that his illicit activities would come under international scrutiny. According to Francis McNeil, formerly of the State Department, Noriega felt that "if he could keep us happy on Nicaragua, he could do as he pleased." [^9]

> ### The CIA station chief in San Jose, Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez, assisted in covering-up Noriega's role in the crime.

According to NSC member Norman Bailey, incontrovertible evidence on Noriega's links to cocaine trafficking was "readily available to any authorized U.S. official and was based on an array of human and electronic intelligence and aerial photography." [^10] Bailey stated that the information constituted "not just a smoking gun but rather a 21-cannon barrage of evidence..." that was "...at best ignored, and at worst hidden and denied, by many different agencies and departments [in the U.S. government]." [^11]

In mid-1985, Hugo Spadafora, who had been working with Eden Pastora's contra rebels in Costa Rica, met with DEA agents to denounce Noriega's drug dealings. Spadafora, the former Panamanian Minister of Health turned over evidence, consisting primarily of testimony by Noriega's pilots, implicating Noriega in the illicit drug trade.

Spadafora was brutally tortured and murdered on September 15, 1985 having last been seen in the custody of the Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF). An investigation conducted by the Organization of American States (OAS) implicated the Panamanian government in the murder but the U.S. State Department resolutely refused to pursue the case. The CIA station chief in San José, Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez, fronted for the Company's man in Panama, by assisting in covering-up Noriega's role in the crime. [^12]

That same year, Carleton E. Turner, then the top White House official on drug abuse, wrote a strongly worded memo to National Security Adviser John Poindexter about Noriega. The memo concluded that Noriega had consolidated control over drug transshipment points in Panama and that drug traffic "doesn't move thru Panama without Noriega and some of his people finessing it." [^13] Turner said that Noriega was clearly a national security issue. The memo was one of the factors which caused Poindexter to fly down to Panama to meet with Noriega. Although the substance of the meeting is disputed, Washington officials later claimed that the reason for the visit was to upbraid Noriega for his involvement in narcotics. [^14]

Yet the Reagan administration was far from united on whether or not Noriega presented a threat; a shift in policy came slowly and haltingly. In some sectors of the bureaucracy Noriega had open and vehement supporters. His chief defenders were CIA Director William Casey and former CIA official and then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-American Affairs Nestor Sanchez. [^15]

### Noriega: Company Asset

What was it that Noriega provided the U.S. national security establishment that made him so valuable? Over the years Noriega's relationship with the U.S. was filtered through various agencies. Until 1986 Noriega worked closely with the CIA, the National Security Council (NSC), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the DEA – the latter officially congratulated him for his efforts to prevent drug smuggling and money laundering in Panama. The coziest relationship was between Noriega and the CIA. CIA Director William Casey acted almost like Noriega's case officer, even inviting him for private meetings at his home. [^16]

In November 1985, Casey again brought Noriega to Langley. Although he possessed detailed evidence of corruption and human rights abuses, Casey chose to soft-pedal the matter in his meetings with Noriega. Casey's memo regarding the November meeting "made [it] clear that he let Noriega off the hook" on the corruption issue. After Poindexter admonished Noriega in December 1985, Casey followed up with a more conciliatory approach that undercut Poindexter's message. [^17]

In 1985, ultra-right Senator Jesse Helms (Rep.-N.C.) introduced legislation to cut off U.S. aid to Panama. According to a Senate source, "Casey called Helms and urged him to withdraw his amendment. He was very adamant about it. He said Noriega was doing things for the U.S. that Helms didn't know about." At this time the State Department was clearly wary of jeopardizing Noriega's services in the contra war and sent a ranking State Department official to convince Helms to withdraw the bill. [^18]

Before 1980, the arrangement between the U.S. and Noriega centered on exchanges of money for intelligence. From the early 1970s, Noriega provided data on Latin American armies and on guerrilla movements. During the Reagan era, the NSA vastly increased its intelligence-gathering activities in Panama through U.S. military components based there. By the mid-1980s, the U.S. was capable of monitoring all of Central America and most of South America from its Panama installations. As the site for U.S. Southern Command headquarters, bases for reconnaissance planes, and an NSA listening post, the Canal Zone was described “as an intelligence feast." [^19]

The U.S. knew that Noriega was trading information with Cuba that had been gleaned from U.S. intelligence data while, at the same time, keeping tabs on Cuba for the U.S. The consensus in Washington was that the U.S. was getting the better deal or at least enough of a deal to allow it to continue. [^20] However, in mid-1983, the U.S. sent members of a secret Army intelligence unit to Panama with orders to spy on and bug Soviet and Cuban facilities. Washington feared that Noriega was passing along highly classified information on U.S. military operations in Central America. The spy mission proved a resounding failure. [^21]

During the Reagan administration, the relationship between Noriega and the CIA solidified as a result of Noriega's support for U.S. operations in Central America. In particular, it was Noriega's assistance in William Casey's war against Nicaragua that endeared him to the CIA. Beginning with the Sandinista triumph in July 1979, the U.S. approached the Panamanians to help track the course of the Sandinista Revolution. During the first year Panamanian intelligence on Nicaragua was considered better than that obtained directly by the U.S. [^22] As late as 1986, Reagan administration officials noted with satisfaction that Noriega was still providing “sensitive information" on Nicaragua. [^23]

Noriega apparently served as more than a passive conveyor of intelligence for the U.S. war against Nicaragua. He allowed the CIA and NSC to set up shell corporations to finance the contras, [^24] launch spy missions, and send agents into Nicaragua from bases inside Panama. Noriega also agreed to allow the CIA and Pentagon to use Panama as a training site for the contras. During the period when the Boland Amendment restricted U.S. aid to the contras, Noriega permitted the CIA to use Panama as a transit point for money and arms to circumvent the law. Noriega held more than a dozen meetings with U.S. officials – at least three with Casey and a half dozen with Oliver North on how he could assist the contra war. The most frequent visitor during 1984-85 was Joe Fernandez, CIA station chief in Costa Rica, who relayed Casey's urgent desire for a southern front against Nicaragua." [^25]

There is evidence, albeit fragmentary, that as early as 1982, Noriega allowed contras to be trained on Panamanian soil and that in response to his cooperation his CIA retainer was increased. [^26] Ironically, the evidence lends some weight to Noriega's story that his refusal to train contras at Poindexter's request in late 1985 triggered the U.S. campaign to topple him. Bob Woodward reported a meeting between CIA officer Dewey Clarridge and Senator Patrick J. Leahy (Dem.-Vermont) in early 1983, in which Clarridge mentioned an agreement with Noriega to allow the CIA to set up a contra training facility. Clarridge warned that the facility must be kept secret for fear of Noriega canceling the agreement. [^27]

According to several sources, Noriega made other agreements with the U.S. which allowed the contras to be trained in Panama. Former chief of Panamanian intelligence, José Blandon, testified before Senator Kerry's subcommittee that in 1985, Noriega and Oliver North met aboard a yacht in the Panamanian port of Balboa and discussed the issue of training and supplying the contras – precisely at the time when the Boland Amendment ban was in effect. Elio Camarena, a former lawyer for the Panamanian Defense Forces, claimed that at about the same time the head of the U.S. Southern Command met with Noriega to discuss the need for areas outside of the U.S. to be used to train the contras. Soon after, the contras began training at Panamanian bases near the Costa Rican border and on the Atlantic Coast. [^28]

By 1984, Washington began to implement a plan to train unilaterally controlled Latino assets [UCLAs] in unconventional warfare. U.S. Special Forces were to provide their expertise at training sites in Panama and other countries. The Pentagon would thus assume a prominent role in training the contras in special warfare and civic action. [^29] The fact that bases in Panama were an essential element in the Pentagon's low-intensity conflict strategy probably accounts for the outspoken opposition of Defense officials like Nestor Sanchez to an anti-Noriega campaign that might jeopardize that relationship. [^30]

### Operation Black Eagle

> ### Operation Black Eagle was the brainchild of CIA director William Casey-an off-the-shelf project that was not officially sanctioned by any U.S. agency.

The centerpiece of the contra resupply effort in Panama was an operation code named "Black Eagle." The project was initiated in late 1982 and lasted until the end of 1985, overlapping with the plans of Oliver North and the CIA to divert secret money from Iranian arms sales to the contras. The sinister flip side of Operation Black Eagle was the use of its supply network to ship large amounts of cocaine into the U.S. [^31]

Operation Black Eagle was the brainchild of CIA Director William Casey – an off-the-shelf project that was not officially sanctioned by any U.S. agency. Casey enlisted the help of Israeli Mossad agents in Central America to facilitate the weapons transfer to the contras and provide the operation with cover. The person who was called upon to organize this massive aerial gun-running operation was Mike Harari. Harari, a shadowy former Mossad agent turned "private businessman," had obtained a $20 million credit from the Israeli government (later repaid by U.S. covert operations funds) to purchase arms for the contras. [^32] The operation involved using the Israeli military to purchase Soviet-made arms in Eastern Europe which were then shipped to Panama. From warehouses in Panama the military supplies were periodically flown to contra bases in northern Costa Rica or to Ilopango Air Force Base in El Salvador. [^33]

After negotiating with Noriega's intelligence chief, José Blandon, in the spring of 1983, Harari brought Noriega into the operation. Soon to emerge as the undisputed leader of Panama, Noriega played a key role in providing airfields, planes, and front companies. In exchange, Noriega was free to broker and protect shipments of cocaine and marijuana on the same fleet of cargo planes used to ship the arms. Three of Noriega's pilots who flew arms to the contras had been solicited in 1982 for transport services by the Medellín Cartel: Floyd Carleton Cáceres, César Rodríguez Contreras and Enrique Pretelt. They also had a history of flying weapons, first to the Sandinistas, then to the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador. Carleton claims to have been Noriega's liaison to Colombian drug lords and was responsible for collecting their payments. Cuban-American Ramon Milian Rodríguez, an accountant for the Cartel and convicted money launderer, claims that in one period he paid Noriega between $4-10 million per month for protection of drug and money shipments from Colombia. From 1979 to 1983, the payments totaled $320 to $350 million. [^34] José Blandon later testified that Noriega cut a deal with U.S. officials – one per cent of the gross income from his drug deals was set aside to buy additional weapons for the contras. By mid-1984, Oliver North entered the operation as field coordinator. [^35]

Arms dealer Richard Brenneke, whose participation in the enterprise was authorized by then-vice presidential National Security Advisor, Donald Gregg, painted a similar picture of the arms and drugs operation. He claimed that after dropping military supplies in Panama, transport planes would fly to Colombia to pick up cocaine, then take the drugs to the same warehouse where the guns were stored. From there, smaller aircraft would make weekly deliveries of arms to the contras and cocaine to the U.S. [^36]

The arms distributed through Operation Black Eagle were destined mainly for the contra faction, Revolutionary Democratic Alliance (ARDE). Panama's ties to ARDE's leader, former Sandinista-turned contra Eden Pastora, go back to the 1970s when Torrijos supported the Sandinistas in their struggle against the Somoza regime. When Pastora broke with the Sandinistas in 1981, he spent a month with Torrijos just before Torrijos was killed in a mysterious plane crash. [^37]

In the fall of 1985, Alvin Weeden, a Panamanian lawyer, declared that Noriega had sent Israeli arms to ARDE and had taken a large commission in return. Weeden was speaking as the representative of Hugo Spadafora, who had just left ARDE reportedly because of Eden Pastora's close ties to Noriega. [^38]

Given the background of the individuals involved in the resupply operation, it is not surprising that there was a direct connection between arms smuggling for the contras and drug smuggling for the Medellín Cartel. Planes flying from Panama were sometimes reloaded at contra bases in Costa Rica with cocaine destined for the southern U.S. and the proceeds were split between Noriega and the contras. [^39] Spadafora gave a detailed description to the DEA of the arms and drug network and Noriega's role in it. This information probably cost Spadafora his life. [^40]

A highly classified CIA study confirmed that contra leader Eden Pastora assigned one of his top officers to work with the drug traffickers. With the profits from drug sales, ARDE bought a helicopter and $250,000 of weapons. Another infamous player in this network was John Hull. The CIA used Hull's Costa Rican ranch as a contra base and distribution center for weapons. Hull's ranch became a transshipment point for cocaine flights into the U.S. [^41] In 1986, Elliott Abrams, while denying any involvement by the Honduran-based Democratic Nicaraguan Force (FDN), claimed that the U.S. had evidence implicating ARDE officials in drug smuggling. [^42]

The Israelis began to pull back from Operation Black Eagle in 1985 because of disputes with CIA officers in the region. Also, relations between the two intelligence agencies had cooled as a result of the Pollard spy scandal. For more than a year, the Israelis has used Jonathan Pollard to steal U.S. defense secrets which he then turned over to his Mossad handlers. The fact that Operation Black Eagle was eventually shut down mattered little to the contra resupply effort. The Reagan administration had grown bolder in its disregard for the law and the CIA became more confident in running the operation with its own personnel. [^43] Panama was becoming less important as a transit point because CIA operative Felix Rodríguez was sending covert military supplies to the contras via Ilopango Air Force Base in El Salvador. The drug profits were also less important because Oliver North had recently made millions of dollars from covert U.S. arms sales to Iran.

### A White House Liability

Eventually, the issue of Noriega's drug connections and corruption was interpreted as a national security problem for U.S. policy makers. The vast web of corruption gave Noriega an independent source of income which he skillfully manipulated to buy the loyalty of key Panamanian Defense Force officials. This rendered the PDF less amenable to the kind of bribery that worked so well in controlling the military elites of other U.S. client-states. Also, U.S. conservatives were again protesting – as they did during the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations – that Noriega's shady pursuits made him an unreliable ally and he could not be trusted with control over the canal. Finally, there were signs that drug corruption was sparking a domestic backlash in Panama which could destabilize the political situation in that country and thus endanger the Canal Zone.

> ### The post-Vietnam failure in the media and Congress to develop the U.S. Lawyers' interpretation of international law has permitted government officials to resort to force repeatedly without serious domestic challenge.

Up to mid-1987, the White House was sending signals to Noriega to curtail both his illicit activities and his independent course of action in Central America. But the situation was now coming apart for Noriega. In June 1987, a top PDF officer, Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera, publicly denounced the abuses of the Noriega regime. The dramatic accusations triggered massive demonstrations by thousands of Noriega opponents and spurred the formation of an opposition coalition, the National Civic Crusade.

The military used repressive measures in crushing the protests which further raised the specter of future political turmoil in Panama. In the minds of Washington policymakers, this foreshadowed the possibility of a future government unresponsive to U.S. interests in the region. For some time, Panama had been promoting a more radical international posture during an era when much of the region was bowing to U.S. pressure. The Reagan administration also expressed serious concerns about Panama's cooperation with the Eastern Bloc, especially regarding the transfer of high technology. [^44] In 1987, Noriega concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union to give landing rights to Aeroflot and to create a company to provide dry docks for Soviet fishing boats in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Even liberal Massachusetts Senator John Kerry accused Noriega of helping the KGB become active in Panama. [^45]

Administration hardliners believed for more than a decade that Torrijos's political project had dangerously flirted with the Left – both domestically and internationally. In 1985, NSC adviser Constantine Menges warned the Reagan administration "that a Noriega-led military regime in Panama would make it far more vulnerable to destabilization and ultimate takeover by radical pro-Cuban/Soviet elements." [^46] Noriega and PDF corruption, together with Panama's relatively independent foreign policy, risked opening the door to "leftwing elements." Among hardliners in the U.S. national security establishment, Panama was increasingly seen as a weak link in the Caribbean system and an undependable ally within the U.S. sphere of influence. Thus, Noriega's corruption could become an embarrassment for Washington and provoke a conservative reaction against the Canal treaties. The administration was even more worried about the future status of the 14 U.S. military bases in Panama.

Finally, the events of mid-1987 revealed that the threat of a nationalist backlash in Panama was much diminished and there was now at least a loosely organized opposition upon which to pin U.S. hopes. [^47] Noriega's ouster of Diaz Herrera, second in command in the PDF, and perceived by the administration as a dangerous leftist, removed another of Noriega's insurance policies. [^48] By 1987, the drug issue had translated into a security problem which was in turn subsumed under the general threat that the Noriega regime represented to U.S. hegemony. Panama, a country considered key in U.S. regional strategy, was becoming too autonomous and heading toward a state of destabilization inimical to U.S. interests.

### Prelude to Invasion

By fall 1987, the administration moved beyond its first step of pressuring Noriega to conform or step down. Following the lead of Reaganite zealot Elliott Abrams, the administration launched what amounted to a variant of its low-intensity warfare strategy (although it might have been more accurately called "high intensity dissuasion"). [^49] After Federal grand juries handed down indictments against Noriega in February 1988, the intensity of the campaign increased dramatically. The indictments charged Noriega with having taken $4.5 million in payoffs by allowing Panama to be used as "way station, clearinghouse or haven for some of the world's most violent drug traffickers, including those linked to the assassination of Colombia's Justice Minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla." [^50]

The Reagan administration not only refused to promote these indictments; it stonewalled the federal prosecutors until the last moment. While creating appropriate propaganda for the anti-Noriega campaign, many officials at the State Department felt that the indictments would undermine U.S. efforts to negotiate Noriega's stepping down. And, of course, the CIA was still withholding its support for the policy. Richard Gregorie, the Assistant U.S. Attorney gathering evidence for the indictments concluded that the "U.S. priority is not the narcotics traffickers but rather it's the clandestine affairs of our intelligence and foreign relations community." [^51]

In any event, the indictments swung the last bureaucratic holdouts onto Elliott Abrams's bandwagon. The program now gathered steam: continual military intimidation and provocations; economic and financial sanctions which eclipsed even those applied against Nicaragua; covert money to the Panamanian opposition; and even organizing anti-Noriega contras in northern Panama. The U.S. expected that the economic moves and paralyzing of the banking system would finish Noriega in a matter of weeks. When these predictions proved to be premature, Noriega came to symbolize the impotence of the scandal-ridden Reagan administration and later, the irresolution of the Bush administration.

The most unprecedented and successful aspect of the U.S. anti-Noriega program was the disinformation campaign designed to demonize Noriega and reduce the issue to a moral stand against drugs. The administration maintained that as Noriega's behavior became worse, it sought to distance itself from the regime. In fact the reverse was true. Noriega's relationship with the Medellín Cartel had cooled considerably since 1985 and his cooperation in campaigns against drug trafficking and money laundering were winning him letters of commendation from the DEA. [^52] As the U.S. increased pressure in 1986, the Medellín Cartel began to shift its operations to other Caribbean transit points like the Cayman Islands. In spite of this evidence, the myth grew that overthrowing Noriega would strike a blow against drug trafficking in the world.

U.S. policy, which was initiated for national security reasons and only indirectly concerned Noriega's drug involvement, took on a life of its own. There was no turning back; the door to a negotiated solution was effectively closed by the administration's own logic. A threatened and increasingly hostile Noriega, who would never again feel protected by his value to the DEA and the national security establishment, was clearly a much larger security problem now. The failure of two U.S.-supported coup attempts left Washington considerably embarrassed and the preservation of U.S. credibility in the region became paramount. The White House propaganda apparatus worked overtime and Congress and the media expressed not even a hint of skepticism: the case against Noriega was a noble fight against drugs, moral decay, and dictatorship.

When the inevitable "incidents" occurred the weekend of December 15, 1989, the Bush administration hesitated for two days, unsure that it had an adequate cover story for an invasion. The caution was unwarranted – White House propaganda had been so effective that the U.S. public needed little convincing. The U.S. had boxed itself in. Having raised the stakes it risked serious political damage if it did not act.

When paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division backed by an invasion force that included 24,000 troops and two F117-A Stealth bombers, landed in the early hours of December 20, 1989 there were few protests in the U.S. Unlike the invasion of Grenada, the media out did each other in parroting the Pentagon's line. Despite restrictions that should have shamed a free press, most journalists ignored civilian casualties and then collaborated in the cover-up of their number.

Just as they had uncritically accepted the silent war of attrition that Washington had waged against Panama during the past two years, the public applauded Bush's disciplining of an unruly colony. As the Cold War wanes and four decades of foreign policy assumptions crumble, it must have been heartening for the Bush administration to achieve this consensus without recourse to the customary anticommunist rhetoric.

For now, with Bush's popularity at an all-time high, the invasion is judged as a roaring success – "a political jackpot." When the Panamanians finally realize that they have not been so much saved as invaded, the true cost of the invasion – to both Panama and the U.S. – will begin to be reckoned.

## Testimony to an Invasion

On April 5, 1990, Olga Mejia, President of the National Human Rights Commission of Panama, spoke at the "Voices of Panama" public meeting at the Town Hall in New York City. The following is excerpted from her full presentation.

The U.S. invasion of Panama perpetrated by the 82nd Airborne Division under the U.S. Southern Command carrying out orders of President George Bush, is an act of genocide, qualifying as a crime against humanity and a violation of the sacred right to live, as affirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the internationally recognized Geneva Accords as well as all of the international agreements and enabling protocols that spell out the most basic norms of international coexistence. Just as in Grenada and Vietnam, this was never a "Just Cause."

One hundred days after the invasion, the occupying army continues to operate with impunity and the high cost in human life still remains to be brought to light. Violence, brutality and the abuse of power that cannot even be classified as unconventional warfare is used against the civilian, non-combatant population resulting in death, material losses, physical, and psychological trauma and injury to the integrity of the so-called prisoners of war. Arbitrary and illegal searches and seizures are committed by U.S. soldiers. Panama has been brought into the era of common graves, disappeared people, war refugees, and the ransacking of homes. An independent nation has been forced into submission by a colonizing army.

Chorrillo was a marginalized community of some 20,000 inhabitants. Five entire blocks were bombarded and 25th, 26th and 27th Streets where I was born and spent my early childhood were completely wiped out and converted into a graveyard. At 12:30 a.m. – in the middle of the night – the bombardment, the strafing and machine-gunning, the firing of rockets began. Later came the use of flame throwers, tanks, and the collective mourning.

They began with the bombardment of the Military Headquarters and then with the massacre of the civilian population. They machine-gunned wood-frame and plaster houses. The interiors of the buildings showed the evidence of high-calibre and high-power weapons used against the population as they slept in their beds just before Christmas. The buildings shook, the residents tried somehow to keep the kitchen propane gas tanks from exploding by bringing them into the bathrooms. The windows were shattered. The walls were filled with holes. The people ran huddled from room to room trying to protect themselves from the hail of bullets.

When the fire started, those who tried to get down using the elevators could not because the power had been cut. Many stayed during the early hours of the morning clinging to each other, hugging the walls of the buildings and risked burning to death or being asphyxiated by the smoke.

Many who ran out trying to flee from the fire and the bombardment died in the streets machine-gunned by U.S. troops. Others were burned to death in their homes or killed as their homes were bombed. Dawn found many dead in the hallways of their buildings, buried under the rubble or dismembered and totally unrecognizable either from the bombs or the flame-throwers, and because their bodies were charred or incinerated by the U.S. troops and thrown into plastic bags along with their identification and personal effects. Afterwards, the soldiers threw some of the bodies into the sea, others were buried in common graves....

Some bodies were completely destroyed as they were run over by tanks. Some bodies were found at dawn inside of cars, charred or completely crushed by tanks. There were hundreds of body parts and fragments of human remains stuck to the walls of the houses and buildings that were thrown into plastic bags to which U.S. troops added chemical substances or were simply treated as garbage that was removed with backhoes when they cleared away the rubble two weeks later.

There were bodies in the streets of El Chorrillo for nearly a week. The Red Cross was not permitted to recover bodies of either the wounded or the dead to transport them to the hospitals or the morgues. The U.S. troops also opened fire on the ambulances.

It is for this reason that the massacre of Chorrillo and against Panama must not be permitted to spread throughout Central America and the Caribbean, nor to any other brother country. That is why when we are asked by the giant networks who want to see where the 2,000 to 4,000 bodies are buried, in the first place, we tell them that they should have gone to Panama to give a Christian burial to the pieces of flesh and the gallons of blood that were stuck to the walls of buildings or to the unidentifiable human fragments.

At this distance from the invasion, three and a half months later, we still don't know the precise human toll. Figures range between the official figure of 655 and 4,000. The Independent Commission of Inquiry headed by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark estimated the number at between 2,000 and 4,000. The Vicariate of Darien, Kuna Yala and Colon, together with the Episcopal Conference speak of 3,000 and condemn the difficulties in obtaining information. The Catholic Church maintains that according to a confidential and credible source the toll is 655 dead and 2,000 wounded, but exclude from this count those who burned to death, were cremated, crushed under the rubble, those brought to Gorgas [Hospital], those buried in common graves, and all information from the interior. How many do these exceptions exclude?

In reality, the exact figure is not important. What is important is that they are human beings, our compatriots, and we demand to know who they are and where they are.... In addition, there is the loss of autonomy and independence in the governing of the country. How will this be rectified?

## ANC Activists: Inside the South African Government

Late last year former security policeman Butana Almond Nofamela, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a farmer, believed that speaking about his involvement with South African death squads might save him from execution.

His former police colleagues tried to persuade Nofamela to remain silent, but in November 1989 he decided to talk. Nofamela said he had committed numerous murders at the behest of his police commanders, the most infamous being the 1981 assassination of well-known African National Congress (ANC) lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge. He told his lawyer and a commission of inquiry, in graphic detail, how Mxenge was kidnapped and then stabbed to death.

The disclosures by Nofamela have dispelled any doubts that certain killings in South Africa were the responsibility of independent far right-wingers in the security apparatus – in fact death squads have now been shown to be a direct part of that apparatus.

Nofamela's death row revelations were followed by those of his immediate superior officer, Captain Johannes Dirk Coetzee, and another colleague, David "Spyker" Tshikalanga. After Nofamela's confessions both men fled the country and told their stories to the Afrikaans language newspaper *Vrye Weekblad*.

Later Coetzee did the unthinkable for an Afrikaaner security policeman – he joined the ANC liberation movement – the prime enemy and target of the hit squads. He was followed by his colleague, "Spyker" Tshikalanga and 12 other members of the death squads.

Though Almond Nofamela implicated 17 policemen, the squad which he and Captain Coetzee described was only one of many. Coetzee participated in the hit squad for 15 years, convinced that the murders the group committed would never be proven. "Once you have been pulled into the spider's web, it is difficult to get out, especially when it does its executions so cleanly that it leaves no evidence," he said.

"The responsibility for the death squads goes right to the top," Coetzee said. In an affidavit presented to a government inquiry into the hit squad allegations, Coetzee named all past and present members of the State Security Council as coconspirators. The State Security Council was the power behind the cabinet until the accession of F.W. de Klerk to the Presidency.

In particular, he named the former Law and Order Minister Louis Le Grange, now speaker of parliament, and General Johan Coetzee (no relation), the former chief of police, now retired, as the relevant authorities during the time he was most active.

Coetzee also maintains that in 1982, South African government officials carried out the bombing of the ANC office in London, using a device smuggled into Britain through the diplomatic pouch.

The existence of death squads such as those described by Coetzee should not have been such a surprise. Late last year Mervyn Malan, a defector from the South African Defense Force (SADF), who said that he was a family relation of Defense Minister, General Magnus Malan, claimed the SADF was involved in attacks on anti-apartheid activists inside and outside South Africa.

Malan also said, in an interview with the Dutch Anti-Apartheid Movement in December 1989, that an official in the British Home Affairs Ministry had provided South African soldiers with British passports.

From 1983 to 1985 Mervyn Malan was the leader of a special unit in the South African Army, known as the "special forces reconnaissance command." He said he took part in actions against SWAPO in Namibia and Angola and that special units of the South African Army, dressed as civilians, conducted attacks on activists in South Africa's black townships.

Outside South African borders the army was involved in kidnapping and assassinating exiled ANC members. Commanders of these special units were trained in Israel, Malan said.

The death squads used several different methods in their assassination attempts. Almond Nofamela described how knives, poison, bombs, bullets and kidnapping were used in the secret war against anti-apartheid activists.

Parcel bombs were sent in the front-line states of Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola. In Swaziland and in Mozambique, death squads have kidnapped and shot people, while in Lesotho their methods included the use of parcel bombs, raids, and individual assassinations.

Last year Reverend Frank Chikane, General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, claimed that there had been an attempt to poison him by contaminating his clothing. Shortly thereafter, members of a military hit squad admitted trying to tamper with his luggage. The newspaper *Vrye Weekblad* claimed that the poison had been prepared by the head of the police forensic department. The newspaper then had to contest a legal claim for 1 million Rand in damages.

Evidence has been presented on plans to replace the heart pills of Nelson Mandela's lawyer with tablets designed to induce a heart attack. Operation Apie (Afrikaans for ape) planned to send a baboon fetus to Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu.

### Development of the Hit Squads

Death squad assassinations have a long history in South Africa – anti-apartheid academic Richard Turner was shot in 1978 – but they reached their peak during the 1984-87 rebellion which brought the state of emergency and put troops into the black townships for the first time.

The rise of the hit squads coincided with the development of an alliance between former President P.W. Botha and the South African military. It was based on the so-called "Total Onslaught" philosophy.

According to this doctrine, developed in the mid 1970s, the security forces should develop a "total response" to counter the "total onslaught" by the forces of the ANC and the South African Communist Party (SACP).

In March 1987, Major General Charles Lloyd, chairman of the State Security Council, spoke of the need to "eliminate the revolutionaries" in the townships. The ranks of the "enemy" were small, he said, and had to be identified specifically. The security forces should not eliminate non-revolutionary members of the community "by accident."

While speaking at the Pretoria University Institute for Strategic Studies in 1988, General Malan justified the covert campaign by saying that, "unconventional methods" were needed to achieve South Africa's aims. "Like others we do not talk about them," he added.

During the rebellion of 1984-87 the South African military and police began to work in total cooperation. Joint Management Committees were set up in every township and rural community. These local committees reported to a regional committee, which in turn reported to the National Security Management System (NSMS). The committees and the NSMS coordinated all aspects of the civil administration. The NSMS was controlled by the State Security Council. From this dominant position the State Security Council could completely regulate the civilian administrations. Under the auspices of the Joint Management Committees, troops were brought in to police the townships.

### Police Squads

The Coetzee police squad was directly linked to Security Branch C1 operating out of COMPOL, the police headquarters in Pretoria. Its operations followed a clear pattern of political direction, specifically targeting political or trade union activists.

The Commissioner of Police was the responsible senior official of Coetzee's squad operations, and his superior was the Minister of Law and Order, who sat on the State Security Council and in the Cabinet.

The police squads were based in Pretoria, Cape Town, East London, Durban, Piet Retief (a town used as a base for incursions into Swaziland), at the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) station near Milman, and near Kuruman, at a farm called Vlakplaas and at another one called Daisy.

From Vlakplaas, East London, and Cape Town, the death squads used ANC defectors in the guerrilla war. The police found that as the guerrilla war intensified in the early 1980s, they were able to turn some of the ANC's cadres and began seeking a role for them. The "Askaris" (guerrilla defectors) also worked with a "terrorism detection unit" in Cape Town. The police squads also had dealings with foreign agents. State Security Council member, Craig Williamson acted as liaison between the foreign agents and the death squads. In the 1970s Williamson infiltrated the International University Exchange Fund, which had close links with the anti-apartheid liberation movement. He is now seeking to build an image in South Africa as a reform-minded politician, and his connection with the police squads is proving an embarrassment.

According to evidence from an internal South African Police Departmental inquiry, conducted in 1985, Williamson and Dirk Coetzee had a "close relationship." Williamson spoke of a "close rapport" between them.

### Military Squads

The military death squads came under the command of the CCB (Civil Cooperation Bureau). The CCB charter defined its hit squads – in operation since April 1986 – as a covert unit independent of existing state intelligence and covert structures, charged with gathering intelligence and acting against "aggressors." This ultra-secret group within the SADF operated both inside South Africa and across its borders.

Chief of the SADF, General Jannie Geldenhuys, informed a government inquiry that the unit's annual budget was 28 million Rand last year. Added to this were subsidized cars, houses, medical allowances, and logistical support from other military structures. The CCB had also established a network of front companies to provide cover and to launder money necessary for operations.

The unit's organizers opted to recruit extensively among expolicemen from the Brixton Murder and Robbery squad, a unit with a reputation of brutal policing and with an established network of informers and agents throughout southern Africa. The military also found they had a sudden addition to their Reconnaissance ("Recce") squads of former Rhodesian special forces men – local and foreign mercenaries. These men provided the military with the means and the extra expertise to take the war to the enemy.

There were also strong indications that some of the hit squad personnel involved in the Rhodesian war had connections with Israel, which has specialized in cross-border operations. In the mid 1980s the ANC warned of Mossad-style cross-border assassinations being carried out against it.

The chain of command controlling the activities of the CCB's covert military unit involved a number of generals and led directly to the office of Defense Minister Magnus Malan. Malan said that the first he had heard of CCB's death squad activities was in November 1989, though this was contradicted by senior officers in statements to the official commission. Investigations have shown that, far from being solely an intelligence-gathering operation, the CCB was used for political intimidation, including murder. It was funded by secret monies that involved millions of Rands to cover salaries, expenses and travelling costs and over which there was little control.

The existence of the CCB was officially acknowledged by the SADF in March 1990. The admission came after the arrest of CCB members on suspicion of killing anti-apartheid activists Anton Lubowski and David Webster.

Anton Lubowski was a member of SWAPO's Central Committee. On September 12, 1989, he was assassinated in front of his home in Namibia.

*(Image: SWAPO member Anton Lubowski was murdered by South African death squads. Credit: Impact Visuals)*

In an endeavor to deflect this unwanted attention Defense Minister Malan, a hardline opponent of President de Klerk, attempted to disinform the media and the investigation into Lubowski's murder. Malan claimed, quite suddenly, that his men would have had no reason to kill Lubowski since he had been a military intelligence agent for the South Africans.

David Webster, an academic and human rights activist, was gunned down outside his Johannesburg home on May 1, 1989. He had been working on an analysis of the South African hit squads and had uncovered clandestine links between the Mozambique National Resistance and the South African Army in northern Natal province.

Malan issued a lengthy statement firmly denying he had issued orders for Webster and Lubowski to be killed.

### Commission of Inquiry

For some time pressure for action against hit squads has been intensifying, catalyzed by demands for an independent inquiry into the murders of Webster and Lubowski.

In the furor surrounding the Nofamela and Coetzee confessions, the "reform" government of President F.W. de Klerk agreed to hold an internal inquiry. Then, as pressure increased, Judge Louis Harms was appointed to conduct an independent judicial inquiry into the allegations of killings.

The South African government presented a list of 71 unsolved killings to the Harms Commission. This list did not include cases from outside South Africa, yet it did cite more than just state-sponsored assassinations. It includes ANC operations, either involving the killing of informers or state witnesses, or land-mine and grenade explosions.

This decision appears to have been taken to placate those police and military officers already deeply concerned at the rapid volte-face of the de Klerk government. There has been much dissent among the ranks of the police and military over the unbanning in early February 1990 of their arch-enemies, the ANC and the SACP.

Similarly the decision to exclude the foreign operations of the hit squads was an attempt to prevent this issue from becoming diplomatically embarrassing at a sensitive moment in Pretoria's relations with the outside world.

Because of the narrowness of the Harms Commission brief it will not include: the killing of the academic and journalist Ruth First in Maputo, Mozambique in August 1982; the attempted assassination of Albie Sachs in Maputo in 1988; the assassination of ANC representative Joe Gqabi in Harare, Zimbabwe in August 1981; the killing of Jeannette Schoon in Lubango, Angola in 1984; the killing of Dulcie September, ANC representative in Paris in March 1988; the bomb blast at the London ANC office in the early 1980s; the Shifidi killing in Namibia; in addition to numerous other bombings and assassinations in Harare, Lusaka, Gaborone and Maseru.

The Commission will also not examine the case of Swedish national Heine Human, who was reportedly employed by a South African police unit known as A1. Human was alleged to have been involved in the unsolved 1988 assassination of Dulcie September. Human fled South Africa in December 1989 and is now in the hands of ANC intelligence personnel.

Nor will it look at the direct link which has been established between Pretoria and the 1982 bombing of the ANC's London office. British national and former A1 agent Peter Casselton – jailed in 1982 for burglary and now in South Africa with Interpol searching for him – has acknowledged that he was an A1 agent and that he had been responsible for operations in London.

### Conclusion

President F.W. de Klerk recognized the need to diminish some of the power of the security apparatus, as well as the need to acquire levers of control over some of his military generals who are deeply uneasy about the course he is following.

Although de Klerk has already indicated that he will not react to "trial by media," once the Harms Commission's findings are in, he will most likely fire those generals implicated in the scandal. Or possibly, he will hold the threat of a broader-ranging investigation over their heads as a guarantee of their future loyalty.

de Klerk already has enough evidence to dismiss Defense Minister Magnus Malan, something he has wanted to do for several months. Many believed Malan's career was effectively over before Harms began hearing evidence. But if de Klerk has found a means of reining in his military generals, the same may not be true of their police counterparts.

It appears that the men behind the police death squads have stuck to the requirements for illegal and covert activities: plausible deniability and cut-outs. As yet there is little evidence linking the current roster of police colonels and generals to the Section C hit squads. It seems certain that knowledge of the hit squads went right to the top. A document which indicates that the State Security Council and senior ministers were aware of death squad activity was cited in the South African press in December 1989.

Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha has specifically been accused in the media of knowing about the regional operations of the hit squads – something he strongly denies. Craig Williamson is taking damage-limitation action by admitting that he knew about raids outside the country, but not about death squad killings.

The international focus on police and military hit squad activities has been intense, yet in late April and May 1990 more assassinations and attempted killings took place. A Pan-African Congress member and his family were murdered in Botswana and an Anglican priest with links to the ANC was badly injured by a bomb in Harare, Zimbabwe.

The operations of other squads inside the country are also coming to light. There is now evidence that the Johannesburg City Council operated a spy ring. Allegations were exposed at another government inquiry that its employees worked with Military Intelligence to commit illegal acts of violence, including the burning down of an alleged ANC house in a suburb of Johannesburg.

An average of 11 South African police are now resigning every day and morale is at an all-time low. These police have played a key role in the repression that has propped up apartheid, and many are extremely worried about their future once the system is abolished. But it is clear that neither security apparatus responsible for the death squad activities has been restructured or shut down.

de Klerk may now have achieved two prime objectives; to improve control of his restive security apparatus, and to have pawns with which to bargain with the ANC, trading police hit-men against guerrillas. But anti-apartheid activists fear that with or without overt official approval, the squads will continue to operate.

### Correction:

In issue Number 33 we inadvertently dropped the last line of the article "Elections Under State Terror," by Terry Allen and Edward Herman. The last sentence should read:

> The legitimized government may also kill its citizens freely, if it avoids murdering and mutilating notables, in which case the press may raise questions about whether the "elected government" really "controls" the people who kill.

We would like to apologize both to the authors and to our readers for this omission.

## The Council for National Policy

**by Russ Bellant***

The Council for National Policy (CNP) is a secretive group of the foremost rightwing activists and funders in the United States. Morton Blackwell of the CNP has said, "The policy [of CNP] is that we don't discuss who attends the meetings or what is said." Its membership, meetings, and projects are all secret, even though the group enjoys tax-exempt status. It focuses largely on foreign policy issues. [^1]

The Council actually has two related organizations, the Council on National Policy, the tax-exempt 501(c)3 membership group, and CNP, Inc., a 501(c)4 element set up in 1987. The latter group will allow the parent Council to lobby without jeopardizing its tax-exempt status. Since the CNP maintains a very low visibility, it is likely that members lobbying at the behest of CNP or CNP, Inc. will use the names of other groups with which they are affiliated. [^2]

Individuals pay $2,000 per year to be a member of the CNP. For $5,000, one can become a member of the Council's Board of Governors, which elects the executive committee of CNP. That executive committee then selects the officers on an annual basis. Members of CNP are encouraged to give part of their membership fee to CNP, Inc. [^3]

### Origins of the CNP

The origins of the CNP are not found in mainstream conservatism or the traditional Republican Party, but in the nativist and reactionary circles of the Radical Right, including the John Birch Society (JBS). The view on the Radical Right that an organization such as CNP was needed stemmed from their perception that the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) – closely identified with the Rockefeller family – was selling out American interests in the pursuit of an imagined leftwing foreign policy agenda. This conspiratorial critique was begun in earnest about thirty years ago by the John Birch Society. In 1971, the Society promoted *None Dare Call it Conspiracy*, a book that identified the CFR as pro-communist. [^4]

The New Right played an important role in the 1980 election of President Ronald Reagan and sought to consolidate its gains by expanding its institutional presence in Washington, DC. New Right leaders created the CNP in part to develop alternative foreign policy initiatives to oppose those offered by the Council on Foreign Relations.

The CNP organizes support for confrontational policies long sought by Radical Rightists and ultra-conservative hawks. Support for the "Reagan Doctrine" of so-called "low-intensity" warfare was one outgrowth of this effort. The CNP also addresses domestic social and cultural issues. In many foreign policy matters and domestic issues, the CNP frequently reflects a slick, updated re-packaging of Birch Society philosophy.

The Birch influence on the political goals of the CNP is significant because the JBS was with CNP from the beginning. Nelson Bunker Hunt, a prime mover in CNP's founding, was on the Birch Society's national council. By 1984, John Birch Society Chairman A. Clifford Barker and Executive Council Member William Cies were CNP members. Other JBS leaders also joined the Council. Five board members of Western Goals, essentially a JBS intelligence-gathering operation – and later used to funnel aid to the Nicaraguan contras – joined the CNP as well. [^5]

### The CNP Today

The CNP was founded in 1981 when Tim LaHaye, a leader of Moral Majority, proposed the idea to wealthy Texan T. Cullen Davis. [^6] Davis contacted billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, and from that point on they began recruiting members. By 1984, the Council had 400 members. [^7]

Joe and Holly Coors were early members of the CNP. Their names appear on a 1984 confidential list of members. Also on the list is Lt. Colonel Oliver North, retired generals John Singlaub and Gordon Sumner, and other contra network supporters such as former ambassador Lewis Tambs, Louis (Woody) Jenkins, and Lynn (L. Francis) Bouchey. Sumner, Tambs, Bouchey, and CNP member Frank Aker are also leaders of the Council for Inter-American Security (CIS), a group with ties to the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's far-flung political network. [^8]

The first president of CNP, from 1981-82, was founder Tim LaHaye, a militant anti-humanist who once criticized Michelangelo and Renaissance art for its nude figures, which he claimed were "the forerunner of the modern humanist's demand for pornography...."

LaHaye and others brought together representatives from the Religious Right, the White House, elected officeholders, the political Right, and rightwing businessmen. The CNP's first executive director, Louisiana State Representative Woody Jenkins, told members, "I predict that one day before the end of this century, the Council will be so influential that no President, regardless of party or philosophy, will be able to ignore us or our concerns or shut us out of the highest levels of government." [^9]

*(Image: Paul Weyrich, a reactionary rightist, is an influential member of CNP. Credit: Free Congress Foundation)*

Council members who are willing to discuss the CNP at all describe its main function as a forum for bringing activists and wealthy funders together to plan projects of mutual interest. One member said that the 1985 campaign to pressure Reagan to fire Secretary of State George Shultz (for not being sufficiently supportive of South Africa) began at a CNP meeting. [^10]

Although a former staffer told a Baton Rouge newspaper that Oliver North never directly asked for money, North did make the contras' needs known to CNP members. He addressed their quarterly meetings at least three times in the mid-1980s, once distributing pictures of a Nicaraguan airfield. Ellen Garwood, who was active in the World Anti-Communist League (WACL) and donated funds to the contras, told the congressional Iran/contra committee that she first met Oliver North at a CNP meeting. [^11]

Tom Ellis succeeded LaHaye in 1982 as president of the CNP. Ellis is a top political operative of Jesse Helms, running various political organizations that make up the Helms empire. Ellis was a director of one of the groups which supports the Helms network – the Pioneer Fund, a foundation which financed efforts to prove that African-Americans are genetically inferior to whites. Ellis has said, "The eventual goal of this movement [racial integration] is racial intermarriage and the disappearance of the Negro race by fusing into the white." While Ellis has since disavowed his segregationist position, his associates in the Helms organizational network are still tied to the Pioneer Fund board and receive Pioneer funds. [^12]

Recipients of Pioneer grants have included William Shockley, Arthur Jensen, and Roger Pearson. Pearson has written that "inferior races" should be "exterminated." All three, and others, were funded during Ellis's directorship on the Pioneer board. Ellis served on the CNP's thirteen-member executive committee with Holly Coors, Paul Weyrich, and Heritage Foundation president Edwin Feulner until June 1989. Oliver North and Reed Larson of the anti-union National Right to Work Committee recently joined the executive committee. [^13]

After Ellis's one-year term as president of CNP in 1982-83, he was succeeded by Nelson Bunker Hunt, Pat Robertson, and Richard DeVos of the Amway Corporation. Some of the other board members of the Council for National Policy also have colorful pasts. [^14]

### CNP and the Free Congress Foundation

The Free Congress Foundation (FCF), a key New Right organization working on both domestic and foreign policy issues, has substantial ties to the Council for National Policy. FCF's Connie Marshner and eleven of seventeen of the Free Congress directors are also CNP members. Paul Weyrich is the CNP's Secretary-Treasurer. [^15]

*   Paul Weyrich, established the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, from which evolved the Free Congress Foundation, both political action organizations. Weyrich then established the Heritage Foundation, which functions as a tax-exempt research counterpart to the FCF. He was helped in both these ventures with substantial funding from the Coors Foundation.
*   Connie Marshner has participated in activities of the rightwing evangelical Word of God through the Allies for Renewal. Marshner is on the steering committee of the Coalition on Revival (COR) and the executive committee of Anatole Fellowship. She also works with the National Pro-Family Coalition which operates out of FCF offices.
*   John D. Beckett, President of Intercessors for America (IFA) and, with Connie Marshner, a member of the COR steering committee. Intercessors' newsletters indicate that the group is involved with shepherding discipleship cult leaders, as does Beckett's COR leadership position. The newsletters also express concerns about Freemasonry.

> ### IFA directs supporters to pray for Star Wars and "godly" governments and candidates.

IFA directs supporters to pray for Star Wars and "godly" governments and candidates. IFAers were also encouraged to "Pray for the Pretoria government, especially President Botha and President Reagan...," as well as for the Intercessors branch in South Africa. Beckett is also on the CNP's Board of Governors. IFA has been supported by the Coors Foundation. [^16]

*   Richard DeVos, president of Amway Corporation. Also a member of CNP's executive committee and Board of Governors, DeVos was CNP's president from 1986-88. He was an early backer of behind-the-scenes efforts in the mid-1970s to stimulate the religious Right to make the U.S. "a Christian Republic." Avon Products, in a letter to DeVos rebuffing Amway's attempted takeover of Avon, recently called Amway "morally bankrupt and criminally corrupt," saying also, "Your company is an admitted criminal.... Your corporate culture is marked by zealotry." DeVos also serves on the Chairman's Council of the Conservative Caucus, a group closely allied with rightwing and white supremacist elements in southern Africa. Conservative Caucus_spends much of its efforts aiding these elements. [^17]
*   Thomas A. Roe, one of the fifty-five members of CNP's Board of Governors, and a board member of International Policy Forum (IFP), another group headed by Weyrich. Roe is active in a number of far-Right groups and chairman of the Roe Foundation. [^18]
*   Richard Shoff, owner of Lincoln Log Homes in North Carolina.

Shoff also supports the Conservative Caucus, a group which cheerleads for the apartheid regime in South Africa. Shoff was recently implicated in a questionable fund raising scheme shut down by the Attorney General of Illinois. Funds collected under the name "Children with AIDS Foundation" were slated to support a homophobic rightwing religious activist, Rev. H. Edward Rowe, and a group of private investors, but were allegedly paid to investors and fund raisers, with no funds spent on any actual projects. [^19]

I don't say shoot him.... Somebody ought to do something to make him stop what he's doing." McAlvany said in his letter of complaint that *The Nation* had "attributed to me a most damaging and inaccurate statement, one that does not reflect either my actual views or my complete remarks on the occasion cited."

SOF started in 1975 in sympathy with the racist regime of Rhodesia. In recent years, SOF staff have trained Salvadoran military units in urban warfare. [^29]

While it should not be argued that the CNP is a creation of the Birchers, its very existence is a testament to the success of the JBS goal of creating a rightist counterpoint to established power. The CNP has become a player in mainstream political life in the United States. Ambassadors, prominent public figures such as Milton Friedman, members of Congress and the executive branch have addressed CNP meetings. James Quayle, father of the Vice President, and other key political supporters of Dan Quayle have been nominated for CNP membership, as the Council seeks to expand its influence. [^30]

The CNP continues to selectively expand its membership. Even though Ronald Reagan is no longer president, the far-right remains a powerful force in U.S. politics.

## The Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

**by John Edginton and John Sergeant**

**Editors' Note:** In April 1988, John Edginton, a British independent film maker, began an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Edginton had just completed a film about King's life ("Promised Land") and was intrigued by comments by King's friend, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, that King was murdered by government forces. By January 1989, Edginton had gathered enough evidence disputing the official verdict that BBC Television agreed to fund a documentary: "Who Killed Martin Luther King?" John Sergeant joined the team as associate producer. The film aired in England in September 1989 and on cable television in this country in March 1990. The following article is derived from information gathered in their investigation and raises questions about government complicity in the assassination of the civil rights leader.

### Introduction

Equivocation, uncertainty, and doubt have never been fully dispelled with respect to the untimely death of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. This could be put down in part to the intensity of public suspicion over the killing of President John F. Kennedy. But suspicions linger primarily because of the inherently unconvincing nature of the official version of events.

In an apparently bona fide effort to lay these ghosts to rest, the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded an investigation in 1979 which reaffirmed the guilt of convicted assassin James Earl Ray but conceded the probable existence of a conspiracy behind him – headed by a group of St. Louis businessmen with ties to organized crime. It referred its leads to the Justice Department which quietly closed the case in 1983.

However, new revelations clearly demand official answers. The case should now be reopened and the whole 22-year saga of James Earl Ray's conviction and imprisonment should now be rigorously reviewed.

The first important new revelation involves Jules Ron Kimble, a convicted murderer serving time in a federal prison in Oklahoma. In a recent interview, Kimble admitted being intimately involved in a widespread conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of King. He said that this conspiracy involved agents of the FBI and the CIA, elements of the "mob," as well as Ray. [^1]

Kimble, a shadowy figure with ties to the U.S. intelligence community and organized crime, corroborates much of Ray's self-serving story. He alleges that Ray, though involved in the plot, did not shoot King and was in fact set up to take the fall for the assassination. [^2]

Jules Kimble, in implicating the mob and the CIA in the assassination, claims to have introduced Ray to a CIA identities specialist in Montreal, Canada, from whom Ray gained four principal aliases. In August 1989, a former CIA agent serving in Canada around the time of the King assassination, confirmed that the CIA did indeed have such a false identities specialist operating out of Montreal in the late 1960s. [^3]

An investigation by Dr. Philip Melanson revealed that the identities that Ray adopted during the period of the assassination were far more elaborate than previously realized. Melanson concluded that in at least one instance, Ray's alias could only reasonably have derived from a top secret security file accessible only available to military and intelligence agencies. [^4]

Finally, Ray who has been protesting his innocence for over 20 years, has always claimed that he was set up for the assassination by a mysterious "handler" called Raoul whom he had first encountered in Montreal nine months before. The former CIA agent who served in Canada named the agency's Montreal identities specialist at the time as Raoul Maora. [^5]

> ### In the early 1960s, Kimble was associating with gangsters, segregationists, the FBI and, he forcefully asserts, the CIA.

Jules Ron Kimble cannot be dismissed out-of-hand. For a start he has a long record of mob activity and violence, often with political overtones. He is currently serving a double life sentence in El Reno, Oklahoma, for two murders he admits were political. He has proven links to the Louisiana mob empire of Carlos Marcello (frequently accused of involvement in political assassination) and admits to having done mob-related work in New Orleans, Montreal, and Memphis during the late sixties – three key cities in Ray's odyssey. [^6]

Investigative records from the period confirm Kimble to have been involved with the underworld and the KKK, to have been in Montreal in the summer of 1967, and to have been called in for questioning in connection with the Kennedy assassination by then-New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison. During this questioning, Kimble admitted being linked to the local FBI and CIA and Garrison accepted this admission as true. [^7]

Like his contemporary, Lee Harvey Oswald, Jules Kimble had been living in Crescent City, California during the early 1960s and was associating with gangsters, segregationists, the FBI and, he forcefully asserts, the CIA. He is known to have been in contact with David Ferrie, the dead CIA flier who has been repeatedly implicated in the assassination of John Kennedy. [^8]

Most astonishingly, Jules Ron Kimble is not dismissed out-of-hand by James Earl Ray. When Ray was recently confronted with the alleged connection, he said that Kimble may have been one of two mysterious figures he saw on the afternoon of the assassination but he wasn't sure. Ray then asked if Kimble was in prison (which he was) but rejected Kimble's allegations about their connection as some sort of "government disinformation." [^9]

Although James Earl Ray, now 60, stands convicted of shooting Martin Luther King, most observers agree the truth of what really happened has never been established. New evidence from Kimble, compounded with other recent revelations, establish that the issue is not whether government operatives were involved in the King assassination but rather how high up the chain of command the conspiracy ran.

### The Lone Gunman

In late March 1968, the Rev Martin Luther King Jr. came to Memphis to support the city's striking sanitation workers who were predominantly black. He led a march of 6000 protesters which disintegrated into violence between police and demonstrators, giving conservative forces the opportunity to scorn King's doctrine of nonviolent political struggle. Determined to prove the sanitation workers' protest could be peaceful, King returned to Memphis on April 3rd to lead a second march.

On April 4, a few minutes before 6 p.m., Dr. King walked out on the balcony outside his second-floor room at the Lorraine Motel. He was scheduled to attend a dinner at the local Reverend Billy Kyles's house and was bantering with his chauffeur down in the parking lot below. At 6:01 p.m. there was a shot. A high-velocity dum-dum bullet hit Dr. King in the neck, severing his spinal column and leaving a massive exit hole. One hour later, in St Joseph's Hospital in Memphis, King died.

Public suspicions over the investigation of Dr. King's death surfaced almost immediately. In 1968 there was already a growing body of opinion at odds with the official explanation that Lee Harvey Oswald had been the lone assassin of John F. Kennedy. In Memphis, King too had been shot with a high-velocity rifle, ostensibly from a window. Moreover, like Dallas, the assassination had taken place under the noses of the authorities in broad daylight.

Soon after his murder, questions surrounding the assassination of King began to emerge. How had so many police arrived so quickly on the scene within moments of the shot being fired – yet failed to spot the assassin either arriving or departing? Who, in an apparent attempt to distract police radio control, had broadcast a hoax car chase involving a Mustang on citizens band radio less than half an hour after the police radio announced the suspect car to be a white Mustang? If, as the police claimed, the shot had come from the bathroom window, why did at least three people claim to have seen a gunman in the bushes across the street?

The official scenario of how Ray shot King is as follows: Ray was supposed to have checked into a rooming house on Main Street, the back of which faces the Lorraine Motel; established a sniper's post in the bathroom; shot Martin Luther King; panicked and dropped his belongings on the sidewalk as he fled the rooming house, leaving the rifle to be discovered with his fingerprints on it; and then raced out of Memphis in a white Mustang.

Suspicions of a conspiracy in the murder of King did not diminish with the capture of Ray, though officials continued to maintain he was a lone assassin. On the contrary, expectations of major revelations at Ray's forthcoming trial were very high. But these expectations were never gratified. The public was kept ignorant of the many anomalies and peculiarities in the case, some of which were even ignored by investigators.

The most prominent of these inconsistencies in the state's case was the self-contradictory and inconsistent testimony of its chief witness, Charlie Stephens. Stephens, who the state claims saw Ray emerging from the bathroom, did not recognize Ray in a photo he was shown shortly after the assassination. The state also failed to mention that Stephens was an alcoholic and was drunk the afternoon of the King murder.

### Why Did Ray Plead Guilty?

It has never been established where the idea of Ray's guilty plea originated but certain facts stand out. Ray's lawyers in the original trial were Hugh Stanton Sr., the Shelby County Public Defender and Percy Foreman. It is interesting to note that earlier Stanton had acted as lawyer to Charlie Stephens – the prosecution's chief witness. No one in the judicial system, however, saw his acting as Ray's attorney as a conflict of interest.

In December 1967, Foreman proposed to prosecutor Phil Canale that Ray could be convinced to plead guilty in exchange for a slightly reduced sentence and no death penalty. Canale was favorable to the idea and consulted with the King family lawyer, Harry Wachtel (former Governor of Tennessee), officials at the Justice Department, and finally the Attorney General. Everyone agreed that the guilty plea was a splendid idea. It was Foreman's job to convince Ray. [^10]

Ray would have none of it. And it took more than two months for him to cave in, despite all manner of tactics employed to pressure him and his family into agreeing. Foreman even assured Ray in a letter that there was a 100% chance he would be found guilty and a 99% chance of the electric chair (even though the state's case was very weak and no one had gone to the chair in Tennessee in more than a decade). Ray also discovered he could not change his lawyer again and that Foreman was doing nothing to develop a defense. Finally Ray somehow believed that if he pleaded guilty he could dismiss Foreman, demand a new lawyer, and receive a new trial. [^11]

The so-called trial took place suddenly on March 10, 1968 and following a lengthy list of charges the state would have tried to prove, Ray pleaded guilty as arranged and was sentenced to 99 years. He immediately petitioned for a new trial, which was denied, and has been petitioning on every conceivable ground ever since, also to no avail.

In 1974, however, Ray succeeded in prying from the state an evidentiary hearing. The hearing was to determine whether Ray had enough grounds for a new trial based on his being negligently represented by attorney Percy Foreman. Harold Weisberg, a veteran of the John Kennedy case and a writer, was taken on as an investigator on Ray's legal team.

### Major Inconsistencies in the State's Evidence

Weisberg's investigation was a searching and vigorous one. Although he differs with many experts in his conclusions – he believes Ray to be totally innocent, a fall guy or "patsy" – many of his arguments about the weakness of the official case and the existence of a conspiracy remain persuasive to this day. Through his relentless pursuit of FBI documentation under the Freedom of Information Act, Weisberg found many documents which revealed numerous irregularities in the Bureau's investigation. Among other inconsistencies, the state's examination of the alleged murder weapon is very revealing.

An internal FBI report on the bullet which killed King said that it was too mangled to compare against the rifle that allegedly fired it. The report states that "...its deformation and absence of clear cut marks precluded a positive determination." Yet the evidence presented at Ray's "trial" gave the impression that the "death slug" was proven to have been fired from the rifle. [^12]

Weisberg consulted with a ballistics expert who examined the bullet and concluded that there were indeed sufficient markings on it to make test-fire comparisons. The ballistics expert is adamant about the fact that the FBI could and should have carried out such tests. [^13]

*(Image: Martin Luther King Jr. -new evidence strongly suggests he was killed by members of the U.S. government. Credit: Ray Lustig)*

One of Weisberg's most powerful arguments concerns the crime scene itself. How, he wonders, did the assassin, who would have had to stand in a bathtub to fire at King, manage to take a single shot, run from the bathroom into the bedroom, bundle up the rifle and a bizarre collection of personal belongings in a blanket (ensuring that the belongings but not the bathroom or the bedroom had his fingerprints on them), run the length of the rooming house, down a flight of stairs, dump the bundle in the street, walk calmly to his waiting Mustang and drive away within the one to two minutes it took uniformed officers to reach the same location?

Official records as to precisely what took place on the street outside the rooming house – Main Street, one block west of the motel – in those critical minutes, are astonishingly chaotic. At Ray's trial in 1969, testimony was given by Inspector N.E. Zachary of the Memphis Police Department that he found the rifle and the bundle first. By the time of the 1974 evidentiary hearings (after various books had researched the question), the state conceded that another officer, Sheriff's Deputy Bud Ghormley was first to discover the bundle.

Yet Ghormley, in turn, has been contradicted by Sheriff's Deputy Vernon Dollahite. Dollahite, now chief of detectives, insisted that he was the first onto Main Street and first to see the bundle. Dollahite has been consistent in his story from the beginning. After one of his early FBI interviews, they calculated that the time he took from the shot being fired to his arrival on Main Street was 1 minute 57 seconds.

The extraordinary factor in Dollahite's testimony is that though alert for anything unusual as he raced around the corner onto Main Street, he not only missed the Mustang pulling away, he did not even see the bundle with the rifle in it. Only after he had entered Jim's Grill beneath the rooming house, told everyone to stay put, and come out again, did he spot it lying in a doorway a few yards away. He and the FBI agreed that whomever was about to dump the bundle had probably seen him coming, hidden behind the staircase door until he had gone into the grill, then run out onto the street throwing down the bundle while Deputy Dollahite was inside.

There is an obvious problem with this scenario. How could Ray run out of the doorway, throw down the incriminating bundle, and then manage to climb into a white Mustang and drive off unnoticed within the seconds it took Dollahite to emerge from Jim's Grill just feet away?

The judge at the evidentiary hearing took more than a year to conclude that Ray had no grounds for a retrial. The defendant's guilt or innocence was immaterial to the issue at hand, he said.

### Spying on King

By 1977, with the revelations by the Church Committee of major abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies, public opinion about the political assassinations of the 1960s had reached such heights that Congress was forced into forming the House Select Committee on Assassinations to investigate the murders of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.

Beset with political problems and threats to its funding, the HSCA nonetheless did manage to address, if inconclusively and frequently inadequately, the majority of the issues and points raised by critics of the official story in the King case. Its final report dated March 29, 1979 concluded that James Earl Ray was indeed guilty of killing Martin Luther King Jr. but that there had been co-conspirators after all. An informant's report in the FBI's St. Louis office, previously overlooked, led to the discovery that a $50,000 bounty for the death of Martin Luther King Jr. had been offered in that city in 1967. [^14]

However, blaming the King assassination on a conspiracy of St. Louis organized crime figures, with Ray acting as the killer, leaves many disturbing questions unanswered. One of these questions is, how could Ray simply walk into a predominantly black section of Memphis teeming with police, informants, and undercover agents, shoot King and then leave unmolested? The extent of the police surveillance on King was remarkable and the notion that Ray shot King and escaped undetected is even more remarkable. Recently, the true nature and extraordinary extent of the official presence in Memphis in April 1968 became clear.

> ### Retired Memphis police officer Sam Evans confirmed that King's chauffeur and the manager of the Lorraine Motel were paid police informants.

Retired Memphis police officer Sam Evans confirmed that King's chauffeur and the manager of the Lorraine Motel were paid police informants. It is also known that Marrell McCollough, one of the first to reach King's fallen body, although ostensibly a member of the radical black group, the Invaders, was in fact an undercover agent of the Memphis Police Department. [^15]

The so-called Intelligence Unit of the Memphis Police Department (MPD) had been planting bugs and agents at all the strategy meetings of the sanitation workers and the Invaders. Nevertheless, they continue to deny having had any source, human or electronic, at the heart of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) (the group King headed) that day. A senior police officer claimed that military intelligence and the U.S. Secret Service had also deployed agents throughout Memphis. [^16]

It is now known that a member of the SCLC and leaders of the local NAACP were in the pay of the FBI. And another figure close to the SCLC – Jay Richard Kennedy – had been reporting his fears of communist control over King to the CIA. [^17]

Despite the presence of numerous people engaged in the surveillance of King, apparently not one of them spotted the assassin arriving, shooting Dr. King, or escaping the scene. Given that the Memphis Police Department had in the past provided extensive security for Dr. King on previous visits and was aware of the vulnerability of the Lorraine Motel, it seems incredible that a contingent of police bodyguards assigned to King on his arrival should have been removed the day of the shooting, apparently without the knowledge of the police chief, Frank Holloman.

Just two hours before the assassination the MPD's patrolling "TAC Units," each comprising three cars, were pulled back five blocks from the vicinity of the Lorraine Motel. Police chief Holloman claimed that he did not know of that decision until afterwards. Inspector Sam Evans, who was in charge of the units, denied that they were pulled back, even though it is now an acknowledged matter of public record. [^18]

Furthermore, immediately after the shooting, no "All Points Bulletin" was issued which might have ensured that the major escape routes out of Memphis were sealed. No satisfactory explanation has ever been provided for that failure.

In another bizarre incident, on the day of the assassination, an erroneous message was delivered by a Secret Service agent to the Memphis Police headquarters stating that there had been a death threat against a black police detective. The detective, Ed Redditt, was stationed at a surveillance post next to the Lorraine Motel. Shortly after the first message, a corrected message arrived saying that the threat was a hoax but the police intelligence officer who received it nevertheless, went to where Detective Redditt was stationed and ordered him to go home. This was two hours before the assassination. Why did the intelligence officer send Redditt home even though he knew the threat to be false? When we approached the officer, who has now left the police force, he refused to be interviewed. [^19]

Some of these circumstances are explained by the police as a series of coincidences, errors, and oversights. Some are not explained at all. While the HSCA's final report fell short of accusing the police of complicity in the assassination, it lambasted the Memphis Police Department for incompetence and latent racism.

Perhaps the HSCA's final conclusion would have been different if it had obtained undoctored intelligence reports from the Memphis Police Department. While doing research for his book "*The Murkin Conspiracy*", Philip Melanson, obtained an MPD intelligence report regarding the King assassination. When he compared it to the same report published by the HSCA, he found that all the footnotes and most of the references to undercover police agents in Memphis had been deleted from the HSCA version. Numerous paragraphs were missing and certain sentences were rewritten to play up the violent nature of Memphis civil rights activists and strikers. [^20]

Why didn't the HSCA get the originals? When confronted with this discrepancy, Representative Louis Stokes (Dem.-Ohio), the former Chair of the HSCA, admitted that he did not know that the Memphis Police Department had provided the Committee with altered documents. [^21]

### The Role of the FBI

It is also enlightening to look at FBI actions both prior to and after the King assassination. Former Atlanta FBI agent Arthur Murtagh has given some indication of the prevailing mood at the Bureau in King's home city.

Murtagh related in an interview that "Me and a colleague were checking out for the day when the news came over the radio that Dr. King had been shot. My colleague leapt up, clapped his hands and said 'Goddamn, we got him! We finally got him.'" When asked if he was sure of this statement, Murtagh was adamant that his colleague said "we,” not "they." [^22]

For years, through its COINTELPRO operations, the FBI had been spying on, bugging, falsifying letters, and sowing discontent among the leadership of the SCLC in an attempt to discredit and "neutralize" Dr. King. [^23]

Suddenly, after the King assassination, the FBI began what was called the greatest, most expensive inquiry in Bureau history – the hunt for King's killer. All the technical and human resources of Hoover's FBI focused on the bundle of evidence conveniently left behind at the crime scene – a bundle which pointed only to one man – Eric Galt, a.k.a. John Willard, a.k.a. Paul Bridgman, a.k.a. George Sneyd, whose real name is James Earl Ray. At the same time, white racist groups braced themselves for an FBI assault, but to their astonishment no one asked them any questions. "It was strange," recalled white supremacist J.B. Stoner, "[It was] almost as if they knew they didn't have to look this way." [^24]

The HSCA, like the Justice Department which had already conducted an investigation into the FBI's handling of the King assassination, found no evidence of a coverup. In the end, the Committee did conclude that the Bureau had contributed to a moral climate conducive to the murder of Dr. King, but it stopped short of accusing the Bureau of actual involvement in the killing. [^25]

*(Image: Myron Billett said he heard U.S. intelligence agents propose the King assassination to Mafia leaders. Credit: S. McCarthy)*

Evidence nonetheless exists suggesting that elements within the FBI may have played a significant role in the political assassination. Consider, for instance, Myron Billett's story.

In early 1968, Myron Billett was the trusted chauffeur of Mafia chief Sam Giancana. Giancana asked Billett to drive him, and fellow mobster Carlos Gambino, to a meeting at a motel in upstate New York. Other major Mafia figures from New York were there as well as three men who were introduced as representatives from the CIA and FBI. There were a number of subjects on the agenda, including Castro's Cuba. [^26]

According to Billett, one of the government agents offered the mobsters a million dollars for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Billett stated that Sam Giancana replied, "Hell no, not after you screwed up the Kennedy deal like that." As far as Billett knows, no one took up the offer.

Billett relayed this information in an interview conducted just weeks before he died of emphysema. Given his condition, there appears to be no particular reason for him to lie. While his allegations are mentioned in the HSCA's final report, it makes no judgment as to their validity – the HSCA report simply states that it was unable to corroborate his story.

There is another instance in which FBI agents were heard discussing bounties and the recruitment of professionals to kill King. In September 1965, Clifton Baird, a Louisville, Kentucky policeman was informed by fellow officer Arlie Blair of a $500,000 offer to kill Dr. King. Louisville was the home of King's brother, the Reverend A.D. King. Baird said he overheard other police officers and several FBI officers discussing the contract. The next day, Baird tape-recorded Blair referring to the contract again. Later, the HSCA heard the tape and verified its authenticity. [^27]

FBI agent William Duncan, liaison with the Louisville Police, admitted that the discussion had taken place and named two other agents who would confirm it. But he also claimed the offer was initiated as a joke by police Sergeant William Baker. Both of the other FBI agents denied any knowledge of the conversation and Baker had died. The HSCA ran out of leads. [^28]

> ### In September 1965, FBI agents were heard discussing bounties and the recruitment of professionals to kill King.

There are also witnesses afraid to discuss what really happened on the day of the assassination due to continuing harassment and intimidation. For example, ever since a black Tennessee grocery store owner named John McFerren first told his story, he has been threatened, burgled, beaten up, and shot at. Now he is very reluctant to tell it again. [^29]

On the afternoon of the assassination, McFerren was at a Memphis produce store when he overheard the store's manager say on the phone "Get him on the balcony, you can pick up the money from my brother in New Orleans and don't call me here again." The man on the phone was Frank Liberto. His brother, Sal, who lived in New Orleans, was associated with Mafia kingpin Carlos Marcello. As incredible as it seems, the FBI did not pursue McFerren's allegation after they initially questioned Liberto and he denied it.

These connections, and other evidence that members of the Mob were involved in the assassination, were discovered by investigative reporter Bill Sartor. While doing research for a book, Sartor had gone undercover and infiltrated the peripheries of both the Memphis and the New Orleans Mafia. Sartor died mysteriously in Texas as he was completing his first draft and two autopsies failed to reveal the cause of death.

There are other Memphis locals, particularly in the vicinity of the Lorraine Motel and Jim's Grill, who are still afraid to talk or who have suddenly changed their original stories. At least one of them is still visited from time to time by a man reminding him to stay silent. There is also the allegation that someone posing as an advance security person appeared at the Lorraine Motel two days before the assassination and ordered Dr. King's room changed from the ground floor to the first. Finally there was the known presence in Memphis on the day of the assassination as well as a week after, of a notorious anti-Castro mercenary and CIA contract employee. Years later, when questioned about why he was in Memphis on the day of the assassination, he admitted "it was my business to be there."

### The CIA and False Identities

It is not disputed that the CIA took a very active interest in Martin Luther King Jr. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal an extensive and ongoing CIA scrutiny of the thoughts, actions, and associates of the civil rights leader throughout the 1960s. One of those reporting back to the CIA was Jay R. Kennedy, a writer and broadcaster prominent in the civil rights movement. Kennedy fervently believed that King's opposition to the war in Vietnam was orchestrated by Peking-line communist agents.

There are other compelling questions about the complicity of the CIA in the King assassination. For example, although James Earl Ray never visited Toronto before April 1968, he used four identities belonging to individuals living within a few miles of each other in that city. Each of the four bears a rough physical resemblance to Ray. Of these the most elaborate alias was that of Eric Galt, a name Ray used extensively through the period before the assassination. Only on April 4th, the day of the assassination, did he abandon Galt's name and begin to use the other three. [^30]

The Galt alias was not merely the result of a fraudulently obtained birth certificate – it was the wholesale usurping of the real Eric Galt's history and physical identity. Evidence shows that James Earl Ray had travelled in the same U.S. cities as the Canadian Eric Galt, had access to Galt's signature, and even inquired into emigrating to southern Africa – a place where Eric Galt had relatives. [^31] Moreover Ray has scars on his forehead and his hand, as does the real Eric Galt. Two months before the assassination Ray had plastic surgery on his nose. Galt revealed that he, too, had had plastic surgery on his nose.

*(Image: Eric Galt discussing how Ray might have gotten information from his classified personnel file. Credit: S. McCarthy)*

Eric Galt is, moreover, an expert marksman.

The question arises: How could Ray or his co-conspirators acquire such a detailed profile of this alter ego? According to Eric Galt, there is only one place where all the pertinent information is collected together – his highly classified security clearance file in the Union Carbide factory in Toronto where, in the mid-1960s, he was working on a top secret U.S. defense project. [^32]

Fletcher Prouty, a former Pentagon colonel and author of "The Secret Team," was responsible for providing military support for CIA covert operations in the early 1960s. Prouty finds these revelations highly significant: [^33]

> The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) [which at that time included the Canadian equivalent of the CIA] would have compiled this file and besides them and Union Carbide, the only people with access to it would have been U.S. intelligence.

The question of how Ray came to acquire these identities provided the original link to Jules Ron Kimble, the man who has confessed to us that he aided Ray in the assassination.

### Who is Raoul?

Ray claims that the mysterious "Raoul" hired him to carry out assignments in Montreal in late July 1967. This sparked an interest in *Toronto Star* reporter Andre Salwyn, who sought corroboration to this claim after Ray's arrest. Salwyn conducted an exhaustive search of the neighborhood in which Ray had allegedly been seen drinking with an American stranger. He found that there had indeed been a man with similar characteristics to Ray's description of Raoul living there at different times during the previous year. He was known as Jules "Ricco" Kimble and was said by his girlfriend to have had a car with rifles in the trunk and a radio tuned into the police band. Salwyn checked phone records and discovered that Kimble regularly contacted numbers in New Orleans. [^34]

But the phone numbers disappeared, and Salwyn was never allowed to pursue the story. The HSCA did manage to come across Kimble ten years later and they investigated. They found an FBI file on him; and a CIA file; and an RCMP file. Joe Oster, a Louisiana state investigator, conducted extensive surveillance of Kimble in 1967, and claims that there is a week in July 1967 when nobody can account for Kimble's whereabouts. [^35] This is the period in which Ray claims to have met "Raoul" in Montreal.

When interviewed in 1967, Kimble claimed to have been a low-level CIA courier and pilot. [^36] When we talked to him from prison, Kimble confirmed that he had worked for the CIA as well as organized crime and also made the following allegations: [^37]

*   He claims that the HSCA did know all about his role in the assassination (more even than he could remember), producing documents, photographs, and files which proved his association with James Earl Ray, an association he then admitted. However, all files relating to the HSCA investigation have been sealed for 50 years.
*   Kimble also stated that on the orders of a Louisiana FBI agent, he flew James Earl Ray from Atlanta to Montreal in July 1967 where Ray was provided with an identities package by a CIA specialist in Mont Royal, Montreal. An ex-CIA agent with knowledge of Agency operations in Canada in the 1960s recently confirmed in an off-the-record interview that there was an Agency "asset" specializing in "identities" in Montreal in 1967. His name was Raoul Maora.
*   Kimble said that he then accompanied Ray to a CIA training camp in Three Rivers, Canada where Ray was taught to shoot. It was there that the two men were seen together by Kimble's former girlfriend.
*   At the same time, an assassination team was assembled to kill King. Kimble claims that he flew two snipers into Memphis using a West Memphis airfield belonging to a CIA front company. He said that the only involvement that Ray had in the assassination was to serve as a decoy.
*   Finally, Jules Kimble stated that elements of the Memphis Police Department did cooperate in the assassination but that the actual operation was coordinated by a high-ranking intelligence official based in Atlanta.

What is the validity of Kimble's assertions? The evidence presented here, and the many questions it raises, suggests one thing: Those responsible for the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. have yet to be caught and convicted of this political assassination. There is strong evidence that shows agents within the U.S. intelligence apparatus could have played a major role in King's murder. If that is the case, then the U.S. government could be guilty of not only covering up details of the assassination, but of the murder itself. The only way to answer these questions is through a complete and thorough investigation. The documents from the HSCA should be unsealed and a new probe begun. It is long past time for that to happen.

## A Violation of International Law: The U.S. Invades Panama

**by Howard Friel***

Because it is almost always illegal for a state to use force in the conduct of its international relations, official disinformation on the legality of U.S. aggression has proven to be an indispensable companion to U.S. assault forces from Vietnam to Panama. The unilateral interpretation of international law by U.S. officials has become as much an "institution" of U.S. foreign policy as the use of force itself. Given the predictable capitulation to the Executive Branch by the media and Congress, it is left to the general public to practice what Noam Chomsky calls "intellectual self-defense." One component of the "self-defense" program is having a sense of when force is permitted or prohibited under international law and when the actions of elected U.S. officials are legal or criminal.

### Two Interpretations of International Law

During the Vietnam War, two important interpretations of international law were put forward: one by the U.S. State Department in a memorandum entitled, "The Legality of United States Participation in the Defense of Vietnam;" another by the Consultative Council of the Lawyers Committee on American Policy Towards Vietnam (hereafter referred to as the U.S. Lawyers), which published a comprehensive rebuttal of the State Department Memorandum. [^1] A review of the two interpretations reveals a disagreement over the legal resort to force that exists today along nearly identical lines.

Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter as a "Prohibition" or a "Limitation" on the Use of Force? The State Department argued that Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter "imposed an important limitation on the use of force by United Nations Members." The U.S. Lawyers argued that 2(4) is not a "limitation" on force but "the keystone to modern international law" and, as such, "outlaws" the use of force as a foreign policy option. Likewise, most scholars of international law recognize 2(4) not as a "limitation" but as a "prohibition" on force. To cite one example, former President of the World Court, Eduardo Jimenez de Arechaga, wrote that:

> ...the paramount commitment of the [U.N.] Charter is Article 2, paragraph 4, which prohibits the threat or use of force in international relations. This is the cardinal rule of international law and the cornerstone of peaceful relations among states. [^2]

Note that Jimenez describes 2(4) as a "prohibition" on force, "the paramount commitment" of the Charter, and "the cardinal rule of international law." In contrast, the State Department's interpretation of 2(4), which established a precedent for a succession of U.S. assaults from Indochina to Panama, demonstrates that the "limitation" interpretation permits the use of force in a number of scenarios, a development that hardly reflects the intent of this cardinal rule with regard to either limiting or prohibiting force.

Force as an Instrument of the World Community or the Nation-State? The U.S. Lawyers acknowledged that the U.N. Charter stipulates "for the very purpose of maintaining peace, various measures, and ultimately force may be required." However, the U.S. Lawyers argued that the Charter "confers the competence to use force upon the Security Council, thus making force the instrument of the world community, and not of individual states." Thus, it is the world community represented by the Security Council that "decides what measures shall be taken" with regard to force. The U.S. Lawyers argued that "the essential meaning of this rule of international law [Article 39] is that no country shall decide for itself whether to use force – and, especially, whether to wage war through an intervention in a foreign conflict." The World Court in *Nicaragua v. United States* (1986) ruled similarly (in rejecting U.S. claims that its attacks against Nicaragua were justified through collective defense with El Salvador) by stating that "there is no rule in customary international law permitting another State to exercise the right of collective self-defense on the basis of its own assessment of the situation."

Article 51 as the Single, Narrow Exception to 2(4) or as Superseding 2(4)? The State Department argued that Article 51 is a "saving clause" designed "to make clear that no other provision in the Charter [including 2(4)] shall be interpreted to impair the inherent right of self-defense referred to in Article 51." The U.S. Lawyers argued that:

> The right of self-defense under the Charter arises only if an "armed attack" has occurred. The language of Article 51 is unequivocal on this point. The term "armed attack" has an established meaning in international law. It was deliberately employed in the Charter to reduce drastically the discretion of states to determine for themselves the scope of permissible self-defense both with regard to claims of individual and collective self-defense.

Thus, the resort to force in self-defense may be employed "only in the event that the victim state experiences an 'armed attack,' that is, if military forces cross an international boundary in visible, massive, and sustained form," where, in the words of Daniel Webster, "the necessity for action [is] instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation." Webster's description of the permissible basis for self-defense was relied upon in the Nuremberg Judgment in the case against major German war criminals.

Contrary to what the State Department claimed, "Article 51 purposely restricted the right of self-defense to a situation of armed attack because only these situations require immediate military reaction to avoid disaster. The rationale is persuasive: other forms of aggression, especially indirect aggression, are so difficult to define and to ascertain, that too many situations might occur in which states, in good faith or bad, would claim the right of self-defense and thereby expand and intensify warfare."

For its part, the State Department cited the U.N. Charter's restrictions on individual and collective defense as "legalistic." The U.S. Lawyers responded: "The correct delimitation of the concept of self-defense is not a 'legalistic' question.... The question of life and death of many innocent victims of war may be contingent upon it – and perhaps, ultimately, the very survival of mankind. It therefore warrants the closest attention."

Collective Self-Defense as a Right of a State Under Armed Attack or as the "Inherent" Right of an Intervening State? In 1966 with South Vietnam against North Vietnam, the U.S. justified its invasion of Vietnam by citing its "inherent" right to collective self-defense. The U.S. Lawyers argued that, as the U.S. invasion of Vietnam showed, a claim to an "inherent" right to intervene in foreign conflicts "may lead to the destruction of the assisted party, as well as to the widening of the local conflicts" and that, "It is to prevent such developments that Judge Jessup argues against interference by outside powers in such situations." Philip C. Jessup, former Judge at the World Court, wrote:

> It would be disastrous to agree that every State may decide for itself which of the two contestants is in the right and may govern its conduct according to its own decision. The ensuing conflict... would be disruptive to the ordered world community which the Charter and any modern law of nations must seek to preserve.

Although the State Department's memorandum on Vietnam claims that "Article 51 restates and preserves... a long-recognized...inherent right of self-defense,” the U.S. Lawyers wrote that the memorandum "fails to cite any rule of general international law, or to establish any precedent to validate the 'inherent' right of outside states to participate in foreign conflicts."

Furthermore, the U.S. Lawyers wrote that "collective self-defense" is not found in writings on international law before the United Nations era, a fact difficult to square with the claim that collective self-defense is an "inherent" right of an intervening state.

The U.S. Lawyers also cited the argument of Hans Kelsen, who wrote in 1950 in *Law of the United Nations*, that: "It is hardly possible to consider the right or duty of a non-attacked state to assist an attacked state as an inherent' right, that is to say, a right established by natural law." Likewise, Julius Stone argued in *Legal Controls of International Conflict*, that "Under general international law, a state has no right of 'self-defense' in respect to an armed attack on a third state."

The post-Vietnam failure in the media and Congress to develop the U.S. Lawyers' interpretation of international law has permitted government officials to resort to force repeatedly without serious domestic challenge. A brief review of the military and disinformation campaigns of the Reagan-Bush era further underscores this point.

### The U.S. Bombing of Libya

On April 5, 1986, at a West Berlin nightclub, LaBelle, a bomb exploded that killed two people – a U.S. serviceman and a Turkish woman – and injured over 200. Several days later, on April 14, while stating that the West Berlin bombing had taken place at the direction of Libya's leader, Muammar Qaddafi, the United States, in an act of reprisal, bombed Libya's two main cities, Tripoli and Benghazi, killing hundreds and wounding several hundred more.

In a nationally televised broadcast, President Reagan stated that the U.S. bombing of Libya was a legal action:

> When our citizens are abused or attacked anywhere in the world, on the direct orders of a hostile regime, we will respond, so long as I'm in this Oval Office. Self-defense is not only our right, it is our duty. It is the purpose behind the mission undertaken tonight – a mission fully consistent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.

Despite the President's claim, it is clear that the U.S. attack against Libya was not a legal act of self-defense, but a violent reprisal for a terrorist act, allegedly instigated by Libya. The basis for reprisal is "to injure others" as a "response to injury suffered." In this case, the U.S. injured Libya (by bombing Tripoli and Benghazi) in response to injury allegedly inflicted by Libya. Thus, an act of reprisal needs to be differentiated from self-defense – the defense of national territory from "armed attack."

Regarding the legality of reprisals, the Consultative Council of the Lawyers Committee on American Policy Towards Vietnam wrote that "violent reprisals have been for a long time regarded with skepticism as they have so frequently involved the imposition of the will of powerful states upon weak states. International law increasingly restricted the right of reprisal even before World War I." The U.S. Lawyers wrote further that the Security Council has "consistently upheld" the prohibition on military reprisals. In April 1964, referring to British raids against Yemen as a reprisal to Yemenese attacks on the British Protectorate of Aden, the U.N. Security Council condemned "reprisals as incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations."

In the preceding debate, U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson "emphasized United States disapproval of retaliatory raids, wherever they occur and by whomever they are committed." And the World Court ruled in the *Corfu Channel* case (1949) that "from the nature of things" reprisals involving military measures "would be reserved for the most powerful states, and might easily lead to perverting the administration of international justice itself."

The U.S. bombing was also illegal in that it did not fulfill the requirements of article 39 of the U.N. Charter, which provides legal authority to the Security Council, not the United States, to "decide what measures shall be taken" in the event of a breach of the peace. Due to its unilateral action, the United States may have retaliated against the party not responsible for the bombing, since it was reported later that Syria, not Libya, was responsible for the LaBelle bombing.

### The U.S. Invasion of Panama

Given the U.S. Lawyers' interpretation of international law, the U.S. invasion of Panama was also illegal. There are no provisions in the law that permit invasion to stop drug smuggling or to remove heads of state. In addition, the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977 provide for the peaceful Settlement of Disputes (Article 14) and prohibit U.S. military intervention in the Principle of Nonintervention (Article 5).

The fact that a U.S. military official was killed by the Panamanian military, after months of intimidation by U.S. military forces, in the streets of Panama City, does not justify a U.S. invasion that killed several hundred, probably thousands, of Panamanians. As Alfred Rubin of the Fletcher School of Law wrote, a U.S. invasion on this count was not justified "...just as the 'rights' of foreigners to walk the streets of New York City do not justify foreign governments sending their own soldiers to keep order against American muggers or overzealous American police." [^3]

In 1946, The Judgment of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg declared that "The [Nuremberg] Charter makes the planning or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties a crime" and that "those who plan and wage such a war... are committing a crime in so doing." Given the illegality of the U.S. invasion of Panama, as the Chief Executive who ordered and approved the invasion, George Bush is at least as much an international criminal as Manuel Noriega.

## U.S. Overt Intervention: Nicaraguan "Electoral Coup"

**by William I. Robinson***

**Editors' Note:** This article, the second part of two, details the U.S. government's intervention into the recent Nicaraguan elections. The first part was published in CAIB Number 33 and is still available to interested readers.

U.S. policy makers gloated over the February 25, 1990 electoral results in Nicaragua, hailing them as a "victory for democracy." However, U.S. intervention in the Nicaraguan electoral process, both public and "private," covert and "overt," constituted one of the most sophisticated and extensive foreign operations launched to date by the Bush administration.

The Bush administration's involvement in the Nicaraguan elections can only be understood in the context of the U.S. government's ten-year war against Nicaragua. The U.S. effort to destroy the Nicaraguan revolution brought military, economic, political, diplomatic and ideological pressure against the Nicaraguan people. The goal of this "war of attrition" was to undermine the revolution as a viable political alternative and to break the Nicaraguan people's will to resist. [^1] The electoral results represent the culmination of this decade-long campaign.

Under Reagan, the key to the war was military aggression led by the contras. Nicaragua's national defense effort eventually defeated the contras on the battlefield, but this victory came at an expense of immeasurable damage to the social and economic fabric of society. The contra war left over 60,000 killed and wounded and some $15 billion in economic damage. These were staggering losses for a small country of barely 3.5 million people and an annual GNP of $2 billion. [^2]

The grueling economic crisis was the price Nicaragua paid to defeat the contras. The need to defend the nation also bore a high political cost for the Sandinistas, who were forced to implement an unpopular military draft. It was these two issues – harsh economic conditions and the draft – which U.S. strategists manipulated into the electoral coup.

The Bush administration, recognizing that continued use of the contras was not viable, moved to shift the front line of battle from the military to the internal political field. As the electoral process began, the U.S. goal was clear: to "harvest" the discontent generated by economic and social hardships brought about by ten years of war by converting war-induced exhaustion into electoral support for an alternative to the Sandinistas. The administration focused on three areas:

*   Massive political and material intervention in the electoral process, including direct participation in the formation of the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO). The U.S. provided overt and covert support for UNO as well as political training for its leaders. It helped design UNO's campaign strategy and provided overall guidance for the anti-Sandinista forces. Through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the U.S. spent no less than $12.5 million for these activities. The CIA contributed another $11 million, although evidence suggests that the amounts are much greater. [^3]
*   Undermining the Sandinistas' economic recovery program. State Department official Bernard Aronson admitted after the elections that Secretary of State James Baker had dedicated "a fair amount of personal intervention" to block Western European aid, considered crucial to the success of the recovery program, during the electoral process. Violeta Chamorro was billed as the savior who could alleviate the suffering of Nicaraguans by mending things with the U.S. and attracting millions of dollars in reconstruction money, just as Seaga was packaged by the CIA in Jamaica in 1980. Bush renewed the trade embargo twice during the electoral campaign, first in May 1989 and then on October 25th at the height of the Nicaraguan election campaign. In November, Chamorro was brought to the White House for a photo session after which Bush declared that if Chamorro was elected, the U.S. would lift the trade embargo.
*   Utilizing the contras as an instrument for armed propaganda and intimidation in favor of UNO. Congress and the administration signed the "Bipartisan Accord," which – in Baker's words – was intended to "keep the contras alive, intact, and in existence" during the electoral process. Between August 1989 and February 25, 1990 the contras kidnapped approximately 700 civilians, including 50 FSLN campaign activists. There were also threats of reprisals against those who did not vote for UNO. [^4] With this armed propaganda, the message was: the FSLN is incapable of ending the war. In conjunction, a central plank in UNO's campaign promises was abolition of the draft.

At the heart of this psychological warfare was a simple dichotomous message: a vote for the Sandinistas meant a continuation of hostility from the U.S. and thus, continued poverty, hardship, war, and isolation; a vote for UNO, would bring a respite and would mean an immediate end to U.S. aggression, a definitive cessation of military hostilities and millions of dollars in U.S. economic aid. Nicaraguans voted on February 25 with this gun placed at their head. As one observer put it, the UNO victory was an "electoral coup."

### UNO's Covert Support Structure in the U.S.

Having defined the electoral coup strategy, the Bush administration then committed a tremendous amount of public and "private" U.S. money. These resources were channeled through an international network spanning three continents.

The public role played by NED in the Nicaraguan elections is now well documented. Less is known about NED's links to a vast network of private and quasi-private groups ranging from Freedom House to the Center for Democracy and little has been written about the roles of the State Department, the White House, and the Central Intelligence Agency in the Nicaraguan election. [^5]

NED, in conjunction with the State Department, set up a special "task force" for the Nicaraguan elections. This task force included the entire State Department team established in 1988 to handle "humanitarian" assistance to the contras. [^6] The task force also included other top State Department officials, NED personnel, auditors from the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the private firm of Price, Waterhouse, and UNO representatives. Part of this network was run out of an office in Managua staffed by National Democratic Institute (NDI) and National Republican Institute (NRI) representatives. [^7]

For its part the CIA funnelled at least $5 million in covert funding to UNO for "housekeeping" and "political infrastructure" from April to September 1989. [^8] Then in October 1989, the CIA allocated another $6 million for so-called "regional programming," for covert operations staged outside of Nicaragua's borders for the purpose of influencing Nicaragua's elections. Congress had worked out a deal with the administration that it would support the $9 million appropriation for NED electoral operations in exchange for a commitment from the White House that no CIA covert operations aimed at influencing the elections would be conducted within Nicaraguan borders. Thus the second CIA program, from October 1989 to February 1990, involved operations outside of Nicaraguan territory. These operations included support for the contras, political training for UNO personnel in Costa Rica, transmitting radio messages on Radio Impacto from Costa Rica into Nicaragua, financing "electoral observer" trips to Nicaragua for unnamed European journalists, and planting black propaganda in European media for the purpose of "blowbacks" in the U.S. and Nicaragua. [^9]

Other sources reported that CIA political funds formerly used to run the closed Miami contra office had been redirected to UNO. [^10] On November 11, 1989, the Managua daily *El Nuevo Diario* published an exposé about covert commercial enterprises in Costa Rica that had been sending U.S. money to the political opposition since 1981 and were now being used for the UNO electoral campaign.

On October 2, 1989, NED Deputy Director of Programs Barbara Haig (daughter of Alexander Haig) met with Carmen Group officials (see sidebar) to discuss coordination of the Nicaragua project. "We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead," stated David Carmen in a letter to Haig, "I am positive that together we'll bring about real change for democracy in Nicaragua." [^11]

NED's charter prohibited it from giving direct campaign aid to UNO and from carrying out projects within the U.S. Thus, while NED took charge of public and "overt" funding to UNO and its auxiliary organizations in Nicaragua, the Carmen Group was called upon to carry out two clandestine functions: public relations and fund raising for UNO in the United States. The money and supplies raised for UNO by Carmen, in distinction to the NED funds, were sent secretly to Nicaragua and never reported to the Supreme Electoral Council, as Nicaraguan law required.

In a letter to Barbara Haig, a Carmen Group official, Carol Hallett thanked Haig for resolving Carmen Group's "shipping dilemma;" i.e., the problem of how to clandestinely send supplies to UNO so as to avoid Nicaraguan taxes and keep this funding secret. Hallett wrote, "[t]hrough your insight, it seems we have solved our problem. I am currently working with Senator Bob Graham [Dem. Fl.]. His office has assured me they will see that the cargo arrives in Nicaragua." [^12] The letter corroborates charges by Nicaraguan authorities that members of Graham's staff shuttled supplies to Managua, as one of many illicit channels set up by UNO's U.S. supporters.

> ### The Carmen Group
>
> When UNO presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro visited the U.S. in September 1989, one of the agenda items on her itinerary was finalizing the details of a project involving the Washington-based public relations firm, "The Carmen Group."
>
> The Carmen Group was founded in 1982 under the name "Carmen, Carmen and Hugel," by David Carmen, his son Gerald Carmen, and Max Hugel. Hugel, one of Reagan's top campaign managers, was involved in the scandal over sensitive Carter campaign documents being in the possession of Reagan officials.
>
> After Reagan's victory Hugel was appointed Director of Operations of the CIA but was later forced to resign after the *Washington Post* revealed that he had been engaged in illegal stockmarket dealings. Hugel was also a staunch supporter of the contras. Shortly after William Casey's death, Hugel worked with Casey's wife, Sofia, in organizing a fund raising dinner in which 50 percent of the monies went to cancer research, and the other 50 percent, to the "Freedom Fighters Fund" set up by Casey's widow to continue "private" support to counterrevolutionary groups around the world.
>
> The Carmen Group's President, David Carmen, was a senior staff adviser to the Reagan presidential campaigns and one of the founders of Citizens for America. Formed at the White House in 1983, Citizens for America functioned as a quasi-governmental organization which played a key role in mobilizing congressional and public support for military aid to the Nicaraguan contras, and in promoting Reagan's foreign policy agenda in general. Its activities included lobbying swing-voters in hometown congressional districts, organizing speaking tours of the U.S. for contra leaders, and private fund raising for the contras. Citizens for America is no longer very active and much of its political staff has apparently moved to the Carmen Group.
>
> The other Carmen Group principal is Gerald Carmen, who was National Chairman of Citizens for America. One of the Reagan administration's top 100 officials, Carmen served under Reagan as U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Asset Disposition Association. He was also Senior Adviser to the Bush transition team in 1988.
>
> Carmen Group official Carol Boyd Hallett is a close friend of the Reagans and former leader of Citizens for America. In 1986, Hallett was named Ambassador to the Bahamas, a post traditionally related to U.S. intelligence activities in the Caribbean Basin and to clandestine financial transactions, including the kind of money laundering through the Bahamas that was revealed during the Iran/contra investigations. In November 1989, she was appointed Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service.

### The Miami Committee

Although the Carmen Group organized UNO public relations and fund raising, this activity was presented as the work of a group of "leaders from the Nicaraguan exile community" called the "Committee for Free Elections and Democracy in Nicaragua." An internal working document circulated by the Carmen Group in September 1989 explains that "a sizable coordinating office, the Committee for Free Elections and Democracy in Nicaragua, will have to be developed and funded in Miami and funded for 5 months [sic].... This office will have a full time staff of 4, plus a director and outside professional services. Expected costs [will be] $275,000." [^13]

This "Miami Committee" was actually first conceived by the State Department in August 1988 with the objective of serving as one of several liaisons between Washington and the internal opposition in Managua. [^14] Its structures were set up in Miami in the first half of 1989. The Committee would be presented publicly as the legal representative for UNO in the United States (the Committee registered as such with the Department of Justice), with the purpose of carrying out public relations and fund raising.

This strategy allowed the U.S. role, including that of NED and the Carmen Group, to remain undisclosed, and these activities could be presented as a "Nicaraguan initiative" rather than part of the U.S. program. Such was the farce that during her September 1989 visit to Miami, Chamorro announced the official formation of the Committee as an initiative she had undertaken. [^15]

The Board of Directors of the Committee included its Chairman José Antonio Alvarado, a one-time Somoza diplomat at the United Nations and investment banker who had allegedly been involved in contra money laundering; Nadia Pallais, the wife of Luis Pallais Debayle, Somoza's cousin and closest adviser; Carlos Garcia, former Nicaraguan National Guard officer and Somocista businessman; and Nicolas Lopez, the former director of Somoza's newspaper, *La Estrella*.

A working document circulated by the Carmen Group provided strategic guidelines for the UNO electoral campaign, detailing a comprehensive strategy of political activities, psychological operations, and financial expenditures: [^16]

> In order to counter what will most certainly be intense and well financed activity on the part of the Sandinistas, the opposition's campaign must and will take advantage of every hour between now and February 25th, election day....
>
> The population must first be provided with incentives for wanting to attend the rallies. They are therefore fed at these events and given souvenirs of the rally which, in addition to giving them something to take home, also provide a feeling of well being in contrast to the stark poverty in which they have been living under the existing regime. This has the added advantage of keeping the opposition ever present in their minds. Further, these people must be transported to and from the rallies.... Population mobilization and motivation requires resources for a full time organized activity by many campaign workers in the 16 geographic departments into which Nicaragua is divided.

The document also details two important phases of the campaign. Phase I was to raise the following themes among the population: "Hunger, Misery, Obligatory Draft, i.e., the status quo versus Change, Liberty and Employment.... Phase II will consist of telling the population why they should vote for the particular candidates fielded by the UNO. This will emphasize the following themes: The Candidate's values and personalities, Full employment for the country, Freedom of expression, Prosperity and improvement of quality of life."

A careful study of UNO's electoral campaign from September 1989 to February 25, 1990 reveals that this strategy was fully implemented. The themes outlined by the Carmen Group were precisely those themes upon which the UNO campaign was based. Moreover, the language of the Carmen Group document was very similar to that found in both CIA and Psychological Operations (psyops) and Pentagon Civic Action manuals. [^17]

The strategy document budgets $709,500 in "souvenirs" for Phase I, including UNO caps, T-shirts, plastic glasses, flags, and bumper stickers. Phase II called for an additional $1 million for more "souvenirs" and $1.7 million in "salaries and equipment."

The travel budget for UNO officials was $168,000 and was used for trips to Miami and a variety of other U.S. cities. This budget also included $320,000 for trips to Nicaragua by North American, Latin American, and European "observers." The total UNO budget drawn up in the Carmen document was $4.3 million.

In January 1990, the Nicaraguan daily, *El Nuevo Diario* published an UNO payroll spread-sheet of one month's salaries. This document included the names of hundreds of local and national UNO activists with monthly salaries ranging from $500 for UNO's "National Electoral Control Chief," $250 for regional and zonal campaign heads, $150 for district campaign chiefs, $60 for municipal heads, and between $50-$60 for UNO workers. Considering that this money was paid every month beginning as early as September or October 1989, UNO paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in salaries.

Exactly how much of these funds was actually spent, or what percentage was handled by Carmen and what percentage passed through other channels, is not clear. The important point is that this spending was distinct from the $12.5 million that Congress appropriated for NED to spend overtly on indirect campaign activities.

Carmen Group President David Carmen admitted that his group raised at least $600,000 for UNO campaign materials. [^18] Additional Carmen Group documents indicate that approximately $1 million was funneled through the organization. According to Miami Committee Director José Alvarado, former contra Ernesto Palazio, who was later named UNO representative in Washington, D.C., raised at least $50,000 for UNO. In addition, phone solicitations and "fund raising events" in Miami raised tens of thousands more. [^19]

### Secret Shipments

The Miami Committee-Carmen Group operation also involved NED. The National Republican Institute for International Affairs (NRI), one of the four NED "core groups," was apparently appointed as liaison to the Miami Committee. NRI Director Keith Schuette personally oversaw the production in Miami of UNO campaign propaganda, even though the NED charter expressly prohibited such activity.

Schuette contracted the Miami printing company, Creative Marketing Ideas, to print UNO T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other electoral paraphernalia. Creative Marketing Ideas is run by Luis Argüello, a Somocista businessmen who left Nicaragua before the Revolution. "Thank you for your quick response on the printing of the T-shirts of our Nicaragua program," states an October 6, 1989 letter from Schuette to Argüello. The letter specifies that the order was for $17,632 worth of T-shirts, printed with UNO campaign slogans.

Schuette's letter also stated, "Please advise if this price includes tax, as we are a tax-exempt organization." Thus, NED not only secretly violated its charter in these operations, but also the regulations guiding its tax-exempt status.

Senator Bob Graham's office was only one of numerous clandestine channels for UNO shipments to Nicaragua. Other freight was shipped from Miami freight companies to Costa Rica, and from there sent secretly over land into Nicaragua. Receipts and internal letters documenting these transactions indicate that the "Faith Freight Forwarding Corp." of Miami sent a 20-foot crate to Puerto Limon, Costa Rica, on December 19. The crate was shipped under the name of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Jr., who is Violeta Chamorro's son and a former member of the contra directorate.

According to the receipts, the crate contained, among other items, a large box sent by Creative Marketing Ideas and 2.5 tons worth of UNO campaign posters. It also included materials produced by American Photo Inc. in Miami such as plastic glasses, plastic bags, and plastic UNO flags – precisely the campaign materials detailed in the Carmen Group strategy document. A document sent to UNO headquarters in Managua on December 20, 1989, by Roberto Faith from the Faith Freight Forwarding Corp., and addressed to Chamorro Jr., states:

> I'm sending you a copy of 'loading Guide No. 003944' which describes the contents of the load that left on December 19 and should arrive at Puerto Limon on December 24. From there it will be taken to San Jose and sent overland to Managua. I have also sent a FAX copy of this project to Mr. Richard Beck of Atlas Electricas in Costa Rica, who will help in shipment from San Jose to Managua. My office in San Jose, which has a lot of experience, will also cooperate in this endeavor. [^20]

### A "Pleasant Evening with Jeane" Kirkpatrick

One of the Carmen Group's projects involved organizing a U.S. tour for Violeta Chamorro. For this project alone, the Carmen Group received a donation of $145,000 from Republican millionaire Fred Sacher. In 1985, Sacher made a $305,000 donation to the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL), one of Oliver North's front groups, set up by Iran/contra accomplice Carl "Spitz" Channell. [^21]

Sacher's donation to NEPL was deposited in one of the secret Swiss bank accounts used to purchase black market arms for the contras. [^22] Following Sacher's donation to the Carmen Group, the Chamorro tour was baptized the "Sacher Project" by David Carmen.

> ### The Carmen Group received a donation of $145,000 from Republican millionaire Fred Sacher.

The one-week tour was scheduled for January 1990 and involved daytime meetings with all the major print and television media on the East Coast, followed by nightly $1000-a-plate fund raising dinners in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., and Miami. [^23] The tour was cancelled at the last minute, after Chamorro broke her knee. Nevertheless, the post-tour budget shows that despite the cancellation, $95,000 of Sacher's donation was used, including $15,000 paid to David Carmen's son, Gerald, for acting as "tour manager."

Although Violeta Chamorro could not be present, the Carmen Group organized a fund raising dinner in New York City on February 7, 1990. Twenty wealthy Republican couples donated $5,000 per couple to attend. The dinner, held at the home of Seymour and Evie Holtzman, featured Jeane Kirkpatrick as the guest of honor. The invitations sent by David Carmen read, "these elections can be the turning point in restoring that part of Central America to Democracy and...[can] set in motion the cure for Cuba and finally end the threat that we face down there... please join us for an interesting evening with Jeane."

Among the invitees were former Reagan Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan, Sofia Casey, the widow of former CIA Director William Casey, and Holly Coors of the Coors Family, which had earlier donated millions of dollars to the contras and Faith Whittlesey, former Co-Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison (OPL). [^24]

Nine days after the dinner, Kirkpatrick appeared as the keynote speaker at a conference titled "Elections in Nicaragua: Democracy or Deception" and convened by the ultra-right American Defense Institute. In her speech she described the elections as a "farce orchestrated by the communists."

During the conference, an eight-minute UNO public relations video was shown which painted Chamorro as the "Cory Aquino of Nicaragua" fighting "communism and totalitarianism." The Carmen Group paid J.R. Black $12,000 to produce the video. Black, who runs a shadowy operation called "International Media Associates," was introduced to NED President Carl Gershman by William Geimer, the President of the Jamestown Foundation which has been linked to U.S. covert activities. [^25] In an introductory letter to Gershman, Geimer explains that "Black proposes to produce a videotape [to] speak about the evils of communism, and to disseminate the tapes in Nicaragua prior to the February election...we will of course provide him with access to Jamestown clients." [^26]

### The Jefferson Foundation

The Jefferson Educational Foundation is another organization which played an integral role in promoting UNO in the U.S. and abroad. The Jefferson Foundation, an ultra-right organization connected to the fascist fringe of U.S. politics, played an important role in the Reagan administration's policy towards Central America. Among the Jefferson Foundation's board members are John Singlaub, Barry Goldwater, John Lehman, and Senators Alfonse D'Amato, Orrin Hatch, Connie Mack, and Strom Thurmond.

During the 1980s the Jefferson Educational Foundation ran a "Central America Awareness Program," which worked with the White House Office of Public Liaison and the White House Working Group on Central America, promoting anti-Sandinista propaganda and the use of "public diplomacy."

In December 1989, the Jefferson Foundation organized a series of public and private meetings in Paris on the Nicaraguan elections. According to its literature, the goal of the meetings was to "gain crucial European commitments" and "build international support for President Bush's emphasis on truly free elections...."

The Paris meetings were run by Robert R. Reilly, a member of the Jefferson Foundation, who worked with the Heritage Foundation in the late 1970s before Ronald Reagan appointed him Director of the Office for Private Sector Programs (OPSF) of the U.S. Information Agency. Despite its innocuous name, the OPSF was responsible for channeling U.S. government money into "private" organizations participating in Reagan's foreign policy, and in particular, in building a trans-Atlantic network of rightwing groups in Europe and the U.S. to coordinate the conservative agenda.

Reilly was later appointed to the White House Office of Public Liaison and given the responsibility of coordinating a propaganda campaign around alleged "Sandinista persecution of the Church in Nicaragua."

Among those invited to participate in the Paris program was UNO militant Lino Hernandez, executive director of the "Nicaraguan Human Rights Commission," an NED-funded entity. The anti-Sandinista Bishop, Pablo Antonio Vega and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Jr. were also invited. The Jefferson Foundation also brought Jaime Daremblum, a rightwing Costa Rican columnist and professor who is noted for his anti-Sandinista editorials. Daremblum is a major Costa Rican recipient of NED funds, and sits on the boards or advisory councils of several anti-Sandinista propaganda programs funded out of Costa Rica by NED. In another example of the coordination among different U.S. groups, it is interesting to note that the Carmen Group made the travel arrangements for Lino Hernandez and Pablo Antonio Vega.

### Conclusion

The U.S. government's electoral intervention strategy is as equally dangerous and misguided as was its military support of the contra war. Unfortunately, it has proven more palatable to Congress because of its emphasis on political and psychological operations. Even more disturbing, the U.S. strategy has gone virtually unreported in the mainsteam media. NED has proven to be a very effective tool for intervention – perhaps even more effective than the CIA.

Eventhough the Cold War evaporates and pressures build for a "peace dividend," Washington continues its interventionist policy abroad. Given the rise of perestroika in Europe, many Nicaraguans have wondered if it is not time for "Yankeestroika" in the Americas. Is it not time for the United States to democratize its relations with other countries?

## On the Side of Pol Pot: U.S. Supports Khmer Rouge

**by Jack Colhoun***

For the last eleven years the United States government, in a covert operation born of cynicism and hypocrisy, has collaborated with the genocidal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. More specifically, Washington has covertly aided and abetted the Pol Potists' guerrilla war to overthrow the Vietnamese-backed government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, which replaced the Khmer Rouge regime.

The U.S. government's secret partnership with the Khmer Rouge grew out of the U.S. defeat in the Vietnam War. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the U.S. – worried by the shift in the Southeast Asian balance of power – turned once again to geopolitical confrontation. It quickly formalized an anti-Vietnamese, anti-Soviet strategic alliance with China – an alliance whose disastrous effects have been most evident in Cambodia. For the U.S., playing the "China card" has meant sustaining the Khmer Rouge as a geopolitical counterweight capable of destabilizing the Hun Sen government in Cambodia and its Vietnamese allies.

When Vietnam intervened in Cambodia and drove the Pol Potists from power in January 1979, Washington took immediate steps to preserve the Khmer Rouge as a guerrilla movement. International relief agencies were pressured by the U.S. to provide humanitarian assistance to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who fled into Thailand. For more than a decade, the Khmer Rouge have used the refugee camps they occupy as military bases to wage a contra war in Cambodia.

According to Linda Mason and Roger Brown, who studied the relief operations in Thailand for Cambodian refugees: [^1]

> ...relief organizations supplied the Khmer Rouge resistance movement with food and medicines.... In the Fall of 1979 the Khmer Rouge were the most desperate of all the refugees who came to the Thai-Kampuchean border. Throughout 1980, however, their health rapidly improved, and relief organizations began questioning the legitimacy of feeding them. The Khmer Rouge...having regained strength... had begun actively fighting the Vietnamese. The relief organizations considered supporting the Khmer Rouge inconsistent with their humanitarian goals.... Yet Thailand, the country that hosted the relief operation, and the U.S. government, which funded the bulk of the relief operations, insisted that the Khmer Rouge be fed.

During his reign as National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski played an important role in determining how the U.S. would support the Pol Pot guerrillas. Elizabeth Becker, an expert on Cambodia, recently wrote, "Brzezinski himself claims that he concocted the idea of persuading Thailand to cooperate fully with China in efforts to rebuild the Khmer Rouge.... Brzezinski said, 'I encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot. I encouraged the Thai to help the DK [Democratic Kampuchea]. The question was how to help the Cambodian people. Pol Pot was an abomination. We could never support him but China could.' " [^2]

### An Unholy Alliance

The U.S. not only permitted the Khmer Rouge to use the refugee camps in Thailand as a base for its war against the new government in Phnom Penh but it also helped Prince Norodom Sihanouk and former Prime Minister Son Sann to organize their own guerrilla armies from the refugee population in the camps. These camps are an integral factor in the ability of the Khmer Rouge, the Sihanoukist National Army (ANS) and Son Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) to wage war against the Hun Sen government.

In 1979, Washington began "a small program" of support for Sihanouk's and Son Sann's guerrillas by providing "travel expenses" for the "insurgent leaders" and funds "for the upkeep of resistance camps near the Thai-Cambodian border." [^3] In addition, since 1982, the U.S. has provided the ANS and KPNLF with covert and overt "humanitarian" and "nonlethal" military aid. By 1989, the secret nonlethal aid had grown to between $20 million and $24 million annually and the overt humanitarian aid had reached $5 million. The Bush administration requested $7 million more in humanitarian aid for 1990. [^4]

When Congress approved the $5 million aid package for the ANS and KPNLF in 1985, it prohibited use of the aid "...for the purpose or with the effect of promoting, sustaining or augmenting, directly or indirectly, the capacity of the Khmer Rouge...to conduct military or paramilitary operations in Cambodia or elsewhere...."

From the beginning, U.S. aid for the ANS and KPNLF has been a complimentary source of aid for the Khmer Rouge. According to a western diplomat stationed in Southeast Asia, "...two-thirds of the arms aid to the noncommunist forces appears to come from Peking [Beijing], along with more extensive aid to the communist fighters (the Khmer Rouge].... China is estimated to spend $60 million to $100 million yearly in aid to all factions of the anti-Vietnamese resistance. [^5]

In 1982, under pressure from the U.S., China, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Sihanouk and Son Sann joined forces with the Khmer Rouge to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). The ANS and KPNLF, which were more politically respectable than the Khmer Rouge, gained military credibility from the guerrilla alliance. However, the Khmer Rouge gained considerable political legitimacy from the alliance and Khmer Rouge diplomats now represent the CGDK at the United Nations.

The CGDK receives large amounts of military aid from Singapore. When asked about the relationship between money from the U.S. and arms from Singapore, another U.S. diplomat in Southeast Asia replied, "Let's put it this way. If the U.S. supplies [the guerrilla coalition] with food, then they can spend their food money on something else." [^6]

### Direct U.S. Aid

But there are indications of direct U.S. links to the Khmer Rouge. Former Deputy Director of the CIA, Ray Cline, visited a Khmer Rouge camp inside Cambodia in November 1980. When asked about the visit, the Thai Foreign Ministry denied that Cline had illegally crossed into Cambodian territory. However, privately, the Thai government admitted that the trip had occurred. Cline's trip to the Pol Pot camp was originally revealed in a press statement released by Khmer Rouge diplomats at the United Nations. [^7]

Cline also went to Thailand as a representative of the Reagan-Bush transition team and briefed the Thai government on the new administration's policy toward Southeast Asia. Cline told the Thais the Reagan administration planned to "strengthen its cooperation" with Thailand and the other ASEAN members opposed to the Phnom Penh government.

There have been numerous other reports about direct links between the CIA and the Khmer Rouge. According to Jack Anderson, "[t]hrough China, the CIA is even supporting the jungle forces of the murderous Pol Pot in Cambodia." [^8] Sihanouk himself admitted that CIA advisers were present in Khmer Rouge camps in late 1989: "Just one month ago, I received intelligence informing me that there were U.S. advisers in the Khmer Rouge camps in Thailand, notably in Site B camp.... The CIA men are teaching the Khmer Rouge human rights! The CIA wants to turn tigers into kittens!" [^9]

By late 1989 the distinction between "direct or indirect" U.S. support for the Khmer Rouge was less clear. When CGDK forces launched an offensive in September 1989, Sihanouk's and Son Sann's armies openly cooperated with the Khmer Rouge. Moreover, by then the Khmer Rouge had infiltrated the military and political wings of the ANS and KPNLF.

Sihanouk confirmed ANS and KPNLF military collaboration with the Khmer Rouge in a radio message broadcast clandestinely in Cambodia. "I would particularly like to commend the fact that our three armies know how to cordially cooperate with one another... We assist each other in every circumstance and cooperate with one another on the battlefield of the Cambodian motherland...." [^10] Sihanouk specifically mentioned military cooperation in battles at Battambang, Siem Reap, and Oddar Meanchey.

Evidence of increased involvement of U.S. military advisers in Cambodia has also begun to surface. A report in the *London Sunday Correspondent* noted that "American advisers are reported to have been helping train guerrillas of the non-communist Khmer resistance and may have recently gone into Cambodia with them.... Reports of increased U.S. involvement have also emerged from the northern town of Sisophon, where local officials say four westerners accompanied guerrillas in an attack on the town last month." [^11]

> ### "Any private citizen who wants to give more than just moral support to help the KPNLF rebels can send money."

Although the U.S. government denies supplying the ANS and KPNLF with military hardware, a recent report claimed that KPNLF forces had received a shipment of weapons from the U.S. including M-16s, grenade launchers, and recoilless rifles. [^12] It has also been reported that the U.S. is providing the KPNLF with high resolution satellite photographs and "[s]everal KPNLF commanders... claim Americans were sent to train some 40 elite guerrillas in the use of sophisticated U.S.-made Dragon anti-tank missiles in a four-month course that ended last month." When the KPNLF launched a major offensive on September 30, a large number of U.S. officials were sighted in the border region, near the fighting. [^13]

Washington's link to the anti-Phnom Penh guerrilla factions was formalized in 1989 when KPNLF diplomat Sichan Siv was appointed as a deputy assistant to President George Bush. Siv's official assignment in the White House is the Public Liaison Office, where he works with different constituency groups, such as Khmer residents in the U.S. and other minority, foreign policy, youth, and education groups. Siv escaped from Cambodia in 1976 and immigrated to the U.S., where he joined the KPNLF. From 1983 to 1987, Siv served as a KPNLF representative at the United Nations as part of the CGDK delegation which was headed by Khmer Rouge diplomats. [^14]

> ### In 1989, KPNLF diplomat Sichan Siv was appointed as a deputy assistant to President George Bush.

As part of the Bush administration, Sichan Siv is significantly involved in the formulation and conduct of U.S. policy in Cambodia. He was a "senior adviser" to the U.S. delegation attending an international conference on Cambodia held last summer in Paris, where the U.S. demanded the dismantling of the Hun Sen government and the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in an interim four-party government. He was also the moderator of a White House briefing on Cambodia in October 1989 for Khmer residents in the U.S.

Another one of Siv's assignments has been to work as a liaison with far Right groups which provide political and material support for the KPNLF. He attended a World Anti-Communist League (WACL) conference in Dallas, Texas in September 1985 along with other anti-communist "freedom fighters" from around the world. [^15] At the WACL conference, the KPNLF openly sought "outside training and support in intelligence and demolition." [^16]

Siv has also worked with retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Theodore Mataxis, who heads up the North Carolina-based Committee for a Free Cambodia (CFC). Mataxis was approached by senior KPNLF generals in 1986 to set up the CFC to organize support in the U.S. for the KPNLF.

### Right Wing Support

According to the Reagan doctrine, the goal of U.S. foreign policy was to "contain Soviet expansion" by supporting counterrevolutionary groups in Angola, Nicaragua, Cambodia, etc. and, in essence, "roll back" the "Soviet empire." Many of the rightwing groups which gained prominence after Reagan's election immediately started programs to support contras across the globe. The World Anti-Communist League, the Heritage Foundation, the Freedom Research Foundation, as well as many others, all pressed hard for support of the "freedom fighters." [^17]

In its 1984 policy report entitled, *Mandate for Leadership II: Continuing the Conservative Revolution*, the Heritage Foundation called on the Reagan administration to focus even more closely on these counterrevolutionary struggles and to:

> ...employ paramilitary assets to weaken those communist and noncommunist regimes that may already be facing the early stages of insurgency within their borders and which threaten U.S. interests.... Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam reflect such conditions, as do Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Iran and Libya.

In 1984, rightwing activist/adventurer Jack Wheeler stated that "[t]here are eight anti-Soviet guerrilla wars being conducted in the third world at this moment.... Sooner or later, one of these movements is going to win.... The first successful overthrow of a Soviet puppet regime may, in fact, precipitate a 'reverse domino effect,' a toppling of Soviet dominos, one after the other." [^18]

Not surprisingly, Wheeler is a big supporter of the Cambodian contra movement and has openly solicited material and political support for the KPNLF. In August 1984 he wrote an article for the Moonie-owned *Washington Times* in which he said, "After spending a week with the KPNLF inside Cambodia...one is drawn inescapably to the conclusion that the KPNLF does indeed represent a real third noncommunist alternative for Cambodia.... [But] the KPNLF is...running seriously low on weapons and ammunition. The lack of ammunition for rifles, rocket launchers, machine guns and mortars, is especially critical." [^19]

Just how "private" the support Wheeler solicits for the KPNLF is open to question. Listed, along with Wheeler, on the Board of Directors of Freedom Research Foundation are Alex Alexiev and Mike Kelly. Alexiev is "with the National Security Division of the Rand Corporation... [and is] an expert on Soviet activities in the third world." Kelly was Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower Resources and Military Personnel in the early 1980s. Kelly had earlier been a legislative assistant to the rightwing Senators Bill Armstrong (Rep.-Colo.) and John Tower(Rep.-Tex.). [^20]

### Ted Mataxis Rides Again

Retired Brigadier-General Ted Mataxis personifies the historic ties of the U.S. to the KPNLF. In 1971-72, Mataxis worked with General Sak Sutsakhan when he was chief of the U.S. Military Equipment Delivery Team (MEDT) in Phnom Penh. Mataxis's official role was to supervise the delivery of U.S military aid to then-Cambodian Premier Lon Nol. However, Mataxis's assignment also included a covert role – overseeing the escalation of U.S. forces in Cambodia after the April 1970 U.S. invasion. Mataxis was well suited for working on covert operations in Cambodia, having trained at the Army's Strategic Intelligence School in the late 1940s. [^21]

Despite a 1970 congressional ban on aid to the Lon Nol army, there continued to be reports of MEDT personnel working as advisers to the Cambodian military. There were also reports of U.S. helicopters providing transport for Cambodian troops as well as supplying them with ammunition during battles. The U.S. also opened a radio station at Pochentong Airport, near Phnom Penh, to "help coordinate air support for Cambodian troops." [^22]

When Mataxis retired from the U.S. Army in 1972, he began working as a "military consultant" to the Defense Ministry of Singapore. "When I was down in Singapore I worked with them [Sak and the other Lon Nol generals] very closely. We used to do repairs on their ships and other things," Mataxis explained. "When Congress cut off money to them in 1973, they came down to see what Singapore could do to help them out. I got a team together from Singapore, and we went up to Phnom Penh. We made arrangements to buy old brass, old weapons and other stuff [to sell for profit] so they'd have money for supplies and other things." [^23] Under U.S. law old U.S. weapons and scrap metal military equipment provided to allies is U.S. property, but there was no known official objection to Mataxis's end run around the congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the Lon Nol generals.

Mataxis recalled when Major General Pak Son Anh (who at the time worked closely with General Sak, the military commander of the KPNLF) visited him in Washington in 1986. "They [Pak and other KPNLF officers] came to see me and asked what I could do. They came up to my office at the Committee for a Free Afghanistan.... They asked us to set up something like that [for the KPNLF]. So I went over to see Admiral [Thomas] Moorer. I took General Pak along and asked Admiral Moorer if he could act as a Godfather for us. He said, 'Yes, you can use my name.' " [^24] Moorer was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Mataxis was head of the MEDT, and Mataxis's work in Cambodia was supervised by Moorer and Admiral John McCain, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Forces, 1968-72.

Mataxis spent much of 1987 setting up the Committee for a Free Cambodia (CFC). He visited General Sak in Thailand to determine the KPNLF's needs and promoted the KPNLF in the U.S. "I set it up for Pak to go to one of those American Security Council meetings [in Washington] in 1986. Then we had another one in 1987, where guerrillas from around the world came.... They'd get together and each guerrilla group would have a chance to get up and give his bit. It gave them a chance to exchange ideas and say what they were doing," Mataxis stated. [^25] Rightwing support has been an important factor in keeping the Cambodian contras supplied. Even though Ted Mataxis lost in Vietnam, his war is not over.

### Conclusion

Although most people believe that the U.S. ended its intervention in Southeast Asia in 1975, it is evident from the information provided here that the U.S. continues to support repressive and non-democratic forces in the jungles of Cambodia. When asked about U.S. policy in Cambodia during an April 26, 1990 ABC News special, Rep. Chester Atkins (Dem.-Mass.) characterized it as "a policy of hatred."

The U.S. is directly responsible for millions of deaths in Southeast Asia over the past 30 years. Now, the U.S. government provides support to a movement condemned by the international community as genocidal. [^26] How long must this policy of hatred continue?

## Was the CIA Involved? The Bombing of Pan Am 103

**by Jeff Jones***

Pan Am 103, the jumbo jet that blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988, might have passed into history as simply another example of the tragic loss of life spilling out of the Middle East conflict. But, as with other incidents of this kind, the official investigation leaves questions unanswered. Many relatives of the victims – the plane's 259 passengers, and 11 people on the ground – fear that the full truth will never be known.

By most accounts, investigators believe the crash was caused by a sophisticated bomb – with a time-delay, barometric fuse – placed on the plane by Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), a Syrian-backed group that rejects PLO efforts to negotiate with Israel.

Flight 103 originated at Frankfurt and continued on, with another plane, from London. The bomb detonated at 7:03 p.m. If it had gone off just 10 minutes later, the Pan Am clipper would have already crossed the Scottish coast and the plane – its victims and evidence – would have vanished in the North Atlantic. Jibril has denied responsibility for the attack. But investigators believe that the PFLP-GC received a large payment from Iran – ABC News has reported $10 million – to carry out the attack to avenge the U.S. downing of an Iranian airbus in which nearly 300 people died on July 3, 1988.

Paul Hudson, an Albany, New York lawyer, is the president of Families of Pan Am 103/Lockerbie, one of three groups made up of relatives of the victims. Paul and Eleanor Hudson's 16-year-old daughter Melina was returning home from a year of school in England when she died in the crash. "Anything that will prevent a coverup,...that will keep others from experiencing what we have, is important," Eleanor Hudson said recently. "The full truth should come out," Paul Hudson agreed. The charge of cover up does not come easily to either Eleanor or Paul. But Paul Hudson, who has followed the investigation closely, is dismayed at its progress. "It appears that the government either has the facts and is covering this up," he said, "or doesn't know all the facts and doesn't want to."

### Many Questions

Most of the initial controversy surrounding Pan Am 103 focused on the U.S. government's long standing policy of not informing the general public when an airline, an air-travel corridor or a specific flight has been threatened by terrorist attack. Pan Am 103 fit in to all of these categories. But there are many other questions percolating just beneath the surface of the investigation:

*   There were, it is now known, at least four, and, according to one unsubstantiated report, as many as eight, CIA and other U.S. intelligence agency operatives returning from Beirut, Lebanon, aboard the plane. The Lockerbie bomb crippled U.S. intelligence efforts in the Middle East. Were the intelligence operatives on 103 the bomb's target?
*   A CIA team headed for Lockerbie within an hour of the crash. [^1] At least once during the ground search, CIA investigators wore Pan Am uniforms; and according to one unrefuted allegation, CIA operatives temporarily removed a suitcase from the site that belonged to one of their agents, thereby breaking the Scottish police investigators, "chain of evidence," which could be crucial to any successful prosecutions.
*   Also aboard Pan Am 103 was Bernt Carlsson, the Swedish U.N. diplomat, who had just completed negotiating the Namibian independence agreement with South Africa. He was due in New York the next day to sign the agreement.
*   In October 1988, the West German Federal Police, the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), raided a suspected terrorist safehouse. During the raid, they found a bomb – hidden in a Toshiba radio – that was virtually identical to the one believed later to have brought down Pan Am 103. All but one of the 16 people arrested were soon released and several of them are now top suspects in the bombing.
*   Pan Am was fined more than $600,000 by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for lax security at its baggage-handling facility in Frankfurt. And according to the West German newsweekly *Stern*, a Pan Am security official in Frankfurt was spotted after the crash backdating a copy of a crucial FAA memo. The memo described a call placed to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki in which the caller reportedly warned that a bomb would be smuggled onto a Pan Am aircraft flying from Frankfurt to the United States.
*   The most startling and controversial charge to surface around Pan Am 103 comes from a report issued by a little-known New York City-based intelligence group called Interfor, Inc. [^2] The company was hired by the law firm representing Pan Am's insurance agents to find out what happened. The Interfor Report was leaked to the press last fall. Its immediate impact was to stall, indefinitely, the approximately 300 civil court cases filed against Pan Am by relatives of the victims. Interfor has charged that a rogue CIA unit in Frankfurt, seeking to make a deal for the release of U.S. hostages in Beirut, was protecting a Middle East heroin smuggling operation being run through Pan Am's Frankfurt baggage operation. The fatal bomb, according to this allegation, was placed on the plane in a suitcase substituted for one that normally would have contained contraband.

> ### The bomb was placed on the plane at London's Heathrow Airport when a baggage handler switched suitcases belonging to CIA officer Matthew Gannon.

*   But according to a January 1990 report on *Frontline*, the PBS news program, the bomb was placed on the plane at London's Heathrow Airport when a baggage handler switched suitcases belonging to CIA officer Matthew Gannon. *Frontline* believes the planning for the retaliatory bomb attack was already under way when the group learned that several top U.S. intelligence officers would be flying Pan Am 103 out of London's Heathrow Airport. Gannon and two other operatives, having left Beirut by separate routes, may have made a fatal error when they purchased their plane tickets over-the-counter from a travel agent in Nicosia. According to *Frontline*, the only piece of luggage not accounted for from the flight belonged to Gannon. *Frontline*'s investigators believe that the intelligence officers were "a strong secondary target" and that a suitcase identical to Gannon's was switched at Heathrow.
*   And according to syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, President George Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held a transatlantic phone conversation some time last year, in which they agreed that the investigation into the crash should be "limited" in order to avoid harming the two nations' intelligence communities. Thatcher has acknowledged that the conversation took place, but denied she and Bush sought to interfere with the investigation.

### The Interfor Report

The controversial Interfor Report maintains that a Frankfurt-based CIA team was protecting a heroin smuggling operation in hopes of obtaining information about U.S. hostages in Lebanon – the same hostages that sparked the Iran/contra arms-for-hostages scandal.

The report claims that the drug smuggling ring is headed by Syrian Monzer Al-Kassar, and controls at least one Pan Am baggage handler at the Frankfurt airport. The handler was responsible for switching luggage that had already been inspected with identical pieces holding contraband. A passenger accomplice would then pick up the bag upon its arrival in the U.S. Interfor admits it does not know how the bags passed through customs on arrival, but insists in its report, that "this route and method worked steadily and smoothly for a long time."

Al-Kassar is a known arms and drug smuggler who had received money from two Iran/contra figures, Albert Hakim and Richard Secord, to buy 100 tons of small arms for the Nicaraguan contras. According to the report, he was also the go-between for a French effort in May 1988 that gained the release of French hostages in Lebanon in exchange for an arms shipment to Iran. Al-Kassar was spotted by the CIA team in Frankfurt which, knowing he had close ties to Syria's chief of intelligence, "... approached Al-Kassar and offered to allow him to continue his drug smuggling routes... if he helped arrange the release of the American hostages."

The Interfor Report says that the CIA group in Frankfurt, although it had contact with the West German BKA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), operated to some extent as "an internal covert operation, without consistent oversight, á la Oliver North." In the days before the attack on Flight 103, the report states that Al-Kassar learned that a bomb was going to be placed on the plane by Jibril's Popular Front. On the day of the flight, a BKA surveillance agent assigned to watch baggage being loaded "... noticed that the 'drug' suitcase substituted was different" from those used in previous shipments. He phoned in a report to his superiors "saying something was very wrong."

The BKA relayed the information to the CIA unit, which reported to its control in Washington. The report alleges that "Control replied: Don't worry about it, don't stop it, let it go." The CIA in Frankfurt did nothing to prevent the plane from taking off, because the team "did not want to blow its surveillance operation and undercover penetration or to risk the Al-Kassar hostage-release operation." The report postulates that the CIA assumed – incorrectly – that West German authorities, who also watching the flight, would intervene.

The Interfor Report also explains why a special U.S. hostage rescue team was on board Pan Am 103 when it was destroyed. According to the report, the team, led by Army Major Charles McKee, had learned that the CIA unit in Frankfurt was protecting Al-Kassar's drug pipeline. McKee reported to CIA headquarters he feared "...that [his team's] rescue [operation] and their lives would be endangered by the double-dealing." [^3]

When CIA headquarters did not respond, the McKee team decided to return home without permission. The Interfor Report states that "their plan was to bring the evidence back to the United States [of the CIA's involvement with Al-Kassar and drug dealing] ...and publicize their findings if the government covered it up." Agents connected to Al-Kassar through Syrian intelligence saw the McKee team make their travel arrangements back to the U.S., and, according to the report, Al-Kassar informed his Frankfurt CIA protectors of McKee's plans.

Following the leak of the Interfor Report, Pan Am went before the federal judge hearing the civil suits against the airline and asked that he subpoena the CIA, FBI, DEA, and State Department in an effort to verify Interfor's findings. The government moved to quash the subpoenas on national security grounds. The Justice Department then took the case out of the hands of its local attorneys by sending a team from Washington to handle the litigation. A ruling is still pending.

### Who Was Warned?

There is also considerable controversy surrounding a warning the U.S. government received about a possible plane bombing but never made public. A notice, reportedly based on a tip called into the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, was posted in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and elsewhere – including electronic bulletin boards – where it could be seen by government officials.

The State Department now calls the threat a "hoax." But the FAA took it seriously enough at the time to issue one of its rare security alerts, an alert that was in effect on the day Flight 103 went down. The Pan Am jet, travelling the crowded Frankfurt-London-New York City corridor four days before Christmas, was only two-thirds full. Many relatives of the victims are convinced that this was because government employees avoided the flight.

One official who didn't avoid the flight was Bernt Carlsson, the Swedish U.N. diplomat who successfully negotiated the Namibia accord which led to free elections and a SWAPO-led government in the former South African colony. Carlsson was due at the U.N. the day after the crash to sign the agreement. "Pik" Botha, the South African Foreign Minister, had also been scheduled to fly on Pan Am 103 but he switched his reservation, avoided the flight, and was in New York for the signing.

*(Image: Bernt Carlsson (right), U.N. Commissioner for Namibia, was killed in the PanAm 103 bombing. Credit: Associated Press)*

According to Sanya Popovic, Carlsson's then fiancée, Botha acknowledged at the time that he had been advised to switch planes. Popovic believes that the U.N. also received the warnings about the flight, but that Carlsson was never informed.

The President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism issued its report – not on who was responsible for the bomb, but what, if any, changes should be made in airline security – in mid-May 1990 (see sidebar). The FBI and Scotland Yard have been cooperating with Scottish police (in whose jurisdiction the plane crashed). Their final report will be released in June 1990.

The primary reason that the PFLP-GC is suspected of planting the fatal device, has to do with the similarity between the Pan Am bomb – probably consisting of Semtex, a Czechoslovakian-made plastic explosive hidden in a Toshiba radio – and a bomb found by the BKA during an October 1988 raid on a PFLP-GC safe house in Neuss, West Germany.

That raid, carried out as part of an undercover BKA surveillance operation code-named Autumn Leaves, left West German officials facing intense criticism. Of the 16 people they rounded up, all but one were quickly released from jail. And some of those released are now suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. (The West Germans were further embarrassed when, nearly three months after the Pan Am bombing, several more similar bombs turned up during a subsequent BKA search of the Neuss safe house.) There are enough apparent mistakes and lapses in the West German handling of Autumn Leaves to argue that the bungled investigation allowed the bombers to slip through police hands.

That was the impression conveyed in a recent *New York Times Magazine* story on Pan Am 103. [^4] The article, edited from a new book, *The Fall of Pan Am 103*, by Steven Emerson and Brian Duffy, focused entirely on the West German police and neglected to mention many of the questions that have troubled reporters and families of the crash victims. The article did not even mention the presence of the CIA personnel on the plane, or describe any of the subsequent CIA actions at the crash site.

The *Times* version of the story surprised Duffy, an assistant managing editor of *U.S. News & World Report*. The book goes into "great detail" about who the CIA officers were, Duffy said. "If the book has news value, it rests in part on our conclusions on who the intelligence officers were and what they were doing." He too was surprised that the *Times* editing of the story focused solely on the West Germans.

In fact, the Emerson/Duffy book is long on speculation and short on conclusion. The authors do not purport to know just what happened. They believe that Khalid Jaafar, a young Arab-American from Detroit, "unwittingly" carried the bomb hidden in a bag onto the plane in Frankfurt. Who gave it to him, and why he didn't "examine" the contents, they say, "is the biggest mystery of the Lockerbie investigation."

That, however, is hardly Lockerbie's biggest mystery. For one thing, *Frontline* reported shortly after the Emerson/Duffy book went to press that all of Jaafar's bags had been accounted for. Whichever bag or suitcase held the bomb, had to disintegrate into fragments, thereby clearing Jaafar's name. His parents believe he became a suspect because he had the only Arabic surname on the flight list.

But the more serious questions raised in the investigation have to do with the nature of the investigation, and why so many relatives and reporters feel a fog of disinformation hangs heavy over the crash.

### The President's Commission

The President's Commission on Airline Security and Terrorism issued its report on May 15, 1990, leaving many questions about the bombing of Pan Am 103 unanswered. But it did make a series of recommendations, including that the U.S. should be more willing to attack suspected terrorists and the states that harbor or support them."National will and the moral courage to exercise it are the ultimate means for defeating terrorism," the Commission says. The report calls for government officials to become more vigorous in "planning and training for preemptive or retaliatory military strikes against known terrorist enclaves in nations that harbor them." "Rhetoric," the report maintains, "is no substitute for strong, effective, action."

Threatening military action may be a cynical means for dealing with the anger of relatives of the victims. In April 1989, during a meeting with representatives of the relatives, Bush reportedly offered the unsolicited statement that if "the fingers [of guilt] point to state terrorism," there would be a retaliatory strike like the one the Reagan administration launched against Libya.

Behind the grandstanding, the report focuses serious criticisms on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Commission found the FAA to be "a reactive agency – preoccupied with responses to events to the exclusion of adequate contingency planning in anticipation of future threats."

In all, the report contained more than 50 specific proposals designed to improve airline safety and thwart terrorist attacks. Some of the proposals will go to the President as recommendations for action by executive order, while others will be introduced in Congress.

And while it was not included in the Commission's report, the FAA was clearly inclined to meet at least one demand voiced by the victims' relatives: On May 10, an FAA spokesman announced that Raymond Salazar, its director of civil aviation security since 1986, would be leaving his post to become the director of the FAA's Center for Management Development in Palm Coast, Florida. An FAA spokesman claimed the move had nothing to do with criticisms arising from Pan Am 103.

According to the executive summary of the nearly 200-page Commission report, the bomb was "probably" placed aboard at Frankfurt. The summary also states that "a partially filled, unguarded baggage container... was later loaded on the flight at Heathrow." That container, according to Commission head Ann McLaughlin, sat unattended for at least half an hour. "The international criminal investigation has not yet determined precisely how the device was loaded onto the plane," the report says.

While the Commission harshly criticizes both the FAA and Pan Am, it lets the U.S. intelligence community off the hook. "The Commission's review showed that no warnings specific to Flight 103 were received by U.S. intelligence agencies from any source at anytime," it reports. And it repeats testimony presented to the Commission by the CIA claiming that the agency "did not send anyone to the [crash] site."

Indeed, an important part of the Commission's report will remain unknown. Part of the body's conclusions – apparently related to a call for more aggressive covert operations intended to prevent or respond to terrorist acts – was sent to the President in a classified letter.

### The Remaining Puzzles

Is the story of Pan Am 103 that some U.S. government, U.N. officials, and foreign leaders were spared because they had access to information indicating that the flight was threatened, while the traveling public was kept in the dark? Is it the case that in their rush to make flight schedules and cut costs, Pan Am allowed bags that had not been properly searched to be loaded on its plane?

Is it, as Interfor maintains, that a rogue CIA operation trying to free U.S. hostages by protecting a heroin smuggling ring failed to prevent the bomb from going on board?

Is it, as *Frontline* suggests, that experienced U.S. intelligence operatives made fatal security mistakes? Is the CIA trying to hide the fact that it could not bring its people home from Beirut safely?

Whatever the answer may be, many relatives of the victims fear they will never know what allowed the bombing to happen or see those responsible punished. An April 1990 letter to George Bush and Margaret Thatcher, cosigned by Paul Hudson and Jim Swire, co-chairs of "U.K. Families-Flight 103," spoke of the "entirely believable published accounts [that]... both of you have decided to deliberately downplay the evidence and string out the investigation until the case can be dismissed as ancient history."

## Foreign Intelligence in the U.S.: The Marcos Network and Murder

**by Dan Junas***

On June 1, 1981, two Filipino-American union officials were gunned down with a hand-held Mac-10 automatic weapon in their union hall in Seattle, Washington's historic Pioneer Square district. Gene Viernes died on the spot, but his friend Silme Domingo lived long enough to name his assailants, members of the Filipino Tulisan Gang.

Domingo and Viernes had recently been elected on a reform slate as Secretary-Treasurer and Dispatcher, respectively, of Local 37 of the International Longshoremen Workers Union (ILWU), which represents predominantly Filipino workers in the Alaska fish canneries. Law enforcement officials assumed that the motive for the double murder was the Tulisan gang's resentment over Domingo and Viernes's efforts to reform the union's dispatch system.

Domingo and Viernes, however, had also been using their position in the union to challenge the power of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. In fact, they had been threatening the so-called conjugal dictators far more than even Domingo and Viernes realized. Friends and family of the slain activists, who refused to believe that the murders were motivated by a simple "dispute over dispatch," immediately formed the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes (CJDV). Led by Silme's sister Cynthia and Silme's and Gene's friend, attorney Michael Withey, the CJDV conducted an extensive investigation that culminated in a civil law suit against the Marcoses.

In December 1989, eight and a half years after the murders, a jury found that the Marcoses were indeed liable for the deaths of Domingo and Viernes and awarded the plaintiffs – the families of Domingo and Viernes – $15 million.

The trial established a profound precedent in international law. For the first time, a foreign dictator was deposed, tried, and held legally liable for crimes committed while in office.

Perhaps even more profound than the legal precedent was evidence presented in the case which showed that the Philippine intelligence apparatus had operated in this country, against U.S. citizens, with the complicity of the U. S. government. The Committee for Justice demonstrated clearly how a U.S. foreign policy that disrespects human rights abroad diminishes human rights at home.

Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in the Philippines in September 1972, as a way of avoiding the constitutional provision requiring him to step down after two terms in office. A central premise of the plaintiffs' case was that the murder of Domingo and Viernes represented nothing less than an extension of the Marcos regime into the United States. For that reason, the current Foreign Minister of the Philippines, Raul Manglapus, who was himself a target of the Marcos network in the U.S., testified by videotape about the pattern of arbitrary detention, torture, disappearances, and "salvaging," or summary execution, of those who opposed the Marcos dictatorship. The plaintiffs then presented an overwhelming body of evidence that drew a vivid connection between abuses committed by Marcos in the Philippines and those committed by his network in this country.

### Modus Operandi

Because the plaintiffs were attempting to prove the existence of a conspiracy, they were permitted to introduce broad-ranging evidence on the activities of the Marcos intelligence network, including material that had only an indirect bearing on the case of Domingo and Viernes. Former CIA officer Ralph McGehee, who was called as an expert witness on intelligence, testified that Marcos was indeed conducting covert operations in the United States. Like the CIA, Marcos agents often used diplomatic cover, particularly at consulates in cities with large Filipino populations, such as San Francisco, Honolulu, and Seattle. And like the CIA, the Marcoses faced the problem of laundering funds. Marcos thus established the Philippines Bank of California in San Francisco with his crony, Juan Ponce Enrile, on the board of directors.

McGehee also testified that there are four types of covert operations: political, economic, psychological, and paramilitary (which includes assassination). In the course of the trial, evidence was presented showing that the Marcos network engaged in all four types. The plaintiffs' emphasis, however, was on instances of surveillance, intimidation, harassment and assassination of anti-Marcos activists in such organizations as the Anti-Martial Law Coalition (AMLC), Movement for a Free Philippines (MFP), Friends of the Filipino People (FFP), and the Union of Democratic Filipinos (KDP), to which Domingo and Viernes belonged.

One exile, Geline Avila, who was active in the AMLC and worked closely with Domingo and Viernes, testified about her own experiences with the Marcos network. Surveillance by Marcos agents "was a way of life," and she often received anonymous phone calls telling her, "We know about your relatives in the Philippines." She also described numerous instances when Marcos agents surveilled and harassed demonstrators protesting against the Marcos regime. Cars were vandalized during the demonstrations, and in one case "body-builders" were employed to intimidate the protesters.

The plaintiffs placed special emphasis, however, on three chief targets of the Marcos network, drawing a parallel between their cases and that of Domingo and Viernes. Taken together, these four cases and the circumstances surrounding them help provide an overview of the rise and fall of the Marcos network.

### The Conjugal Dictators

Primitivo Mijares had been Marcos's chief censor but he broke with Marcos when he became disenchanted with Marcos's abuses. He authored a book, *The Conjugal Dictators*, which was deeply embarrassing to the Marcoses. In 1975, when Mijares was about to further embarrass the Marcoses by testifying before then-Representative Donald Fraser's Subcommittee on International Organizations, Marcos agents offered him a $50,000 bribe not to testify. Mijares refused. Then on January 7, 1977 Mijares, who was last seen in the company of a Marcos agent, disappeared.

Although the Marcos bribery attempt presented solid evidence of an illegal attempt to interfere with a federal witness, no action was taken by U.S. authorities. [^1] Meanwhile, the Fraser Committee also heard testimony that led to the so-called "Koreagate" scandal. The Fraser Committee's investigation revealed that KCIA agents (the Korean equivalent of the CIA), as well as followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, were also conducting illegal intelligence operations in the United States and enjoyed at least the tacit support of the U.S. covert establishment. [^2]

In 1979 a U.S. Senate investigation focused on intelligence agencies of five countries – Iran, Chile, Taiwan, Yugoslavia, and the Philippines – conducting "systematic campaigns inside the United States to spy on, harass, and in some cases plan assasinations." [^3] The Senate report was never released and remains classified to this day. Portions, however, were leaked to the *Washington Post* and to columnist Jack Anderson.

The *Washington Post* article noted that four of the "spy outfits [Iran, Philippines, Taiwan, and Chile] had an important common feature. All had intelligence liaison agreements with the CIA, and they operated with a relatively free hand here [in the U.S.]." [^4] The article also noted that "the pattern of 'harassment and intimidation' of dissidents had had a 'chilling effect' on public discussion and attitudes in this country toward governments with controversial human rights records at home."

After this illegal intelligence activity became public knowledge, the Carter administration made a mild effort to crack down. An August 15, 1979 "Eyes Only" U.S. State Department cable, from U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Richard Murphy to Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, described Murphy's effort in August 1979 to persuade Marcos to discontinue his network's activity in the U.S. Murphy "stressed [the] near disaster wrought by Koreagate to ROK-USG [Republic of Korea-U.S. government] relations," and he presented Marcos with a copy of a Jack Anderson column on Philippine agents. Marcos, Murphy reported, "sought [to] allay any concerns we might have about his authorizing physical violence by Philippine intelligence agents," although "he skirted the more slippery issues of harassment and intimidation of Filipinos in the U.S."

The cable also provided evidence that would be crucial in establishing Marcos's liability in the Domingo and Viernes case. Murphy reported that other than top Marcos security chief General Fabian Ver, "there is no other senior GOP [Government of the Philippines] official with responsibility" for the actions of the Marcos network in the United States.

### The Case of Steve Psinakis

One anti-Marcos activist who experienced harassment and intimidation at the hands of the Marcos network was Steve Psinakis. Psinakis, a Greek-born engineer, had married the daughter of Eugenio Lopez, one of the wealthiest men in the Philippines. Lopez owned a broadcast network as well as the Manila Chronicle, which had criticized the abuses of the Marcos regime. When Marcos declared martial law Lopez was vacationing in the United States, where he chose to remain. But in November 1972 Marcos had Lopez's son, Eugenio Jr., arrested without charges. Marcos began blackmailing the family, forcing them to desist from criticizing the martial law regime and to turn over their financial assets to Marcos cronies. In November 1974, when Marcos's demands had been met but Eugenio Jr. was not released, the family made a decision to make his case public, and Eugenio Jr. began a hunger strike.

During the period of blackmail, Psinakis, who had come to the United States from Greece when martial law was declared, was in touch with Raul Manglapus and other leaders of the anti-Marcos movement in the U.S. After the hunger strike began, Psinakis acted openly, including working with the MFP, exposing the Mijares bribery attempt and writing a column for the *Philippine News*.

The *Philippine News* was an anti-Marcos weekly published in San Francisco, and, as Psinakis testified, Marcos sought to silence it. In an example of an economic covert operation that curtailed freedom of the press in the United States, Marcos agents pressured businesses that advertised in the *Philippine News* – mostly travel agents dependent on the Philippines consulate for business – to "pull their ads or suffer the consequences."

Psinakis himself also received threatening, late-night phone calls, and in October 1979 his life was directly threatened. Shortly after a Movement for a Free Philippines convention, where new steps were taken against the Marcos dictatorship, Psinakis was driving to a restaurant in San Francisco's financial district. Two men pulled up next to him, and the man closest to him raised a gun to his temple and told him, "This is to show you how easy it is to stop your activities."

Psinakis reported the incident to the FBI, although he expected them to take no action. Indeed, after Ronald Reagan was elected president, the FBI itself would be taking action against Psinakis.

### Reagan, Marcos, and Friendly States

The Carter administration had criticized the Marcos regime's human rights abuses in the Philippines and objected to his illegal intelligence network in the United States. Under Reagan, however, the Marcos regime enjoyed much greater freedom of action. A confidential memo, from the Embassy of the Philippines in Washington prepared after Reagan's election, noted that "human rights will not be the sole criterion in making policy determinations toward friendly states." Instead, the Reagan administration would emphasize combatting terrorism.

Marcos was quick to take advantage of this new policy line. Shortly after Reagan was elected, Marcos announced that he "would file a 'formal protest' with the United States government and 'demand that action be taken' against Filipino and American citizens in the United States," whom Marcos claimed were responsible for the actions of urban guerrillas in Manila. [^5]

The Philippine Embassy's memo provided an analysis that justified this action, claiming that anti-Marcos activists in the U.S. had "definitely adopted a radical change in their general policy, shifting from peaceful means to outright violence as a way of bringing about the political change they desire to effect in the Republic [of the Philippines]."

What was really changing, of course, was not the tactics of the opposition, but rather the tactics of the Reagan and Marcos administrations. In December 1980, according to a legal brief filed by Psinakis's lawyers in U.S. District Court, Imelda Marcos met with Psinakis and Marcos opposition leaders Senators Benigno Aquino (the late husband of current Philippines President Corazon Aquino) and Heherson Alvarez.

Mrs. Marcos attempted in those meetings to convince and coerce Psinakis, Aquino, and Alvarez to curtail their criticisms of the Marcos regime. She told each of them that she had received from President-elect Reagan and Vice President-elect Bush their commitment to support the martial law regime in the Philippines, and their further specific commitment to investigate and prosecute Marcos's opponents in the United States. [^6]

> ### After the inauguration, the Reagan administration indeed made a political decision to support the Marcos dictatorship by agreeing to investigate and prosecute Marcos's opponents in the United States.

After the inaugural, according to the same brief, the Reagan administration indeed made a political decision to support the Marcos dictatorship by agreeing to investigate and prosecute Marcos's opponents in the United States. Those opponents included the late Senator Benigno Aquino, Raul Manglapus, Mr. Psinakis, and others. The United States federal investigation was fueled by so-called "evidence" supplied by Marcos to the administration in the United States. Marcos agents and United States government agents collaborated to generate, for political reasons, testimony in the United States against the leaders of the U.S-based opposition to the Marcos dictatorship. [^7]

In 1986, Psinakis was indicted on charges of sending explosives to the Philippines to be used in an anti-Marcos plot. The evidence used against him included remnants of detonation cord and wrappings of packages in which high explosive powder and cord had allegedly been shipped to Psinakis dated from searches supposedly made in 1981. On June 7, 1989, however, Psinakis was found innocent of all charges. [^8]

In an effort to show the Marcos regime in its true light, Psinakis's attorneys introduced into evidence examples of Filipino state-sponsored terrorism. One of these more infamous events was the murder of Benigno Aquino. Sen. Aquino was Marcos's most serious political rival in the Philippines, and originally Marcos had him imprisoned. Later, Marcos permitted Aquino to go to the United States for medical treatment, and after he recovered, Aquino became a vocal opponent of the Marcos regime.

In early 1983 Aquino decided to return to the Philippines, but he was murdered at the airport immediately after he arrived in Manila. The Philippine government commission which investigated the murder, found General Fabian Ver responsible. Ver first denied, but later admitted, that Aquino had been surveilled in the United States. The Agrava Commission found that this surveillance had played an important part in the assassination.

> ### In the United States, four different Philippine intelligence agencies collected information on the anti-Marcos opposition movement in the United States.

In the United States, four different Philippine intelligence agencies collected information on the anti-Marcos opposition movement in the United States. And as early as March 1981 – shortly after Reagan took office – "new, high-level and Philippine intelligence agents were selected for assignment in the United States with the mission of monitoring and 'operating against' anti-Marcos Philippine dissidents." [^9]

After the ILWU convention, two individuals in particular would "operate against" Domingo and Viernes. One was Constantine "Tony" Baruso, the President of Local 37. He, like Marcos, was born in the Ilocos region of the Philippines, and was known in the Filipino community as a staunch Marcos loyalist. And he was, according to Gillego's testimony, also an asset of the Marcos intelligence network.

*(Image: Tony Baruso, implicated in Domingo and Viernes murder. Credit: John Stamets)*

The other was San Francisco physician, Dr. Leonilo Malabed. He was a childhood friend of Marcos's, and he was known as "the eyes and ears of Marcos" in the United States.

Evidence pointing toward Malabed had been uncovered by Gillego after the fall of Marcos. Gillego had been appointed by President Aquino to the Presidential Commission on Good Government, which was attempting to recover the wealth Marcos had stolen from the Philippines. In that capacity, Gillego had the opportunity to review documents seized by U.S. Customs from the Marcoses after they fled the Philippines. Among those documents was a statement of expenses for the Mabuhay Corporation of San Francisco, California, which Gillego recognized as a front organization in the Marcos network. The Mabuhay Corporation provided a cover for an intelligence slush fund controlled by Malabed.

The Mabuhay statement showed an expenditure of $15,000 on May 17, 1981, within weeks of the ILWU convention, for a "special security project." This item coincided with a trip that Baruso had made to San Francisco. The plaintiffs argued that the $15,000 was paid to Baruso to arrange the murder of Domingo and Viernes. Although Malabed denied participation in the murder, he "produced no credible evidence" explaining this payment. [^10]

On May 30, Baruso met privately with Fortunato "Tony" Dictado, leader of the Filipino Tulisan Gang. On June 1, 1981, Dictado and gang members Jimmy Ramil, Ben Guloy, and Teodorico Domingues (also known as Boy Pilay) went to the Local 37 union hall in Pioneer Square. Ramil, Guloy and Pilay entered the hall and shot and killed Domingo and Viernes. The murder weapon was a Mac-10 .45 caliber automatic weapon belonging to Tony Baruso.

Ramil, Guloy, and Dictado were later convicted of the murder, and Pilay, who testified at the murder trial, was himself murdered in January 1983. Baruso, curiously, was never charged. In the Domingo/Viernes trial, the plaintiffs presented evidence of Baruso's direct involvement in the murder that was, according to the judge, "overwhelming." [^11] Yet the King County Prosecutor's Office, with vastly superior resources at its disposal, simply claimed that it had lacked "sufficient evidence" to charge Baruso, suggesting that perhaps the prosecutor's office had succumbed to outside political pressure not to pursue the case. King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng refused to be interviewed to discuss this possibility, but his spokesman denied that political considerations had played a role and said that as a result of the recent trial, Baruso's case is being reevaluated.

In the case of Domingo and Viernes, the jury held the Marcoses liable and the judge found that Marcos agents Baruso and Malabed were liable as well. In the decision the judge concluded that the plaintiffs have provided clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the Marcoses created and controlled an intelligence operation which plotted the murders of Domingo and Viernes and that Mabuhay funds were paid to Baruso and used to perpetrate the assassination. [^12]

It is ironic that "Mabuhay" is a Filipino toast that means "long life." It is a further irony that within a month of the murders then-Vice President George Bush toasted Marcos, stating that: "We love your adherence to democratic principles and processes."

Perhaps the greatest irony, however, lies in the concept of national security. In the course of their investigation, CJDV uncovered evidence that the FBI was aware of "assassination plots and/or threats of physical violence or kidnapping against members of the anti-Marcos opposition in the United States." [^13] Yet instead of exposing and combatting this terrorism the United States government at best looked the other way, and at worst actively collaborated in it.

"Liaison" arrangements with the foreign intelligence agencies of repressive regimes are tolerated – and kept secret – on grounds of "national security." As a result, U.S. citizens are subject to the same kinds of heinous covert actions that U.S. intelligence agencies perpetrate in foreign countries.

In theory, the doctrine of national security is supposed to protect life and liberty. In the case of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, it did just the opposite.

## Domestic Surveillance: The History of Operation CHAOS

**by Verne Lyon***

For over fifteen years, the CIA, with assistance from numerous government agencies, conducted a massive illegal domestic covert operation called Operation CHAOS. It was one of the largest and most pervasive domestic surveillance programs in the history of this country. Throughout the duration of CHAOS, the CIA spied on thousands of U.S. citizens. The CIA went to great lenghts to conceal this operation from the public while every president from Eisenhower to Nixon exploited CHAOS for his own political ends.

One can trace the beginnings of Operation CHAOS to 1959 when Eisenhower used the CIA to "sound out" the exiles who were fleeing Cuba after the triumph of Fidel Castro's revolution. Most were wealthy educated professionals looking for a sympathetic ear in the United States. The CIA sought contacts in the exile community and began to recruit many of them for future use against Castro. This U.S.-based recruiting operation was arguably illegal, although Eisenhower forced FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to accept it as a legitimate CIA function. Congress and the public showed no interest in who was recruiting whom.

The CIA's Office of Security was monitoring other groups at this time and had recruited agents within different émigré organizations. [^1] The CIA considered this a normal extension of its authorized infiltration of dissident groups abroad even though the activity was taking place within the U.S. Increased use of the CIA's contacts and agents among the Cuban exiles became commonplace until mass, open recruitment of mercenaries for what was to be the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion was no longer a secret in southern Florida. It was no secret to Fidel Castro either, as we later found out.

This activity led the CIA to establish proprietary companies, fronts, and covers for its domestic operations. So widespread did they become that President Johnson allowed the then CIA Director, John McCone, to create in 1964 a new super-secret branch called the Domestic Operations Division (DOD), the very title of which mocked the explicit intent of Congress to prohibit CIA operations inside the U.S. [^2] This disdain for Congress permeated the upper echelons of the CIA. Congress could not hinder or regulate something it did not know about, and neither the President nor the Director of the CIA was about to tell them. Neither was J. Edgar Hoover, even though he was generally aware that the CIA was moving in on what was supposed to be exclusive FBI turf. [^3]

In the classified document creating the DOD, the scope of its activities were to "exercise centralized responsibility for the direction, support, and coordination of clandestine operational activities within the United States...." One of those was burglarizing foreign diplomatic sites at the request of the National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA also expanded the role of its "quasi-legal" Domestic Contact Service (DCS), an operation designed to brief and debrief selected American citizens who had traveled abroad in sensitive areas of intelligence interest. Because the interviews took place in airports between the aircraft and customs and immigration control, the operations were not technically considered domestic. The DCS also helped with travel control by monitoring the arrivals and departures of U.S. nationals and foreigners. In addition, the CIA reached out to former agents, officers, contacts, and friends to help it run its many fronts, covers, and phony corporations. This "old boy network" provided the CIA with trusted people to carry out its illegal domestic activities.

### The Justification

With the DCS, the DOD, the old boy network, and the CIA Office of Security operating without congressional oversight or public knowledge, all that was needed to bring it together was a perceived threat to the national security and a presidential directive unleashing the dogs. That happened in 1965 when President Johnson instructed McCone to provide an independent analysis of the growing problem of student protest against the war in Vietnam. Prior to this, Johnson had to rely on information provided by the FBI, intelligence that he perceived to be slanted by Hoover's personal views, which often ignored the facts. Because Hoover insisted that international communism was manipulating student protest, Johnson ordered the CIA to confirm or deny his allegations. All the pieces now came together.

To achieve the intelligence being asked for by the President, the CIA's Office of Security, the Counter-Intelligence division, and the newly created DOD turned to the old boy network for help. Many were old Office of Strategic Services people who had achieved positions of prominence in the business, labor, banking, and academic communities. In the academic arena, the CIA sought their own set of "eyes and ears" on many major college and university campuses. The FBI was already actively collecting domestic intelligence in the same academic settings. The difference between the intelligence being gathered was like night and day. The FBI Special Agents and their informers were looking for information that would prove Hoover's theory. The CIA wanted to be more objective. [^4]

In April 1965, Johnson appointed Vice-Admiral William Raborn CIA Director (DCI, or Director of Central Intelligence) and Richard Helms Deputy Director. Since Raborn's days at the helm of the CIA seemed numbered from the outset, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of domestic operations; that was left to Helms, a career intelligence officer who had come up through the ranks – he had been Deputy Director for Plans (DDP) since 1962 and Deputy DCI from 1965-66 – and who could be trusted. Helms became DCI in June 1966. As Deputy Director, he had allowed the CIA slowly to expand its domestic intelligence operations and understood his orders from President Johnson were to collect intelligence on college and university campuses with no governing guidelines other than "don't get caught." Helms now had a free hand to implement Johnson's orders and, by August 1967, the illegal collection of domestic intelligence had become so large and widespread that he was forced to create a Special Operations Group (SOG). The SOG was imbedded in the DDP's counterintelligence division and provided, data on the U.S. peace movement to the Office of Current Intelligence on a regular basis. [^5]

As campus antiwar protest activity spread across the nation, the CIA reacted by implementing two new domestic operations. The first, Project RESISTANCE, was designed to provide security to CIA recruiters on college campuses. Under this program, the CIA sought active cooperation from college administrators, campus security, and local police to help identify antiwar activists, political dissidents, and "radicals." Eventually information was provided to all government recruiters on college campuses and directly to the super-secret DOD on thousands of students and dozens of groups. The CIA's Office of Security also created Project MERRIMAC, to provide warnings about demonstrations being carried out against CIA facilities or personnel in the Washington area. [^6]

Under both Projects, the CIA infiltrated agents into domestic groups of all types and activities. It used its contacts with local police departments and their intelligence units to pick up its "police skills" and began in earnest to pull off burglaries, illegal entries, use of explosives, criminal frameups, shared interrogations, and disinformation. CIA teams purchased sophisticated equipment for many starved police departments and in return got to see arrest records, suspect lists, and intelligence reports. Many large police departments, in conjunction with the CIA, carried out illegal, warrantless searches of private properties, to provide intelligence for a report requested by President Johnson and later entitled "Restless Youth." [^7]

SOG was being directed by Richard Ober, a CIA person with an established record of domestic intelligence operations in academia. When *Ramparts* magazine disclosed the relationship between the National Student Association and the CIA in early 1967, Ober was assigned to investigate the magazine's staff members, their friends, and possible connections with foreign intelligence agencies. [^8]

In July 1968, Helms decided to consolidate all CIA domestic intelligence operations under one program and title. The new operation was called CHAOS and Ober was in charge. [^9] Its activities greatly expanded from then on – at the urging not only of President Johnson, but also his main advisers Dean Rusk and Walt Rostow. Both men were convinced that Hoover was right and foreign intelligence agencies were involved in antiwar protests in the U.S. Johnson was not convinced and wanted the CIA's intelligence in order to compare it with that provided by the FBI.

### The Nixon Administration

After Richard Nixon took office in January 1969, Helms continued operations with the assurance that nothing would ever be leaked to the public. But he began to face pressure from two opposing factions within the CIA community. One wanted to expand domestic operations even more, while the other reminded him that Operation CHAOS and similar activities were well "over the line" of illegality and outside the CIA's charter. To put a damper on this internal dissent, Helms ordered Ober to stop discussing these activities with his direct boss in counterintelligence, James Jesus Angleton. The internal protests continued, however, as White House aide and staunch anti-communist Tom Charles Huston, pressed for ever increasing domestic operations.

Huston was eager to expand Operation CHAOS to include overseas agents and to "share" intelligence with the FBI's intelligence division, directed by William Sullivan. There were more than 50 CHAOS agents now, many receiving several weeks of assignment and training in overseas positions to establish their covers as radicals. "Once they returned to the U.S. and enrolled in colleges and universities, they had the proper "credentials."

In June 1970 Nixon met with Hoover, Helms, NSA Director Admiral Noel Gaylor, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) representative Lt. Gen. Donald V. Bennett and told them he wanted a coordinated and concentrated effort against domestic dissenters. To do that, he was creating the Interagency Committee on Intelligence (ICI), chaired by Hoover. The first ICI report, in late June, recommended new efforts in "black bag operations," wiretapping, and a mail-opening program. In late July 1970, Huston told the members of the ICI that their recommendations had been accepted by the White House. [^10]

John Dean replaced Tom Huston as White House aide in charge of domestic intelligence, and at his urging, a Justice Department group, the Intelligence Evaluation Committee, was established to study domestic groups, over Hoover's protest. Deteriorating relations between the FBI and the other intelligence agencies, especially the CIA, caused Hoover to fire William Sullivan. At that time, Sullivan was the liaison officer between the FBI and the other intelligence agencies and he strongly favored the expansion of domestic operations.

### Second Thoughts

Even Helms began to have second thoughts about how large CHAOS had grown, but Nixon made it clear to him that the CIA was a presidential tool he wanted at his disposal. Helms got the message, yet he also understood the growing uneasiness in other government circles. In 1972, the CIA's Inspector General wrote a report that expressed concern about Operation CHAOS in the following way; "...we also encountered general concern over what appeared to be a monitoring of the political views and activities of Americans not known to be or suspected of being involved in espionage.... Stations were asked to report on the whereabouts and activities of prominent persons... whose comings and goings were not only in the public domain, but for whom allegations of subversion seemed sufficiently nebulous to raise renewed doubts as to the nature and legitimacy of the CHAOS program." [^11]

Helms was being squeezed by White House demands to expand Operation CHAOS and the fear that the whole question of domestic operations was going to become public knowledge, as Hoover feared. Helms found himself constantly shoring up one lie with another and then another. He found himself deceiving Congress and lying to the public as well as CIA employees. In March 1971, a group of young CIA executives known as the Management Advisory Group (MAG) protested Operation CHAOS and similar domestic operations by issuing a statement saying, "MAG opposes any Agency activity which could be construed as targeted against any person who enjoys the protection of the U.S. Constitution...whether or not he resides in the United States." [^12]

Helms of course denied the CIA was involved in domestic operations, or using basic American institutions such as the Peace Corps, the business community, or the media as covers for CIA operations. Just a few years later, Oswald Johnston of the *Washington Star* reported that over 35 American journalists, some full-time, some free-lance, and some major media correspondents were on the CIA payroll. And in 1974 the CIA admitted that over two hundred CIA agents were operating overseas posing as businessmen. [^13]

### Campus Surveillance

> The unleashing of the CIA and my concerns about the escalating war in Southeast Asia crossed paths on the Iowa State University campus in the fall of 1965. I do not know why I was chosen for recruitment, or by whom; only the CIA's old boy network on campus knows what criteria were used, what psychological profile was followed, and what future need of the CIA went into the initial selection process.
>
> There were no posters, no ads in local or campus newspapers, nor any notice in the college placement office. The CIA came purporting to be representatives of legitimate business concerns that would normally conduct job interviews on campus. The only advance notice of the "interview" was a letter on what appeared to be real company letterhead saying that such-and-such company was interested in offering you a job. Only after accepting the interview and signing several documents stating you would never reveal anything about the exclusive job offer being made would the interviewers tell you whom they really represented. By then you were trapped into eternal secrecy even if you declined their offer. You could not even approach the university's administration or placement office to complain about the deception.
>
> For the student or faculty member who accepted the CIA's offer to spy, the payments offered were tailored to the individual. In some cases it was only money; in others it may be have been a guaranteed draft deferment, research assistance grants, a future career with the CIA, patriotism, duty, or any combination. Short on money, plus wanting to serve my country without being sent to stop a bullet in a rice paddy halfway around the world, I listened intently to their pitch. I was hooked with an offer of an undeclared $300 cash in an envelope each month plus a guaranteed draft deferment and an offer of a bright future with the Company.
>
> In exchange, I was asked to do several things while admonished to maintain absolute secrecy about my intelligence gathering activities, the CIA, and any working relationship between us. I was persuaded to believe that the nation was facing a major crisis because of the student unrest and ensuing protests and that even though such activities were permitted in our "free" country, we should not allow foreigners and/or communists to pull the strings if they were involved.
>
> My campus missions included monitoring selected students; obtaining printed materials from student protest groups, including membership and donor lists and programs of planned actions and protests; gathering information on the private sexual activities of selected students or faculty, and on the student visa status of selected foreign students; and learning the identities of visiting "travelling agitators" from other colleges and universities.
>
> Ethnic and racial groups were watched as well as student radical movements. No guidelines were given that differentiated between what was legitimate protest and what constituted a perceived threat to national security. This allowed the CIA to expand its domestic surveillance to cover draft resistance organizations, military deserters, non-mainstream newspapers and publications, most Black militant groups, and U.S. citizens travelling abroad. Most domestic political activity was also covered if it showed any sign of differing from the "American tradition."
>
> My entire senior year found me caught up in this illegal domestic covert operation. It changed my personality, my political point of view, and my way of thinking about the structure and role of the different branches of our federal government, and it taught me to what lengths the government would go to hide illegal wrongdoings under the cloak of national security.

### The Collapse of the House of Cards

The web of deception, misinformation, lies, and illegal domestic activities began to unravel with speed in the summer of 1972 when Howard Osborn, then Chief of Security for the CIA, informed Helms that two former CIA officers, E. Howard Hunt and James McCord, were involved in a burglary at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. The house of cards was about to come crashing down and Helms now wanted to salvage what he could and distance himself from not only Watergate but also the domestic operations. He appointed CIA Executive Director William Colby to handle any investigations into the Agency's domestic operations and began to prepare for the inevitable.

Helms was called to Camp David by President Nixon and subsequently fired. His replacement was James Schlesinger (who would last but a few months). Schlesinger would be replaced in July 1973 by Colby, and Helms would become U.S. Ambassador to Iran to get him as far away as possible. In an effort at damage control, Colby decided that Operation CHAOS and Project RESISTANCE should be terminated.

In 1975 the CIA underwent public investigation and scrutiny by both the Church and Rockefeller committees. These investigations revealed considerable evidence showing that the CIA had carried out its activities with a tremendous disregard for the law, both in the U.S. and abroad.

During the life of Operation CHAOS, the CIA had compiled personality files on over 13,000 individuals – including more than 7,000 U.S. citizens – as well as files on over 1,000 domestic groups. [^14]

The CIA had shared information on more than 300,000 persons with different law enforcement agencies including the DIA and FBI. It had spied on, burglarized, intimidated, misinformed, lied to, deceived, and carried out criminal acts against thousands of citizens of the United States. It had placed itself above the law, above the Constitution, and in contempt of international diplomacy and the United States Congress. It had violated its charter and had contributed either directly or indirectly to the resignation of a President of the United States. It had tainted itself beyond hope.

Of all this, the CIA's blatant contempt for the rights of individuals was the worst. This record of deceit and illegality, implored Congress as well as the President to take extreme measures to control the Agency's activities. However, except for a few cosmetic changes made for public consumption – such as the Congressional intelligence oversight committee – nothing has been done to control the CIA. In fact, subsequent administrations have chosen to use the CIA for domestic operations as well. These renewed domestic operations began with Gerald Ford, were briefly limited by Jimmy Carter, and then extended dramatically by Ronald Reagan.

Any hope of curbing these illegal activities is scant. Recently, George Bush and current DCI William Webster announced for a the need to again target politcal enemies of the U.S. for assassination. It is ironic that Webster, a former Federal Judge, would chose to ignore the limits and contraints placed on the government by the Constitution. During his tenure as Director of the FBI, the bureau was once again involved in the infiltration of groups practicing their constutional right to dissent against U.S. government policies. Once again, the FBI compiled thousands of files on individuals protesting Reagan's war against Nicaragua and support for the genocidal Salvadoran military. Now, Webster is in a position of perhaps even greater power and, without doubt, would have no qualms about abusing it.

### Conclusion

Given the power granted to the office of the presidency and the unaccountability of the intelligence agencies, widespread illegal domestic operations are certain. We as a people should remember history and not repeat it. It is therefore essential that the CIA be reorganized and stripped of its covert operations capability. Effective congressional oversight is also an important condition for ending the misuse of the intelligence aparatus that has plagued every U.S. administration since the formation of the CIA.

A great deal is at risk – our personal freedoms as well as the viability of this society. The CIA must be put in its place. Should we demand or allow anything less, we will remain vulnerable to these abuses and face the risk of decaying into a lawless state destined to self-destruction.
