## Editorial

Last issue we noted that no CIA charter at all would be better than the one then working its way through Congress. It now seems that pressures from the right and left and the complexities of election year politics in the United States have all combined to achieve this result.

### Stalling and Dealing

At the time of the Church Committee Report in 1976, there were calls for massive intelligence reforms and serious restrictions on the CIA. By a sophisticated mixture of stalling, stonewalling, and deal-making, the CIA and its supporters managed, in three years, to reverse the trend completely. There were demands to "unleash" the CIA. A first draft charter proposed some new restrictions and relaxed some existing ones. The Administration, guided by the CIA, attacked all the restrictions. The Attorney General criticized "unnecessary restrictions," and hoped that "reason and good sense will prevail."

The Administration insisted on the removal of all the laws which the CIA found inconvenient. This led to a new version of the charter, discussed last issue, which was designed to exempt the CIA substantially, if not completely, from the Freedom of Information Act; to repeal the Hughes-Ryan Amendment, which required prior notice of covert actions to Congress; to criminalize disclosure of intelligence officers, agents and sources by both former employees and private citizens; and to authorize specifically a wide range of covert operations at home and abroad, including those directed at U.S. citizens.

### Overplaying Its Hand

Perhaps the CIA overplayed its hand. Bolstered by events in Iran and Afghanistan the Agency was not content to accept a "mixed" charter. By the beginning of 1980 journalists were convinced that no restrictions would pass. Accountability, suggested *Los Angeles Times* writer Robert Toth, would remain minimal and uncodified, and "Congress, responding to the crisis atmosphere during a short election-year session, will set aside the complex legal issues in the proposed charter while ending key restraints on the CIA and other intelligence agencies." It now seems that Toth was 100% wrong.

### The Disappearing Moral Issue

The major public debate involved prior notice. Should Congress be notified of major covert operations before they occurred? The cynicism of this focus has two facets. First of all, to a large extent the debate was fatuous. The CIA has always ignored reporting requirements whenever it felt it was necessary. Admiral Turner even told Congress this, angering Senate Majority Leader Byrd.

More importantly, the discussion of when to report covert actions ignored the moral issue of whether to undertake covert operations at all, or in what circumstances. We have taken the position that in nearly any conceivable circumstance, covert actions are morally wrong. They involve the manipulation of events in other countries, events which should be left to the people of those countries to decide. There is little Congressional support for this view, and no discussion of it.

### The Specifics

As the CIA pressed for its "wish list," every proposal, fortunately, had its opponents. The FOIA exemption was supported by the Justice Department, but editorially the press fought this move, understanding the effects it would have on journalistic and historical research. The Anti-Agee bill was pressed, but some columnists, such as Tom Wicker of the *New York Times*, noted that journalists, even if not covered by the law, would be subject to grand jury harassment to discover the sources of leaks.

[Image: A drawing of a hand holding a pen, writing on a document that has an American flag design.]

The debate over the use of journalists, academics, and clergy was heated. Admiral Turner, speaking before a gathering of the nation's major editors, shocked his audience by insisting that "in unusual circumstances" it was entirely proper for the CIA to use journalists as agents. He even announced that he had approved plans to use journalists three times in the recent past, contrary to assurances given publicly several years earlier by William Colby.

To justify the use of clergy, the CIA used its supporters from the far right. Ernest W. Lefever of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, co-author of "The CIA and the American Ethic," argued that "a garbage mechanic, a politician, and a preacher should all have an equal right to be patriotic." He said with a straight face that "giving information to the CIA is like reporting a fire, the presence of a suspicious person, or a crime in one's neighborhood." Once again the hamhanded approach backfired, and the National Council of Churches and other religious groups attacked the proposed use of the clergy. Senator Moynihan countered by announcing his intention to introduce a flat prohibition against such activity.

### The Work of the Left

Throughout this debate, considerable and effective pressures were brought to bear by the organized opposition to government spying. The Campaign for Political Rights (to which CAIB belongs), the Center for National Security Studies, the American Civil Liberties Union, all gathered support against the charter. Many professional associations were educated and convinced of the dangers to their work from the charter. The struggle, to the surprise of many, began to have results. By April, the charter was "dead."

### The "Death" of the Charter

By mid-April it was clear that a comprehensive charter could not get through Congress. Senator Huddleston, chairman of the charter drafting subcommittee, announced that it was being abandoned. The Committee was to work on a short bill which included only Congressional oversight, the Anti-Agee bill, the repeal of Hughes-Ryan, and the FOIA exemption. It looked like the CIA's tactics had worked. Everything it wanted, and nothing else, would pass. But observers failed to realize that the same forces which had made a charter impossible were also likely to doom such piecemeal legislation. A watered-down version of prior notice and oversight was approved—with ambiguous language which meant different things to different people. Prior notice of "significant anticipated intelligence activity" ("special activities," the new name for covert action), must be given to the intelligence committees, but disclosures are only "to the extent consistent with due regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of classified information and information relating to intelligence sources and methods."

When it came to the other provisions, however, disunity was apparent. When Senator Chafee said that he wanted the Anti-Agee bill added, Senator Moynihan indicated he wanted the prohibition against journalists. When the FOIA exemption was brought up, there was objection. Finally, Senator Bayh stated that the only bill which had any chance of passage was the oversight law with no amendments whatsoever. Senator Chafee withdrew his motion when he was assured that the leadership of the Committee and the Senate would oppose any amendments on the floor.

### A Victory

Anything is possible on the floor of Congress, of course, but it appears that the threat to the continuation of the *Bulletin* has been averted, at least for the time being. Perhaps continued exposure of CIA abuses and our insistence that the Agency has not been reformed, will generate more movement in the proper direction.

## The Norwegian Connection: NORWAY, (UN)WILLING SPY FOR THE U.S.

**by F.G. Samia***

"Civil servants in the ministries of defense and foreign affairs and members of the defense staff misled both the government and the Storting [Parliament] in connection with the establishment of radio-navigation stations of the type Loran C and Omega on the coast of northern Norway in the years 1958 and 1965-66. Both projects were built to provide American nuclear submarines with navigational data."

With these words of introduction *Arbeiderbladet* [Worker's Daily], the national paper of the governing Labor Party, initiated on February 8, 1975 the so-called Hellebust case. Information for the article came from a thesis written by Army Intelligence Captain Aders Hellebust, that traced the development of Norway's military infrastructure. For the first time Norwegians heard the names Loran C and Omega, and the claim that these two secrecy-shrouded systems were in direct violation of Norway's 3-point basic non-aggression policy,¹ and jeopardizing their independence and safety.

Hellebust's revelations were only the tip of the Nordic iceberg however. Over the next three years more and more of it was explored and charted and its composition revealed, including: A massive secret electronic spy network operated by Norwegians for U.S. strategic purposes; complicity and deceit by government officials and the military; Gordon Liddy-type spy stories of CIA-financed Norwegian-trained skiing Finnish spies in James Bond chases with Russian patrols; arms caches for CIA-organized guerrilla groups, hidden in the wine cellars of millionaires in the employ of the Defense Ministry; secret agreements between the U.S. and Norwegian governments, and the deliberate misleading of scientists and researchers by the military and its U.S. liaisons; a "defense" system which created more dangers than it can deflect; CIA infiltration of Norway's Secret Service and government; and, most alarming of all, Norway's unwitting contribution to the new thinking in the Pentagon and other parts of official Washington that the U.S. could "win" a nuclear war.

As a result of the public debate sparked by Hellebust's case, a commission of inquiry was appointed by the Parliament, and its conclusions, known as the Schei Report (after the professor who chaired the commission) were classified secret and only a summary about half the length of the original was made public. The secret report was sent to the Parliament which one year and a half later, concluded that there was no reason to criticize any of the political authorities or the actions instrumental in the installation of the Loran C and Omega systems in Norway. The Left Socialist Party and a handful of ruling Labor Party members however, opposed this opinion, seeing an in-depth investigation as more important than parliamentary procedure. Leaks to the press in April 1976 and June 1977 gave details of the secret report as well as information from the secret Parliament meetings. And a rapid string of seemingly unrelated admissions and revelations during the summer of 1977 began to hint at the size and seriousness of the affair.

¹That is: No nuclear weapons, no foreign troops quartered permanently and no foreign bases on its soil, and no military exercises further east than the 24th parallel—a sort of demilitarized zone with the Soviet Union. Norway, while permitting no NATO forces there either, has had only a token of its own forces in the 250 kilometer area between it and the U.S.S.R. known as Finnmark, since this policy was adopted in 1949 when Norway joined NATO.

### The Short Hot Summer & Spooks in the Telephone Book

When Major Sven Blindheim stepped forward to confirm the claim made in an article published by *Ny Tid* [New Times] newspaper in July, 1977, that Norway had trained and equipped Finns who regularly crossed the Russian border from both Norway and Finland in the early 1950's for the purpose of spying, he was promptly arrested. This caused no little stir in itself, even among those who doubted the veracity of the report, since Blindheim is Norway's most decorated soldier and a national hero of the resistance against the Nazi occupation during WW II. Blindheim said he wasn't sure but thought that the money for this operation had come from the U.S. and NATO. The very next day Christen Christensen, editor of the arch-conservative newspaper *Morgenbladet* [Morning Paper] and a former member of the Security Service, said that he also had participated in this training, though defending it along with any other means of containment against the Soviet Union. Christensen corrected Blindheim in one area, however, saying that NATO was not involved in the funding. He, like Blindheim, was promptly arrested for breach of secrecy.

At nearly the same time in Finland, Esa Anttala was publishing a book² on his exploits as just such a spy. Written as a novel, it details his experiences including the training received in Norway, several day flights on skis from Russian Army patrols (and the bullet holes in his knapsack), the type of information he was asked to get, and contacts with CIA operatives.

The impact from all this had hardly been absorbed when the next wave broke over the Norwegian people.

Ivar Johansen, a free-lance journalist and peace activist, had begun as far back as 1972 to research on his own, and with rather unorthodox yet surprisingly effective methods, the existence of a chain of electronic super-spy stations in Norway directed against the U.S.S.R. Public knowledge—at least in those areas where the installations were located—had it that these were something more than "defense radio stations" or "communications research stations" as the occasional sign would proclaim.

The official position was that nothing of the sort existed. Johansen, using public information sources such as union files, civil service records, automobile registrations and even telephone directories, located and identified seven of the installations³, several of which were located in Finnmark or the "neutral" area, and catalogued the names of people working at them. In Vadso, a small fjord town just above the Arctic Circle, no less than 1500 of the 5000 living there worked at the huge listening station, and were only half-jokingly referred to as "spooks" by the rest of the townspeople.⁴

While preparing articles to document his findings, Johansen was arrested along with some assistants and all his material and files were confiscated. Together with two journalists from *Ny Tid*, he is currently facing trial for "endangering the national security" of Norway.

September added its special degrees to a summer already made hot by other than meterological events, when the liberal daily paper *Dagbladet* [The Daily] published an interview with former CIA operative Victor Marchetti. Marchetti not only confirmed the existence of this extensive electronic spy network but described its nature as being strategic as opposed to tactical. He said that the National Security Agency (NSA) had erected and operated these listening and intercept stations with the cooperation of the Norwegian Security Service; that CIA and NSA personnel were regularly on assignment at them; and, in a parenthetical confirmation, that the CIA had in fact provided the funds for the training of the Finnish spies by the Norwegians. Standard "Company" operating procedure, Marchetti said further, included the infiltration of every Western government and intelligence service, Norway being no exception.

A little more than one year later, in November 1978, local police, while looking for illegal distilleries, discovered a huge arms cache in a secret room of a villa outside Oslo belonging to Hans Otto Meyer, a wealthy retired ship owner. Meyer unraveled a story that had even police authorities shaking their heads in disbelief. He claimed to be an agent working for the Norwegian Secret Service and that the arms, cached with the full knowledge and consent of the Defense Ministry, were intended to supply "anti-communist" commando groups in the event that Norway were occupied by the Soviet Union. Any mirth was short-lived, however, because the Defense Ministry soon issued a statement that, while dismissing Meyer as an active agent (he was "retired" as "uncontrollable" in 1964), admitted the establishment of the so-called E-grupper (from Etterretningstjenesten—Norwegian intelligence agency) during the cold-war years of the late 40's-early 50's, and their purpose as "behind the lines" guerilla fighters. The groups were disbanded in the early 60's, they claimed, and the weapons—or at least most of them—were turned in. That these groups were established without either the consent or knowledge of the Parliament precipitated an ongoing debate as to their constitutionality.

Parliament members and citizens were upset enough with the discovery of quasi-nationalistic armed bands in their midst, when someone got hold of ex-CIA chief William Colby's memoirs published earlier in the year in the United States. In them, Colby reminisced about his long involvement with Scandinavia, citing among other things a parachute jump he made over Norway during World War II, operations he carried out as a young political Attache at the American Embassy in Stockholm nearly 30 years ago, and his part in establishing "resistance cells" in Norway at the beginning of the 1950's. Another floodgate was opened. Major Sven Blindheim, still under threat of prosecution for his revelations on the Finland case, acknowledged his participation in meetings held in London to set up the E-groups, with representatives of the British intelligence service, MI 6, and the CIA. Louis C. Sherer, the CIA's West European chief at the time, represented that organization in the operation financed under the code-name TRIPARTITE. The continued existence of these groups, though in altered form, was also now revealed, and new consideration was given to earlier "radical" analyses that their possible real purpose was to carry out a coup in the event that an anti-NATO government came to power during the 1950's, which, at the time, was a very distinct possibility. And the debate over constitutionality escalated to take in the existence, structure and purpose of the present-day groups.

### The Threat to Norway

That Norway, as the only other NATO land besides Turkey with a common border to the Soviet Union, is being used by the United States, and at grave risk to itself, is underscored by the nature of the spying. Tactical intelligence gathering for the defense of Norway and to fulfill its NATO role can be and is justified within bounds (see below, #4, "Types of Spying"). The long-term eclectic and penetrating strategic intelligence gathering provides continuous data to U.S. long-range military planning, however, which has no defensive relevance to Norway⁵, and which in fact contravenes its fundamental policies, cannot. In Turkey, the identical kinds of activity are carried out directly and openly by NSA personnel, whereas some Norwegian installations are so "secret" that no signs can be posted declaring them so—a definite advantage for peace researchers since, conversely, there can be no prohibitions such as photographing them. And even if eventually these installations were officially acknowledged, the U.S. would never dare to promote a similar status for them as for some of its Pacific bases; Okinawa and the Philippines, for example, where signs warn, "Guards in this area use live ammunition." The freedom and nature-loving Norwegians would never stand for that.

The theory often defensively used by NATO strategists that the U.S.S.R. wants (or would want) to occupy Finnmark is erroneous and misleading, say concerned Norwegians. Finnmark is militarily inhospitable terrain—though not completely so. Preventing the type of spying that is currently being done from northern Norway, to forestall a NATO and/or U.S. attack (against the submarine base at Murmansk, for example) based upon the information being gathered is more the reality that might provoke the Soviets. (These listening and intercept stations, remember, are in addition to the 100 or so acknowledged tactical installations emplaced in Norway as part of the NATO system.)

Norway's unequalled strategic value lies in its geographical position, to be sure, but in a way that also makes it highly vulnerable and, in the worst of situations, probably unavoidably expendable. In an attack on the U.S.S.R. by the U.S., a goodly portion of those missiles launched from the U.S., its non-mainland bases and missile-carrying submarines, by virtue of the earth's shape and the laws of telemetry, will go over the pole, not across the Atlantic, and thus over Norway and much of Scandinavia. The missile-triangulating and aiming stations located there then become crucial, as do other types of equipment such as those that "listen" to the blasts of detonating ICBMs to determine if they're targeted, possible duds, etc.

### Types of Spying

This description, far from complete or comprehensive, was compiled by peace researchers in Scandinavia, and lists the kinds of secret spying being done by Norwegians for the U.S., the interrelated systems, and some of the equipment used, and the locations of some of the installations.

1.  **COMINT—Communications Intelligence.**
    The interception of radio communications. One of the most usual activities of the NSA, which operates perhaps 2000 such intercept stations world-wide. Usually operated under pure military cover at military communications bases. This is not possible in Norway because the U.S. does not have any overt bases there. Norwegian Military Intelligence carries out this function with nearly 5000 of its own people employed in operating radio receivers and in decoding and translating the messages monitored. Large circular ground plan antenna arrays of high frequency, manufactured by Plessey, a British firm, are used.
2.  **ELINT—Electronic Intelligence.**
    Gathering information about all (the enemy's) electronic capabilities, including communications and radars. The antennae and surveillance receivers used operate in the very high and ultra-high frequencies (VHF & UHF), are very sophisticated and determine such characteristics as frequencies and location of communications equipment, and operating patterns, pulse rates, shapes and lengths of radars, and so forth. Since radars are capable of frequently varying these characteristics and do so, ELINT is a good example of a long-term strategic intelligence gathering activity.⁶
3.  **RADAR.**
    Radar is usually thought of as a purely defensive system, but the NADGE (NATO Air Defense Ground Environment) array is much more. NADGE ray domes stretch from eastern Turkey to northern Norway, where their 500 kilometer reach rules out a solely defensive posture. It was learned, for example, that NADGE in Norway regularly watches the scrambling of Soviet fighters from their base at Murmansk during defense exercises. This is direct spying on a defensive activity and the information obtained, such as how fast the fighters are scrambled, etc., is of use only if an intrusion of Soviet air space was being contemplated—F-111's or B-52's against Murmansk, for example. The anxious Norwegian general who spilled the beans about tracking that wayward Korean airliner until it went down well behind Murmansk, a good 300 kilometers from the NADGE station, underscored this capability. And in all likelihood, the infamous Red Flag Squadron⁷ designs its behavior according to NADGE-supplied data.

[Image: NADGE Radar Domes in Northern Norway. Several large, white geodesic domes are visible, typical of radar installations.]
4.  **INTERCEPTION OF TELEMETRY.**
    The interception of Russian missile telemetry—that is, all of the data that is relayed back during a missile launch and flight—is another instance of an intelligence activity that has no direct relevance to Norway's security, since Norway is not primarily threatened by Soviet ICBMs. However, since this information provides a way to measure Russian advances in missile technology and, ultimately, aids the definition of the state of the global arms race, analysts believe it to be somewhat legitimate. They would ask only that this activity, which is directed against the military satellite launching and test site at Plesetsk near Archangel, and the submarine missile-launching test sites in the Barents and White Seas, be acknowledged, as it is in Turkey, where similar stations record data from Russian satellite bases on the other side of the Caspian Sea.
5.  **DETECTION OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS.**
    The detection of nuclear explosions is an instance of an activity and technique that has multiple methods and purposes, and illustrates, along with seismic monitoring (see #8 below), the difficulty involved in exposing the complete and true nature of these activities. And why even well-meaning professional people are often taken in and their scientific expertise and contributions perverted.
    The detection of nuclear explosions by *infrasound* is one of the most reliable methods and is accomplished with an instrument known as a microbarograph, which listens to sound waves of extremely low frequency generated by, among other things, nuclear explosions. The station at Karashok, in the middle of Norwegian Lappland, has as its major function this monitoring to assure Russian compliance with the atmospheric nuclear test ban. Infrasound, as an additional safeguard, can also detect missile launches which might not be announced by the Soviets. This is the admitted role, but infrasound detection has a war-fighting role as well. Infrasound can pinpoint one's own nuclear explosions and detail their nature, that is to say, where and if they are exploding, energy yield in kilo- or megatons, and the type and height of the explosion. This last, the height, would be important in determining those bombs exploding as predetermined and those exploded by (enemy) anti-ballistic missiles. The one disadvantage of this method is the relatively slow speed of infrasound waves.
    The second method of detection employs a sophisticated type of photometer in watching for the flash of light which occurs in the sky at the time of a nuclear explosion. Similar to the Aurora, it is a reaction from the disturbed ionosphere. Like the microbarograph, the photometer system also helps determine the characteristics and types of bombs and can be used as a back-up system to confirm signals from the former. Subsequent analysis of the wave lengths of light from the bombs provides even more refined data, such as whether a lithium-based thermo-nuclear or "regular" dirty uranium bomb, etc., has been detonated.
6.  **SATELLITE TELEMETRY INTERCEPT AND/OR TIME CONTROL.**
    The exact nature of this activity in Norway has not yet been determined, though peace researchers and analysts believe it to be the interception of telemetry from Russian military satellites or ground control for U.S. spy satellites. A large ray dome situated in a valley surrounded by mountains—the typical layout for satellite ground control stations—located at Fauske, is either intercepting telemetry beamed down from Russian military satellites to a ground station at Murmansk, or is a "time control" ground station that tunes the super-sensitive equipment aboard Ferret-series spy satellites monitoring radar and other transmissions from their space orbits. If the latter is so, and there is much evidence for it, then this would tie in directly with electronic intelligence, ELINT (#2 above).
    The site at Fauske lies close to Bodo, where it was intended that Gary Powers would land his U-2 after completing the over-flight of the Soviet Union from Peshawar in Pakistan.
7.  **UNDERWATER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING.**
    Sonar today is so advanced that it can listen to submarines thousands of kilometers away. According to U.S. Congressional testimony, the U.S. Navy's Ocean Surveillance Information System (OSIS) has 21 locations worldwide, that maintain more or less global surveillance of the oceans. A *New York Times Magazine* article revealed one of these to be in Norway. SOSUS (Sonar Surveillance System)—a submarine cable outfitted with hydrophones—allows the monitoring of every submarine that arrives or leaves the Russian submarine base at Murmansk. This cable probably runs from the North Cape in Norway out to the Norwegian island territory of Svalbard that juts towards the North Pole. (*Time* magazine located it at Jan Mayen Isle, also belonging to Norway.)
    This activity has a very obvious defensive purpose, of course, but the unbalancing factor is enormous. With this SOSUS cable, and another, or others, covering the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Islands-United Kingdom gaps—the only channels open to Soviet subs—coupled to the world-spanning OSIS, the U.S. knows, in all probability, the exact location of every Soviet submarine at all times. In contrast, U.S. Navy submarines are not geographically restricted, and have a multitude of bases permitting them to operate unhindered and undetected in practically the whole of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
    The fulcrum of the "balance of terror" is, more than anything else, the missile-carrying submarine fleets of the United States and the Soviet Union. The threat of carnage and megadeath spewing forth from the bowels of the seas, has kept, supposedly, even the most maniacally itchy fingers from the button. With this total surveillance of the oceans (or worse, an erroneous belief that it was total), the tremendous advantage owing to the U.S. removes the balance and the restraint from military planners' and politicos' minds, and contributes to the new thinking amongst them that the United States could win a nuclear war through the pre-emptive first-strike destruction of the entire Soviet retaliatory force.⁸
8.  **SEISMIC MONITORING.**
    Seismic monitoring is the only non-secret activity—all of the other seven are officially secret. Seismic monitoring has very commendable overt functions: the detection of nuclear explosions, primarily underground explosions, and research on detection methods as a major step toward a comprehensive test-ban treaty. No total test-ban treaty on underground explosions exists because it is claimed that it is not possible to accurately police underground testing.⁹ That, in Norway, seismic monitoring is not secret, depends more on the practical realities rather than on some latent wish by the U.S. to atone for all of its legal and moral violations connected with the others. The National Security Agency has set up and manned—that is, personnel from its military counterparts: ASA (Army Security Agency), USAFSS (Air Force Security Service), and NSG (Naval Security Group)—similar secret arrays in Iran, West Germany, Thailand, Australia and Turkey. It was the U.S. Air Force, however, that set up and finances the huge array of seismometers, stretching over more than a hundred kilometers in northern Norway near Gjovik and Hamar, known as NORSAR (Norwegian Seismic Array). NORSAR detects underground nuclear explosions, and by analyzing resulting earthquake signals, determines their depth and energy yield as well as other information. It also does much, much, more. Since there were no U.S. military bases in Norway as in the above mentioned countries, and since the Norwegian military did not have the necessary technical expertise, the U.S. was forced to choose the cover of "pure scientific research" to accomplish its needs. Norwegian civilian seismologists operate the NORSAR system, for the most part, in good faith, believing their research to be an important contribution to the movement for a comprehensive test ban. That the U.S. Air Force picks up the tab for everything appears only logical since it has responsibility for test-ban treaty research and monitoring. In addition, scientists and researchers are left pretty much alone and have a free hand to conduct their own research and scientific projects. The only requirement is that they send back continuous information to the United States. The nature of this information, and where and how it ends up, bears scrutinizing.
    Norway is the only country on the European side of the Atlantic¹⁰ feeding continuous and current strategic data into the world's largest, and all military, computer system located in the United States, known as ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). A very expensive satellite link keeps NORSAR real-time data streaming into the Seismic Data Analysis Center (SDAC) in Alexandria, Virginia. There it is combined and correlated with data from other non-secret and secret global arrays to achieve a more total composite picture, and then made available to the rest of ARPANET users, including the NSA with which it maintains a direct link. This emphasizes that NORSAR is more than just an egalitarian research project. NORSAR intelligence information that exceeds this posture concerns Soviet nuclear technology (bomb size, etc.) and is used in designing countermeasures. And since 10% of the energy of a surface nuclear explosion couples into the ground as seismic waves, NORSAR has a war-fighting role similar to infrasound.

---
⁵ The Omega navigation system illustrates this point well. The U.S. originally claimed that it would be of local benefit in its arguments with Norwegian authorities—for example as an aid to coastal shipping—but the nature of Omega's VLF (very low frequency) propagation makes it unusable within a radius of 600 miles.
⁶ B-52 bombers carry jamming and "spoofing" equipment aboard which puts out fake signals and generates a false image on (enemy) radar screens. Any missiles sent up at this image will explode harmlessly far away from the B-52. The design information for this equipment comes from such electronic intelligence.
⁷ A US AF squadron of MIG fighter look-alikes, replete with Soviet markings. This squadron tours air bases in the U.S. "engaging" U.S. fighter and bomber pilots in mock air battles using Soviet Air Force tactics. These are fighters, not bombers, and their purpose is to simulate the response of Soviet air defenses reacting to an intrusion of their territory. The Soviet Union has lodged official complaints against the Red Flag Squadron.
⁸ This is not a new postulation; see: "U.S. Electronic Espionage: A Memoir," *Ramparts*, August, 1972.
⁹ In fact, there is an abundance of technical literature to substantiate that an almost 100% capability exists for detecting underground nuclear explosions as small as 2-3 kilotons, which is much smaller than anyone would wish to test. Norway's neighbor, Sweden, has done excellent research here and shown the falseness of the contrary position. It has been suggested that in the case of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., the former wants to keep testing to maintain its advantage, and the latter because it is so far behind.
¹⁰ The United Kingdom is also sending data through a NORSAR satellite channel, but at this point it is experimental and concerns packet-switching; that is, the sending of massive amounts of data bits simultaneously.

### Public Mobilization

Though most of the information made public to date has been done so by military people, journalists, politicians and "professional" peace researchers—with the noted exception of individuals like Ivar Johansen—the result has been to spark a growing popular movement. Intent on publicizing Norway's tenuous and precarious middlemanship, and organizing to change that status, radical pacifist groups have begun the first phase of this campaign by plotting and making public the location and nature of all NATO warning installations in Norway and the dangers they pose to the local populaces. They assert that systems such as the ACE HIGH communications network, which runs the full 3000 mile length of the NATO defense chain from eastern Turkey to northern Norway, is a European facade for the same system that in the Far East is strictly a U.S. military operation. ACE HIGH culminates in northern Norway at Bodo (one of its stations is located within 20 miles of the Russian border); here vast amounts of information are concentrated and fed through hundreds of channels to interconnect with purely American communications systems.

A number of journals and newspapers devoted to debating Norway's relationship to NATO and the U.S. are being published,¹¹ and defense strategies for those indicted for national security violations have been planned.

Whether or not Norway remains the spy left out in the cold depends much upon the success or failure of this mobilization.

## The Unanswered Questions of the GLOMAR EXPLORER

**By Fritzi Cohen***

*HUGHES GLOMAR EXPLORER*

One notorious and as yet unresolved CIA mystery pertains to the development and operation of the Hughes Glomar Explorer. Over four years ago, the Military Audit Project (MAP), a small research group in Washington focusing on defense procurement irregularities, brought suit under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain information on the planning, development, financing and ultimate use and disposition of the vessel whose Federal ownership or non-ownership had become a celebrated matter in the press.

Project Jennifer was the CIA's code name for the whole project package. This included building the 25,000 ton capacity Glomar Explorer, outfitted with the latest in exotic electronic gear, a submersible barge bigger than a football field, a gigantic claw-lift nicknamed Clementine, and the leasing of a covership Seascope, which mined for manganese nodules. Among the still secret participants in Project Jennifer, according to the affidavit of Ernest J. Zellmer, Associate Deputy Director of the CIA (Science and Technology), is an agency of the U.S. government whose "mere identity" is too sensitive to disclose.

The secret agency may have been one reason that the respected Judge Gerhart Gesell of the Federal District Court in Washington dismissed MAP's complaint for "reasons that were secret" in October 1976. Upon remand from the Court of Appeals Gesell recused himself from further consideration of the case. The Judge felt compromised, "made fun of by the agency" when the Justice Department/CIA suddenly reversed its position and, under directions from the National Security Council admitted CIA involvement in Project Jennifer. Judge Gesell said he no longer could accept the representation of those witnesses (government) who appeared before him and who "cut their heart out about the secrecy here." (Transcript of proceedings, June 28, 1977.)

The Judge then read into the record a part of his secret opinion that he had locked away eight months before:
> The Court: For instance, I say: "The capabilities of our Government in the area, the methods used to finance and conceal the project and the amounts which the U.S. was willing to commit to the venture are all matters vital to the security of the country."

Why such information is vital to our nation's security and not vital to those who, under penalty of imprisonment, must finance such activities, i.e. taxpayers, has never been explained satisfactorily.

### Some Of What We Know

One of the three companies the CIA has acknowledged as participating, Global Marine, contracted with the U.S. to manage Project Jennifer in 1970. Summa Corporation, formerly Hughes Tool, joined the project in December 1972, perhaps only coincidentally, five weeks after Howard Hughes made an emergency contribution of $100,000 to Nixon's reelection campaign, as reported in the *New York Times*.

To date in the course of litigation the Government has released certain documents involving Summa and Global Marine. Although the documents were liberally sanitized of dollar figures, names and task descriptions (except for certain deep sea mining activities) they do convey a sense of the project's monstrous proportions in both technical and monetary terms. For example, numerous vouchers documenting billings reveal that the U.S. arrangement with Summa and Global Marine was a cost plus a percentage of cost basis, a method of contracting prohibited under Title 10, sec. 230(g) of the U.S. Code. Overhead percentage rates frequently seemed outrageously inflated and overruns numerous to MAP's staff.

The government also filed court affidavits from Stansfield Turner, Brent Scowcroft, Cyrus Vance and two high level CIA officials all of which claimed that additional releases of information would seriously jeopardize the national security. The affidavits on which Judge Gesell made his secret opinion however, remain under seal.

One very curious aspect of the CIA's posture has been the continued stonewalling of questions regarding Lockheed's involvement in Project Jennifer. Curious because Lockheed's participation is a matter of common knowledge. For one thing the company boasted about it in its company newspaper, *Southern Star*, "published for the people of Lockheed Georgia, Co." "Some details of the world's largest submersible—the Hughes Mining Barge (HMB-1) were disclosed by two Lockheed engineers," it was reported on Dec. 1, 1977 "in a technical paper presented in Los Angeles at the Oceans '77 Conference. Larger than a football field, the HMB-1 was designed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. as a submersible transfer vehicle for an ocean floor work system."

The *Southern Star* article was submitted to the Court along with several other official documents identifying Lockheed as a participant, but there has been no sign that it has had any impact on the court's current rationale, which can be best described as a rubber stamp of whatever explanation the government comes up with.

A later submission by MAP, depositions taken in *United States v. County of Los Angeles* (1976), provides further proof of Lockheed's involvement. Interestingly this testimony was taken in the presence of John J. McCarthy, tax division, Justice Department, and David Toy, lawyer for the witnesses. Toy had previously represented himself to county tax authorities as working for the CIA. Neither Toy nor McCarthy objected to the line of questioning of the county's lawyer which would reveal corporate participants.

*Following are excerpts taken from the deposition of Curtis Crooke, Vice-President of Global Marine and President of Global Marine Development Corporation.*

**Larry Launer, representing the Los Angeles County Tax Office:** What party or parties originally conceived the idea to design and construct the Hughes Glomar Explorer?
**A.** Global Marine.
**Q.** What was the intent of Global Marine in designing and constructing the Hughes Glomar Explorer?
**A.** To provide a viable tool that could accomplish the job of the United States Government that they wanted accomplished.
**Q.** Did Global Marine contract with the U.S. Government to design the Hughes Glomar Explorer?
**A.** Yes, sir.
**Q.** When was that contract executed?
**A.** Well it has been a series of contracts and letter agreements starting in what would have been 1970.... The contract was between Global Marine and Mechanics Research, Inc... To my recollection, that contract started out to review and criticize approaches to solving a problem that the federal government had... I do not remember as to when we started into the next phase of it; at which time it then became more definite; something that eventually turned into the design of the Hughes Glomar Explorer.
*[Throughout the deposition McCarthy systematically objected to Launer's questions that tried to elicit descriptions of the "problem," "job," or "mission" on the ground that the answers would be classified.]*
**Q.** Was Global Marine involved in a contract of that nature involving subcomponents and what not?
**A.** Yes.... It would have started in 1970 (corrected to 1971) with people like Minneapolis Honeywell, General Motors, Western Gear, Nordberg Engines, General Electric, Cooper Bessemer, Fag Bearings in Germany. Hughes Tool and the Government were not parties to these contracts.
**Q. Mr. Toy:** Just for the sake of clarification are you talking about a single agreement with all of those parties you mentioned?
**A.** No there must be hundreds of that nature.
**Q. Launer:** The contracts entered into ... were those contracts classified?
**A.** Yes, sir.
**Q.** Now, due to my ignorance, at this stage where we are talking about these contracts in 1971, would it be correct to state that you were still concerned with the design stage of the Hughes Glomar Explorer, or had you moved onto getting the parts for the construction?
**A.** They go hand in hand with each other.
**Q.** Let's look to the construction of the vessel itself. Were there any contracts that Global Marine entered into which called for the construction of the Glomar Explorer?
**A.** Yes, sir. Between Global Marine and Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.
**Q.** When was that contract entered into?
**A.** April, 1971.
**Q.** ... When did construction commence on the vessel itself?
**A.** In April of '71.
*[After a bit of confusion as to the actual launching date it was finally agreed that the Glomar was ready to set sail by Nov. 1972.]*
**Q.** Now are you familiar, sir, with the barge that I have been told is used in connection with the operations of the Hughes Glomar Explorer?
**A.** Yes.
**Q.** Is that barge referred to as the HMB-1?
**A.** Yes....
**Q.** Was Global Marine involved in any contract with any party which contract called for the design and construction of that barge?
**A.** Not other than our overall role of Systems Engineering Technical Direction.
**Q.** I am concerned, sir, with the contract or contracts wherein Global Marine was a party, which contracts dealt with the design and construction of the HMB-1. Can you tell me which contract or contracts were involved with the barge?
**A.** ... Some things we were directly responsible for and others, the suppliers had direct contracts with the United States Government, as far as I know. And we had an overall monitoring responsibility in terms of engineering capability, cost, and schedule.
**Q.** ... You were also, at that time, [time of original contract, Jan. 1970] concerned ... with the design and construction of the barge?
**A.** In the 1970 contract we were concerned with an overall system that would do a particular job for the United States Government.... It evolved into including the barge.
**Q.** Who handled the construction responsibilities for the barge?
**A.** Lockheed Missiles and Space division; something like that.
**Q.** All right. If they had the construction responsibility for the barge, did Global Marine have a part or all of the responsibility for the design of the barge?
**A.** For monitoring and approving the design; yes. Detailing and day-to-day engineering, no.... The barge in this program has served two functions. It has been a construction and assembly facility for certain pieces of underwater equipment, which equipment eventually has to be wound up; which is both too heavy and too large to put in over the deck or with a crane. Therefore, it is placed into the ship by submerging the HMB to the ocean floor, driving the HGE over the top of it, opening up the well gates, lowering the docking lines down into the HMB and retrieving that all back up into the center well of the HGE.
**Q.** And has it so functioned only during operations concerning the secret government mission?
**A.** Yes sir; to the best of my knowledge.
**Q.** Where is the barge now?
**A.** As far as I know, tied up at Redwood City or tied up in Pier E in Long Beach.
**Q.** [Re the contract of Dec. 5, 1972] "The contractor agrees to maintain books, records, documents, and other evidence pertaining to the cost, et cetera of the contract."... Do you know where those records are presently maintained?
**A.** I would imagine they're maintained in their entirety and complete form in the program office.
**Q.** Where is that program office located?
**A.** [to government attorney] Is that classified?
**Mr. McCarthy:** Program office, that would be classified information.
**Witness:** That was my opinion.
**Mr. McCarthy:** It's an interface facility between the U.S. Government and the contractor.
**Q. By Mr. Launer:** Sir, do you know who has custody of the books, records and documents which are called for ... which related to cost incurred by Global Marine?
**A.** In essence, the government contract, as far as I know, records and documents generated are basically the property of the federal government. Certainly those records are here in this building. Other records exist in the program office.
**Q.** Now, I would like to ask you a hypothetical question, if I could. Assume that a knowledgeable person with experience in exploration for oil and mineral deposits on the ocean floor were to go and inspect the Hughes Glomar Explorer. Do you know if that knowledgeable person could be led to believe that that vessel was not designed or equipped for exploration for oil or mineral deposits?
**A.** First, start off with oil. Anyone who has knowledge in the offshore drilling oil business would look at that piece of equipment and say that certain portions of it would certainly be nice. But obviously it is not made or does it accomplish any job. In offshore drilling you have your generators, living quarters, many dynamic things. And here it lacks so much that a knowledgeable person would not look at it and say, "Gee, here's an oil rig."
**Q.** How about exploration for mineral deposits?
**A.** That again, in my opinion, becomes an interesting question. Quite obviously when one is looking for a cover, if the government interest is behind you, immediately you pick up the idea of offshore mining because there is no expert on what an offshore mining rig looks like. I dare say I can take anybody and I can convince them either way, because there's no background; nothing established.
**Q.** Sir, if you had no involvement with the Hughes Glomar Explorer and you went on that vessel in the latter part of 1973 or early 1974, do you think you would have concluded that that vessel was not designed and/or equipped for the exploration on the ocean floor of oil or mineral deposits?
**A.** Oil deposits, you would conclude it was not designed for that. Mineral deposits, I would say you could convince anybody. For years, people were convinced it was. It had been photographed. You asked me for my opinion. It has obviously been photographed. It had been looked at. It had been walked on. It had been sailed around in, and there is no way for somebody to tell at that stage in the development of the industry whether that was designed for mining or not.

*Following is Mr. McCarthy's examination of the witness:*
**Q.** I believe, you stated earlier that the HGE did not extract any mineral deposits from the ocean floor; is that correct?
**A.** Yes.
**Q.** Now, in this program, did your company at any time collect any nodules from the ocean floor?
**A.** Yes.
**Q.** Can you explain when and how that was done?
**A.** That would be—must have been during the summer, fall of '71.... We chartered the vessel SEASCOPE in Santa Barbara from Kenny Elmes and outfitted it for cover purposes, to go out and survey and look for legitimate-looking nodule deposits to have the ship at sea sail through areas and have radio communication and establish the fact that the Summa Corporation was interested in the offshore mining business.
**Q.** Do you recall approximately how many nodules were collected?
**A.** 35,000 to 40,000 pounds.
**Q.** Do you know how much the nodules are worth per ton, approximately?
**A.** $20 or $30 a ton. I guess the price has fluctuated by now.
**Q.** I believe you stated that your company created the concept of the HGE?
**A.** Yes, sir.
**Q.** And presented it to the government, and the government accepted your concept?
**A.** That's correct.
**Q.** When did you present that concept to the government, approximately?
**A.** In about November—October or November of 1970.
**Q.** After you had conceived the concept of the HGE, presented it to the government, and the government had approved your concept?
**A.** Yes, sir. It was also after having tried to generate the mining as a cover.
**Q.** Did Summa Corporation join the project after you had?
**A.** After that work had been done.
**Q.** Do you know what happened to those nodules that were collected?
**A.** Some of them went into some research lab. The government has custody of the rest of them, as far as I know; outside of some momentos, as far as I know, none of them were released to any of the contractors.
**Q.** In building the pipestring, what role did the Summa Corporation or the Hughes Tool Company play?
**A.** Basically, the pipestring, the design of the pipestring again, was started before Hughes Tool Company got into the contract. Other pipe manufacturers had been contacted about the matter.
**Q.** By whom?
**A.** By Global Marine; when obviously Summa agreed to take over for the government in this contract. Again it would make no sense to the general public for Hughes Tool Company to be building pipe and having it fabricated by somebody else. Their prime business is manufacturing tool joints. And so that contract was laid off economically and it was the responsibility of the Hughes Tool Company to place the subcontracts for the manufacture of that piece; again under Global Marine.

*Mr. Launer's examination resumed:*
**Q.** What was the precise purpose for which Global Marine chartered the SEASCOPE to do this operation?
**A.** To exactly go out and survey, for bathymetric surveys, and to dredge up manganese nodules.
**Q.** Why was GM interested in nodules?
**A.** Global Marine obviously was not interested in nodules because GM never had their hands on the nodules. Global Marine was interested in establishing a posture in the field. Summa was interested in the nodules.
**Q.** What, if you know, were the hopes of either the U.S. Government or Global Marine when they embarked upon this operation with the SEASCOPE to remove the nodules?
**A.** To convince the general public that the project was truly a deep sea mining project.
**Q.** So what additional gain would be made by chartering the SEASCOPE and having that go out and removing nodules from the floor, as related to the general public?
**A.** Well, you don't go out and build yourself a great big iron-ore smelter unless you have gotten out and done yourself a certain amount of scoring and pitting and looking to see if you have a good deposit to mine. As to the Summa Corporation spending money in developing a deep sea mining vessel, they have not gotten their feet wet; they don't know what the bottom conditions are. How do you build a system if you don't make an attempt to get basic data?
**Q.** When did you become aware of the secret government mission involved with the HGE?
**A.** I first became aware of a secret government mission in November of 1969.
**Q.** And who told you, sir?
**A.** United States Government.
**Q.** Who from the United States Government?
**Mr. McCarthy:** That's classified, and I instruct the witness not to answer.
**Mr. Launer:** Okay. Nothing further.

### What We'd Like to Know

Curtis Crooke's testimony raises many provocative questions. Let me mention just two.

The first: What about Roy Ash's role, unknown to date, in Project Jennifer? Ash was in a unique position to serve his own interest as a director of Global Marine and to influence the U.S. executive branch. Global Marine received $35.5 million for its work on the Glomar, retaining almost 30% of that amount or $10.8 million as before-tax operating profit. Ash headed President Nixon's Advisory Counsel on Executive reorganization in 1969 and in 1970, the year of the first contracts between the U.S. and Global Marine. In 1972, Ash became head of Office of Management and Budget, the office through which all U.S. financial transactions pass—including those that are top-secret. Ash currently, in addition to presiding over Addressograph Inc., is also a director of Systems Development Corporation, the successor to Mechansi Research Inc., identified early in Crooke's testimony as a major participant in the formation stage of Project Jennifer.

Second: Is the Soviet sub story only a cover for the Glomar's real mission? Planning, designing and building a sizable seagoing vessel is complex and the four year period between the sinking of the Soviet sub (1968) and the Explorer's launching (1972) seems unrealistically short to those familiar with the nature of shipbuilding. Thus there is the logical suspicion that, whoever conceptualized Project Jennifer, planning and design work at least was probably begun well before 1968.

What is the real story behind Project Jennifer? Was it a billion dollar boondoggle—a floating Spruce Goose, or as suggested by Tom Wicker (*New York Times*, 1975) "a clandestine enterprise at a time of international dispute on the law of the sea that could potentially give the U.S. or participating contractors an enormous, if not exactly proper advantage in undersea mining techniques."

We'd like the answers to these questions and more. And we resent being bludgeoned into believing that security for the intelligence apparatus is synonymous with the real security of our nation. Our immediate struggle however is to survive the Government's attempt to abort any further inquiry. If the CIA has its way and is exempted from the Freedom of Information Act, this lawsuit, *MAP v. Turner*, may be the last shot for a long time at a corporate profile of the intelligence bureaucracy.

## MIND CONTROL: The Story of Mankind Research Unlimited, Inc.

**By A.J. Weberman***

Various branches of the United States government—certainly the U.S. Navy and probably the Central Intelligence Agency—are spending millions of dollars to finance an obscure District of Columbia corporation called Mankind Research Unlimited, Inc. (MRU). The personnel of this bizarre company and its affiliates and subsidiaries include some of the most frightening scientists the government has at its disposal. Its goal—despite the multisyllabic jargon of its brochures—is mind control.

I first learned of MRU in 1972 from a young friend who knew Dr. Stanley Krippner, Chief Researcher at the "Dream Laboratory" of Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, and Vice-President of the Soviet-American Association for Psychotronic Research. Dr. Krippner told my friend that he had returned from the Soviet Union with a schematic drawing for a "Kirlian Device" given to him by a colleague there. A "Kirlian Device" reportedly photographs "electrochemiluminescence," an as yet undefined energy field which surrounds living matter—sometimes referred to as the "human aura." According to Krippner, "The U.S. government had information on Kirlian photography in 1959, ... but released it only to the CIA, Rand, the Air Force, etc. It wasn't until ... I went to the U.S.S.R. and brought back the blueprints personally that this information was made available to the general public."

Krippner gave a copy of the schematic to my friend, who then assembled such a camera and began some experiments with it. Shortly thereafter, he stopped by my office to tell me that he had been contacted by a very strange outfit. "They call themselves Mankind Research Unlimited. Whoever they are they want my schematic and they want it bad."

The man who wanted the schematic was Paul Sauvin, who, we later learned, was MRU's expert "specializing in the detection and analysis of 'life energy' emissions," in the words of MRU's brochure. Sauvin was an electromechanical engineer and inventor who had worked in the aerospace industry for thirteen years before moving to the National Institute for Rehabilitation Engineering at St. Joseph's Hospital, Patterson, New Jersey. Sauvin was investigating the possibility of a "Bionic Man" long before the TV show was around. According to the MRU materials his research "has also included investigations of the High Frequency 'Kirlian Effect' photography, thought-controlled devices, and psycho-kinetic switches." Although the MRU brochure indicates that this research is directed towards the development of prosthetic devices for the severly disabled, the military's interest in a trigger which could be actuated by thinking the command to fire is obvious.

My friend and I agreed that he should find out more about MRU. He met with Sauvin, indicated his interest, and hinted at his willingness to part with the Kirlian schematic, but asked if he could visit MRU's headquarters in Washington. Sauvin agreed, and in early 1973 my friend drove to Washington and went late in the afternoon to see MRU Director Carl Schleicher. Without much difficulty my friend succeeded in spending some time alone in the offices, during which he "inspected" the available files and made off with a number of documents, all of which he subsequently showed me. They tell a frightening story of government efforts to develop expertise in the art of psychic warfare.

MRU's "Brochure" begins with an explanation of the company's background. It is a District of Columbia corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Systems Consultants, Inc. (SCI). SCI, according to its Brochure, was founded in 1966 and has participated in programs concerned with "aircraft systems, ship and craft armament systems and analysis and integration of airborne and shipboard data processing systems. In short, Systems Consultants, Inc. has had extensive experience in planning, organizing and evaluating a variety of governmental projects.... A permanent, professional staff of 250 has concentrated on problem solving in the areas of intelligence electronic warfare, sensor technology and applications."

SCI had offices in Washington, with branch offices in McLean, Falls Church, and Arlington, Virginia—the sites, co-incidentally enough, of the CIA and the Pentagon. MRU's Carl Schleicher worked for SCI as late as 1972. According to documents obtained by my resourceful friend, Schleicher was cleared to receive and to hold—and did so—classified Navy publications with such titles as "Ship Exercises," "Anti-Air Warfare," and "Air and AAW Exercises." SCI received most of its funding from the United States Navy—although it is quite possible that much of this was CIA funds, laundered through the Navy. (This has been done before; at least a half million dollars of "Navy Research funds" were used, according to *Sea Technology* magazine, in the Glomar Explorer venture—in fact the CIA's attempt to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. [See the article on the Glomar project in this issue of CAIB.] A *New York* magazine article by William K. Stucky, "Psychic Power: The Next Superweapon," reported that funding for the Stanford Research Institute's psychic warfare think tank comes from the Navy Electronics Systems Command.) SCI's "sales" grew from $250,000 in 1967 to $6,500,000 in 1971.

A few years ago I visited SCI's Georgetown office and inquired about a position as a computer-programmer. The Security Director, Eugene D. Pasztor, took me into his office, locked the door, and asked me how I had become aware of SCI. I had a copy of a page from "Who's Who in Systems Consulting" with a reference to SCI, which I showed to Pasztor. He checked my copy with an original in his files, and, finding the two to be identical, gave me a copy of the SCI brochure and his card. Then he unlocked the door and let me out.

MRU is less overtly militaristic than its parent SCI, but equally, if not more bizarre.

MRU's brochure summarizes the "Philosophy and Purpose" of the organization, which rests on the assumption "That the biological effects of environment can be modified by the action of energies, or biological force fields, either to enhance or threaten mankind's well-being.... The U.S.S.R. has more than twenty centers for the study of biocommunications (the Soviet term for parapsychology) and related phenomena, with an annual budget estimated to be over 12 million rubles ($13 million) for 1967 and as high as $21 million for 1970.... These figures are not matched in the United States, where only insignificant sums have been spent for this kind of research. This indicates that the U.S.S.R. is more aware of the benefits and applications of biocommunication research. Mankind Research hopes to counter and reverse this trend so that the full fruits and benefits derived from this research are also made available to the United States."

The brochure goes on to reveal that MRU's "capability and experience" is divided into four fields. The first is "biophysics," which includes "Biological Effects of Magnetic Fields;" "Research in Magneto-fluid Dynamics" (the effects of low level magnetic fields on water and the subsequent effects on living organisms that ingest the water); "Planetary Electro-Hydro-Dynamics" (efforts to change the nature of the magnetic field present in large bodies of water); and "Geo-pathic Efforts on Living Organisms" (attempts to induce illness by changing the magnetic nature of the geography).

MRU's second field of interest may be geared to produce a device that emits waves which cause mental confusion. Termed "Biocybernetics," this area encompasses "Reactions to Stress" and "Psychodynamic Experiments in Telepathy," as well as "Errors in Human Perception," "Bio-Feedback" and "Biologically Generated Fields."

MRU's third field of interest is "Behavioral Science." This includes "Metapsychiatry and the Ultraconscious Mind" (telepathic mind control); "Behavioral Neuropsychiatry," "Analysis and Measurement of Human Subjective States" (computer analyzed EEG's, biofeedback, etc.), and "Human Unconscious Behavioral Patterns."

[Image: A stylized drawing depicting a human head with a clock-like mechanism inside, a hand adjusting a dial on the mechanism. Another figure is observing this, suggesting control or manipulation of the mind.]
*ILLUSTRATION BY JAY MUDCR*

Finally MRU's fourth field of interest is "Psychophysics." This includes "Bioluminescent Applications," (MRU claims to be "the first organization to obtain a government grant to explore the use of Kirlian photography as a diagnostic technique"); "Radiesthesia Research in the Soviet Union" (wave-induced anesthesia); "Dowsing Introduced to the US Armed Forces;" "Dowsing as a Tunnel Detection Device;" and "Correlation of Magnetic Field Gradients with Dowsing Reaction Zones."

MRU's facilities are located in seven states; in Mountain View, Los Altos, California, MRU scientists studying Advanced Sensor Technology have tested psycho-accoustical transmitters that produce sound-patterns termed "infra and ultrasonic" that interact with brain cells and "wipe them clean" of all information. In Miami, Florida, MRU scientists are hard at work studying the physiological and biological effects of magnetic fields. In Washington, D.C., MRU psychologists study "Psycho-technology Research and Biocybernetics"—brain control through subcutaneous electronic devices—and "Biochemical and Physio-Chemical Research"—brain control through pharmacological substances.

MRU lists in its Company Capabilities "brain and mind control" and admits "acquiring on a daily basis, a large amount of unique bio-cybernetics data from Eastern Europe. Some of this original data has been translated and to our knowledge these reports have not been previously made available within the United States."

The most interesting part of the Mankind brochure is the "Selected Resumes of Personnel." The Research and Development Director of Mankind Research is Carl Schleicher. Schleicher studied electrical engineering at the United States Naval Academy. He received his M.A. from the University of Cologne and did graduate work at the University of Bonn (Germany). While at SCI, Schleicher designed "state-of-the-art technological forecasting and assessment systems for the evaluation and selection of multi-million dollar Research and Development projects. Some of the methods used in this system included interacting exploratory and normative forecasting sub-routines, decision tables and optimization algorithms." Schleicher used his unique abilities to develop special software systems "to record, evaluate and document biological effects of special environmental factors on plants, animals and humans."

His partner in mental mayhem is Christopher Bird, described in MRU literature as having "worked for a classified government agency," and, who is in fact, a former CIA employee (see the *Baltimore News-American*, January 31, 1975).

During his youth, Bird lived with a family of White Russian emigres and learned to speak fluent Russian. He studied Chinese for three years at Harvard and Yale and has a working knowledge of French, Spanish, German and Serbo-Croatian. After graduation Bird worked for the CIA in Japan. He served in the U.S. Army, specializing in psychological warfare and prepared a course of study in that subject for the Divisional Staff of the South Vietnamese Army. After his military service Bird became the Washington representative of the Rand Development Corporation. Rand Development, like the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, Inc., was one of the spiritual precursors of outfits like MRU. It was headed by Dr. H.J. Rand, son of the founder of Sperry-Rand, the giant munitions manufacturer. Sperry-Rand provided initial funding for the Rand Corporation—the right-wing think tank with many intelligence connections. Rand Development's Vice-President was George H. Bookbinder, a former OSS officer. Rand Development's CIA ties were made public as the result of an Interior Department expense inquiry reported in the *New York Times*; SIHE's links with the CIA were mentioned in a report in the *Daily World*, September 6, 1975.

Rand Development was one of the first "private corporations" to undertake negotiations with the Soviet Union for the exchange and purchase of technological information. During this period Bird attended the Pugwash meeting on Atomic, Chemical and Biological Warfare as an assistant to the late Cyrus Eaton. Bird went on to work for *Time* magazine as a "correspondent" in Yugoslavia. In 1967 he received a Ph.D. in Russian Area Studies from American University. Bird has lectured on the evils of Communism to members of John Hopkins University's School for Advanced International Studies.

In 1972 Bird co-authored the book "The Secret Life of Plants" (Harper & Row, 1973), along with Peter Tompkins, an ex-OSS Agent. Bird and Tompkins discuss the work of Clive Backster, a lie detector technician who attached a galvanometer to a leaf and noted changes in resistance that allegedly correlated with his thoughts. Backster's work was published in the *Reader's Digest* and he appeared on Long John Nebel's radio show on numerous occasions. Backster and his potted geraniums appeared on national television and caused a minor sensation. Hundreds of thousands of Americans began talking to their plants, yet no practical use ever evolved from Backster's experiments. Researchers at Cornell University veterinary college were unable to duplicate "the Backster Effect." Paul Sauvin, on the other hand, had great success. Sauvin, who was working for ITT at the time, found that his plants reacted to a self-administered electric shock, etc. Bird describes Sauvin, who is "ordained" as a minister of the Psychic Science Temple of Metaphysics, as "a strong pacifist, abhorrent of the use of thought controlled weapons... though he has taken out business certificates on such devices—which put him on record as the owner."

Although the "Backster Effect" was "discovered" in the mid-1960's, in 1972 MRU did not show much of an interest in it, and the possibility exists that the "Backster Effect" and "Secret Life of Plants" were part of a CIA-disinformation campaign. Only the Soviets know how many rubles were spent investigating this "phenomenon."

Bird is listed as the "Biocommunications Editor/Russian Translator" of "Mankind Research." Bird's work has been published by the Rand Corporation and in 1958 he was granted an interview with Ngo Dinh Diem, then "President" of South Vietnam.

Chris Bird is not the only member of MRU dedicated to destroying the Soviet Union. Stefan T. Possony, America's most ubiquitous Russian exile, is also a member of MRU. Possony left Russia after the 1917 Revolution, was exiled in France, and served as an advisor to the French Air Ministry prior to and during the early stages of World War II. After this OSS assignment, he came to the United States and held a post as a Carnegie Research Fellow at the OSS-linked Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey.

During World War II, Possony was a psychological warfare specialist at the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Beginning in 1946, he served as a Special Advisor to the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, USAF, while serving as a Professor of International Politics, Georgetown University. In 1956 Possony became Director of Research for *Life* magazine's "Russian Revolution" project. In 1961 he became Director of the International Studies Program at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, where he is now a Senior Fellow.

Founded in 1919 by Herbert Hoover to "demonstrate the evils of Marxism," the Institution houses the files of the Czarist secret police and the personal diary of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. Hoover's Senior Fellows include Aleksander Solzhenitsyn and Dimitri DeMohrenschildt, the brother of George DeMohrenschildt, Lee Harvey Oswald's closest friend in Dallas, Texas. Coincidentally, Possony is a subscriber to the "lone assassin" theory of the Kennedy assassination and has written several articles to this effect. He is also the author of dozens of books, many of which have been translated into German. The titles include—"Tomorrow's War—It's Planning Management and Costs," "The Economy of Total War," and "Strategy for American Victory."

Possony is on the Board of Directors of many CIA "front" groups, including the American Security Council. Other Council members include a former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, a former Commander of the Strategic Air Command, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former Chief of Counter-intelligence for the CIA, and Dr. Laszlo Pasztor (a Nazi collaborator appointed to a high post in the Republican Party by the Nixon Administration) and Major General John K. Singlaub. Possony is also a member of the American Chilean Council, which is registered as a foreign representative of the fascist Chilean Junta.

MRU member Skaidvite Maliks Fallah was, according to the MRU brochure, "raised and educated in the Baltic state of Latvia prior to the Soviet take-over in 1945." Prior to the end of WWII, in fact, Latvia was, for a time, a Nazi puppet state. In 1962 Mrs. Fallah received her MA in International Relations (Latin American Area Studies) from Johns Hopkins University. After traveling to Venezuela and Peru, she worked as a Senior Research Associate in the Cultural Information Analysis Center (CINFAC). CINFAC is a division of the Center for Research in Social Systems (CRESS) which at the time was under contract to the U.S. Army Research Office. CRESS is a well-known CIA front. Mrs. Fallah's selected bibliography includes "A Selected Bibliography on Urban Insurgency and Urban Unrest in Latin America and Other Areas," and "Training of Military Advisors—An Annotated Bibliography."

George Schepak, MRU's Russian Technical Translator/Biocybernetics Researcher was born and educated in Russia. He also studied in Germany. Schepak designed computers for several space programs, holds a Defense Contractor security clearance and is an expert in "geomagnetism."

Several MRU scientists are very concerned about the Soviet's utilization of electromagnetism. Paul E.T. Jensen managed the Air Defense Task Force of the Army's "Electronic Warfare 1975" study and also the "Electromagnetic Threat to the Army-1985." Jensen is a physicist, mathematician and engineer who specializes in intelligence research and analysis. In 1959 Jensen became "a company" representative at the U.S. Army Electronic Proving Ground, Fort Huachuca, Arizona. This base also happens to be the home of U.S. Army Military Intelligence. In 1960 Jensen became manager of research development at the Electronic Proving Ground and began studying "Eurasian Communist Research and Technology programs." He has been especially interested in new communication techniques such as telepathy, combat surveillance systems, and long range technological forecasts relating to these programs. The results of his studies appear in classified publications.

Working with Jensen is Richard B. LaTondre. LaTondre is currently employed as project engineer for "The Enemy Electromagnetic Threat" (CD-107-EW), a study being conducted for the CIA. LaTondre is primarily responsible for the planning and implementation of the electronic warfare effectiveness analysis effort as related to the update and publication of the "Enemy Electromagnetic Threat—1975." LaTondre also participated in "The Enemy Electromagnetic Threat to Friendly Tactical Aircraft in South Vietnam."

LaTondre studied at the U.S. Army Language School and at the National Security Agency. He served as an Electronics Warfare Officer and has received extensive formal training in combat intelligence, guerrilla warfare, photo-imagery, hydrography and analytical analysis.

[Image: A drawing of several stylized "bug-eyed" figures or probes on stalks, suggesting surveillance or advanced technology.]

Dr. Charles R. Buffler is another MRU magnetologist with fifteen years of research behind him. Dr. Buffler's latest work is on the effect of weak or near zero magnetic fields on humans. Buffler is attempting to formulate a biomagnetic explanation for dowsing and psychokinesis.

Buffler's mentor, Dr. Jim Carstow, is also employed by MRU. Dr. Carstow studied in pre-communist Romania. In 1949 Carstow came to the United States and in 1955 he joined the aerospace industry. In 1959 he began conducting experiments in magneto-fluid dynamics which probed the mysteries of shock-wave propagation in the presence of a magnetic field and radio and magnetohydrodynamic wave interaction. In 1961 Carstow conducted research on the earth's interior and its magnetism, the electrodynamic properties of sea water (with possible application to communication between and detection of submerged submarines). Further research has included the study of the biological effects (in terms of health status, accident rates, behavior patterns, etc.) on humans of variations of electromagnetic, magnetic and gravitational fields.

Several prominent physicians and psychologists are members of MRU. Dr. James C. Aller graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1942. From 1942-1962 Aller served as a Naval Officer. In this capacity he served as a Fleet Electronic Warfare Officer and Missile Range Detector. In 1968 Aller began teaching Biomedical Engineering at the Naval War College.

The distinguished surgeon, E. Stanton Maxey is also a member of MRU. Maxey has conducted extensive studies in sleep research and human unconscious behavior patterns. Through the use of sophisticated sensors, he is attempting to determine the effects of external phenomena on dreams. An innovative feature of this research is the use of electromagnetic recording of EEGs, ultraviolet and infra-red sensors, precise weight analysis and the correlation of these technical factors with electromagnetic field, moon and planetary positions, barometric changes, etc.

The MRU psychiatric and psychological team includes Stanley R. Dean, originator of the theory of the "Ultra-conscious;" Norman Korobow, who conducted research on military leadership at the United States Marine Academy at West Point. This work involved the analysis of identifiable personality variables associated with graded leadership behavior. Korobow is the author of several research papers for the Bureau of Naval Weapons, all of which have been classified "Secret." Another MRU psychologist, Arthur Marcus, is simultaneously involved in two major military electronic system efforts—the SHORT STOP system and the AIR Combat Maneuvering Range System. Marcus had provided support to numerous other military System Program Offices and currently holds a "SECRET" clearance.

Berthold Eric Schwarz, M.D. is also a member of MRU. Schwarz is the author of "You Can Raise Decent Children," published by the conservative publisher—Arlington House. A former member of the "perversion project" at the Mayo clinic, Schwarz is an expert on the effects of LSD on hypnotically-induced seizures.

Other assorted MRU scientists include John E. Laurance, who co-ordinated the support of basic research programs for the Office of Naval Research, in Washington, D.C. In 1969 Mr. Laurance became Vice-President and General Manager of a new corporation established to provide new technologies to developing countries. Laurance has had an interest in the paranormal since the 1930's. In 1969 Laurance established "Life Energies Research, Inc.," a non-profit organization which conducts scientific investigations of unusual and little known properties of human energy systems.

Mankind Research has a Czech defector working for them named Milan Ryzl who was a pioneer in the application of scientific method to the study of parapsychology.

My friend was able to liberate two "Technical Papers" from MRU. The first, dated 31 March 1972, is entitled "Measuring, Selecting and Training For Unique/Special Performance Capability Requirements." "This new approach is well adapted to the selection of applicants seeking to become... covert or clandestine agents ... as well as chief negotiators and policy-makers involved in sensitive problems, both foreign and domestic." The paper is prepared for an un-named government agency, probably the CIA.

[Image: A drawing depicting a figure in a lab coat aiming a device (possibly a camera or sensor) at another figure strapped to a chair with electrodes on their head, suggesting mind control or interrogation experiments.]

MRU proposes that recent psychotechnological devices and techniques can be used in optimizing selection of personnel for employment requiring high and sustained degrees of perception, such as scouts or combat and reconnaissance patrols for the detection of snipers and concealed weapons or booby-traps and explosive devices, clandestine (covert) agents and intelligence operatives.

MRU proposes several techniques to measure the potentials of individuals. One technique involved the computer analysis of psychophysical recordings including data obtained from EKG, EEG, GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) and the plethysmograph which is used to measure vasco-constrictions (blood volume changes) in the finger capillary cells. MRU would supplement the known methods with a recently developed apparatus for measuring electric field radiations from living bodies. (System Research Laboratories of Dayton, Ohio, patent #3,555,529 12 Jan 71.)

MRU's pioneering studies of computer-analyzed EEG's may have led to the formation of CIA sponsored "Brain Research Laboratories" at the San Diego Hospital and at Columbia, Stanford, and New York Universities. These Brain Research Centers are developing the science of Neurometries, the goals of which are to extract and quantify brain functions. Almost half a century ago, it was reported that slow electrical waves could be recorded from the human scalp. Neurometries has brought EEG to a new degree of sophistication by using computers to remove artifacts (60 cycle hum, eye and body movements, etc.) and to compute the waveshape of an average evoked response (AER) to a particular stimulus.

In San Diego the brain waves of volunteers are being analyzed by computers as the subjects look at photographs and are presented with true or false questions. According to *The San Diego Union*, the computer attempts to determine if the volunteer recognizes a specific photograph or is thinking "true" or "false." Researchers claim they can determine when a volunteer recognizes another face, simply by analyzing that volunteer's brainwaves. At Stanford, scientists are attempting to reverse this process and are attempting to transmit thoughts and instruction by playing back previously recorded brain waves.

CIA confirms these experiments are in progress under an Agency contract; however, they claim the human brain and eye are being studied by computers so the CIA can understand how photographic processes work.

As far as improving human performance and capabilities, MRU first suggests autogenic training such as biofeedback. Secondly, they recommend "Biocybernetic Technique." According to MRU "this technique is based on Eastern European research" and involves the direct transmission of information to individual nerve cells. The paper goes on to reveal, "In Eastern Europe, emphasis has been placed on shifting these human sensor limits to the highest possible level through special training programs. Details of these programs are available to MRU and will be applied to the task of improving human performance by biocybernetic means. It is noted that the goal of this effort closely parallels that of a recently issued directive from a U.S. government Agency which has the objective of exploring and developing means by which information of modest rate can be fed to humans utilizing other senses than sight or hearing and which do not disturb but may possibly reinforce the effectiveness of sight or hearing (copy of this directive provided upon request)."

The second MRU technical paper concerns the possible application of the Kirlian technique to the "identification of surface, near sub-surface or concealed objects." Not only was MRU considering the possibility of subjecting all carry-on luggage to electrophotography, MRU scientists were discussing the possibility of taking a Kirlian photograph of every passenger that boarded a U.S. air carrier, then subjecting it to computer analysis; if the computer did not like someone's aura, they would be detained and questioned further. This idea had to be abandoned since the public would never submit to a mild electric shock.

The technical paper is of interest in that it reveals MRU has spies in the U.S.S.R. "MRU has received, during the past year, various unpublished Soviet papers confirming that Russian research in these areas proceeds ahead."

MRU is a strictly capitalist organization and markets a variety of products. MRU actually maintains a retail outlet in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. The products sold here include magnetic plumbing nipples. Initially designed to reduce and prevent the formation of scale in pipes, these French devices play a part in MRU's research into hydro-magnetics. MRU also markets full spectrum fluorescent lighting. This probably relates to MRU's interest in chromotherapy and the effect of ultra-violet light on living organisms. (Chromotherapy is the curing of illness by confining the patient to a room which is painted in only one color. MRU has received a grant from a prestigious scientific institute to conduct this research.)

For $350.00 MRU will sell you a "King's Life Energy Sensor," complete with gold electrodes; to measure biological responses of plants. Packed with each unit is an "Annotated Bibliography" by Skaidrite Fallah.

Another MRU "frontiers of science" product is a $150.00 Kirlian device. MRU also sells Kirlian power supplies for $39.00 and $69.00. For an additional $18.00 you can get "Aura goggles" that use "Dr. Kilner's own dicyanin coal-tar dye for filters."

For $20.00 MRU will send you a computer-generated biorhythm chart.

MRU's motivation for marketing the aforementioned devices is best summed up in their brochure for a "Crooks tube" which they term a "Psychokinetic Radiometer"—"MRU desires to receive results of these experiments."

Several courses, open to the public are sponsored by MRU. "Alpha-Theta Meditation" is a ten week course which includes use of a Galvanic Skin Response Machine and Biofeedback training via EEG analysis. The idea is to produce numerous alpha level brainwaves which characterize deep tranquility. Currently, MRU is trying to develop another biofeedback channel based on the Burr-Ravitz electrodynamic theory of matter. This device would provide feedback through voltage potential gradients measured between two points on the body.

Courses are also offered in the Losznov Learning Method of Suggestology. Dr. George Losznov is a Bulgarian psychiatrist who has developed a system of accelerated learning, utilizing mental relaxation, a special type of psychodrama that provides the student with a freeing-stimulating role, as well as other art forms such as special background music of Mozart, Bach and other classics. As a result, information allegedly bypasses emotional blockage while going directly into the long-term memory area of the brain.

MRU runs several auxiliary organizations including the Society for the Application of Free Energy (S.A.F.E.) which investigates dowsing, which they term "radiesthesia—the investigation of human sensitivity to the vibratory effects created by living organisms as well as those effects inherent in inanimate objects."

The Center for Preventive Therapy and Rehabilitation (CEPTAR) is run by MRU to serve as a liaison group with the medical profession. Finally MRU runs the Mankind Research Foundation—an independent, non-profit, tax exempt organization chartered in the District of Columbia for charitable, educational and scientific purposes. MRF activities are made available to the public through Mankind Research Centers and it is listed as a tax-deductible charity organization with such noble goals as "evaluation of cancer treatment," "use of Kirlian Photography as a diagnostic technique," etc.

[Image: A drawing of a human head with phrenology-like sections marked with numbers.]

Mankind Research continues to operate despite the recent disclosures of CIA Mind Control Programs. MRU vehemently denies any connection with the CIA. In a memorandum for The Record, Carl Schleicher writes—"It has recently come to my attention that various rumors concerning MRU have surfaced ... we are not a front organization for any branch of the United States government... we have never sold data, of any type, to the United States Government... we have, however, obtained several modest government research contracts to make feasibility studies in certain human engineering and psychosomatic evaluative areas ... all of our research and resources are oriented toward peaceful applications."

For an organization devoted to peaceful activities, MRU is rather short of pacifists; its staff includes a group of Dr. Strangeloves with multiple ties to the armaments, aerospace, military, and intelligence establishment. There is undoubtedly much more to the scientific areas in which MRU works than the government would like the ordinary citizen to realize. These scientists are not crackpots, but they are no better than the MKULTRA researchers of the past decades. "Peaceful applications" of their research are the last things on their minds.

### Further Information Sought on Mind Drug Testing

CAIB has received the following letter, which the writer has asked us to publish:

Dear CovertAction:

I am interested in obtaining information about the CIA role in human experimentation and drug use since World War II. Some information has already emerged in congressional hearings and more is in the book by John Marks, but most of the perpetrators of these misdeeds in the scientific and medical community and their institutions are still unknown. Very little has happened to reform or change the practices within the medical and scientific community that permitted these things to happen. In general, the issue remains unacknowledged by the American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association.

As a clinical investigator in psychiatry from 1955 to 1974 I worked at the Lafayette Clinic in Detroit where mind-altering drugs such as Sernyl and LSD were tested. The public paid for these tests because this was a tax supported university and Department of Mental Health institution. The patients and normal subjects on whom these tests were conducted still do not know whether these tests were sponsored by the CIA, the Department of Defense or government scientific agencies. I have lived in California since 1974 and the same issues apply to the major institutions of this state.

An attempt to do psychosurgery in order to "control violence" was stopped at the Lafayette Clinic in 1973 by attorneys representing Michigan Neighborhood Legal Services, the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington with the Medical Committee for Human Rights as plaintiff. We still don't know for sure whether the CIA was a covert sponsor.

The readers of Covert Action could contribute a great deal to stopping these unscientific abuses. We need names and other details about doctors, scientists, institutions, participating foundations, universities, principal investigators, drug companies, and hospitals. More information will lead to exposure of these activities via legal channels such as the Institute for Public Interest Representation of Georgetown University in Washington and the Radical Caucus of the American Psychiatric Association.

Sincerely,
Paul Lowinger, M.D.

San Francisco, CA 94117

## Some Random Notes on the NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY

The National Security Agency (NSA) is the second most secret known agency in the United States government. [The first is the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the existence of which the government denies, although it is another of Washington's poorly kept secrets that the NRO is responsible for the flotilla of spy satellites circling the earth.] The NSA, as discussed in our interview with electronics experts published this issue, engages in broadbeam microwave interception around the globe—it listens in on nearly all electronic communications everywhere.

### The Church Committee

The only public, in-depth look at NSA operations was conducted in late 1975 by the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities (the Church Committee). These hearings are reported in "Volume 5; The National Security Agency and Fourth Amendment Rights," issued by the Church Committee (U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington: 1976). These hearings disclosed Operation Shamrock, a massive interception of telex and cable messages. Little else was disclosed, although the report makes fascinating reading.

### Court Cases

Attempts to pry more information from the NSA met with a major setback in October 1979, when Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden lost their Freedom of Information Act case against the NSA in the District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that, because of the great secrecy of NSA's "mission of collecting foreign intelligence through the monitoring of foreign electromagnetic signals," the NSA was entitled to greater deference than any other agency. Courts should accept without question, it was ruled, the NSA's explanations that disclosure of documents obtained by its monitoring would be harmful to the national security.

For several months, all FOIA suits against the NSA were unsuccessful. However, a victory for disclosure has just been obtained—at least in the lower court—in *Weberman v. NSA*, decided in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 3, 1980. Weberman (the author of the article on Mankind Research Unlimited in this issue) sued to obtain a copy of a telegram sent by Jack Ruby's brother Earl from Detroit, Michigan to Havana, Cuba in April 1962. This document is reputed to figure significantly in the analysis of the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. (Jack Ruby was the person who killed accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.)

The NSA refused to acknowledge the existence or non-existence of the document on the ground that to do so would be to divulge that, in 1962, it had the capability of intercepting telegrams sent from Detroit to Havana. However, the Court noted:
> "There is nothing Secret or Confidential now about Operation Shamrock, if we assume as we must that the unnamed unfriendly foreign intelligence subscribes to the publications of the U.S. Government Printing Office and can read English. Its cover has been blown by the Church Committee which has revealed [the details of Operation Shamrock] for all to read."

If Weberman's victory is upheld in the appellate courts we may yet learn more about NSA operations.

### Cables vs. Telephones

The Church Committee, as noted, reported on the interception of cables and telex communications. It did not specifically deal with private telephone conversations. However, critics of the intrusive methods of the NSA have contended for years that much telephone traffic—especially that over air waves and by satellite—can be and is intercepted by NSA. The latest confirmation came in the testimony of a code-breaking expert, David Kahn, before Congress in March of this year. The NSA, he said, had a "history" of intercepting private American telephone calls.

Vice Admiral Bobby Inman, the Director of the NSA, promptly challenged the testimony, saying that he had investigated such charges and "I cannot find any evidence that it ever occurred." He later said, "The NSA has never targeted or intercepted the conversations of private U.S. citizens."

### The Salisbury Case

Admiral Inman's protestations were soon put to the test. In April the former Associate Editor of the *New York Times*, Harrison E. Salisbury, filed a damage suit against the NSA, contending that it had illegally intercepted and kept records of his private communications. What is more, he backed up his assertions. He had filed an FOIA suit against the CIA, asking for whatever documents it had on him, and was informed by the CIA that they had referred his request, with respect to certain records, to the NSA, from which they had originated. The left hand, it seems, was not telling the right hand what it was doing.

The NSA countered that any records it had on Salisbury—none of which it would turn over—came from "the lawful acquisition of foreign intelligence, and did not result from an investigation of Salisbury." This weasling distinction does not appear in Inman's categorical denial, noted *(Continued on page 27)*

*(Continued from page 36)*

In early March reporters from the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation observed two additions to the United States Embassy in Kingston, Jamaica: two closed-circuit surveillance television cameras mounted on both sides of the Embassy on Oxford Road.

In the space of a few days, three completely inconsistent stories emanated from the U.S. Embassy. One spokesperson, Press Attache John Heller, contacted by JBC News, stated that the cameras were simply there to monitor the parking lots, to reduce the chance of theft. However, almost simultaneously, another official, Security Chief Dennis Williams, told reporters that there were no cameras, that the two devices observed were empty housings for cameras which had never been installed.

It was pointed out that the cameras were not aimed at the parking lot, but were in fact quite strategically pointed, one at the Up Park Army Training Camp, the other at Jamaica House, the Prime Minister's office. Also within the view of the swivel-mounted camera were the headquarters of the Workers Party of Jamaica, the Jamaica Labor Party and the Peoples National Party, as well as the Cuban Embassy. Williams said that the position of the "empty" camera housings was "inadvertent."

[Image: One of the Cameras on the U.S. Embassy in Jamaica. A close-up shot of a surveillance camera mounted on a building.]

The Jamaican Minister of National Security, Dudley Thompson, was not pleased with the several responses, and officially complained to the U.S., noting that it was "unsafe for foreign representatives to have cameras so placed that they could view the operations of the defense forces... and other sensitive areas." On March 11, he insisted that the cameras be removed. On March 12 the American Ambassador announced that he was in "consultations" with his government, and, on March 15, the offensive cameras were removed.

As a JBC report the next day noted, "it's still anybody's guess as to what they [the cameras] really are." Most observers were convinced that the stories presented by the U.S. Embassy authorities were untrue. The placement and angles of the cameras were inconsistent with any desire to observe the parking lots. Moreover, as a local newspaper, *Struggle*, pointed out, "some electronic experts are of the opinion that they are not cameras at all but new laser devices for listening to conversations at very long distances."

That the U.S. backed down so quickly is some indication of the sensitive political situation in Jamaica. However, U.S. interference in Jamaica has been so widespread, and CIA activity so massive, that one can be sure that other methods of technological espionage are hard at work.

### SOURCES AND METHODS (Continued from page 36)

There are, however, much more important domestic political reasons for keeping these new techniques secret. If the public ever becomes keenly aware that the CIA reads people's mail without opening the envelopes, that wiretapping is so automated that computers differentiate voices and topics of conversation and transcribe only those of interest to the eavesdroppers, that spy ships can tell what a city manufactures by listening to its industrial and transportation noises, and that the combination of high-resolution optics, spectrozonal photography, image motion compensation, and electronic image enhancement permit satellite surveillance day and night, even penetrating clouds, not just civil libertarians would be raising questions. Some of the government's expensive proposals might be subjected to strong challenge.

The most obvious conclusion would be that the U.S.S.R. cannot be far behind in developing similar technologies, and, if true, this would absolutely demolish the underlying assumption of the MX missile—the most expensive boondoggle ever foisted upon the American people. If a combination of optical, radio, radiological, seismic, and biological detectors can unerringly determine, as they certainly can, which of the number of siting points is "loaded" with a live missile, and which are either empty or fitted with dummies, the whole rationale for the system becomes unglued. That, however, would shift the public back to a focus on effective disarmament proposals, the thing our militarists fear the most.

## MASS TRANSFER OF HMONG PEOPLE TO CARIBBEAN PROPOSED

The Ecumenical Program for Interamerican Communication and Action (ERICA), a Washington DC-based organization which acts as a consultant to the National Council of Churches, issued a report on May 3, 1980, to the World Council of Churches in Geneva and to the Guyana Human Rights Association that implicates a consortium of U.S. religious groups with the CIA in a plan to bring large numbers of Laotian Hmong people (also known as the Meo, or Hill Tribe people) from Southeast Asia Refugee camps to the South American country of Guyana, scene of the Jonestown massacre. Guyana's present ruler, Forbes Burnham, was helped into power in the sixties by CIA destabilization efforts which channeled funds and personnel through labor and church groups in order to manipulate religion and race and oust the government of Cheddi Jagan from power.

The resettlement effort was first announced in February by Franklin Graham (son of evangelist Billy Graham) as spokesperson for the project that envisioned movement of as many as 100,000 persons from Thailand and Laos to Guyana. Organizers of the project called themselves the Christian Refugee Team International (CRTI) and include the following organizations: Billy Graham Evangelistic Association; World Medical Missions, Inc.; Samaritan's Purse; National Association of Evangelicals and its mission arm, World Relief Corp.; Christian and Missionary Alliance missionaries; and the Netherlands-based groups Zed Ost Asia and Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund. According to published reports this consortium would be entirely responsible for funding relocation costs which have estimated to be eight and one half million dollars.

The report supports charges by Guyanese and Caribbean organizations that the Hmong guerilla fighters would be utilized to supress democratic movements in Guyana and the Caribbean, that Hmong settlements might be intended to bring military presence to the Yarikita region of Guyana which is part of territory claimed by Venezuela, and that Hmong presence would infringe on traditional Amerindian populations in the region. Indeed, opposition to the plan has been so widespread that it has been temporarily scrapped.

The Laotian Hmong slated for this plan number approximately 95,000 of whom 40,000 are located in Northern Thailand refugee camps and another 55,000 still in Laos. Hmong "sky soldiers" (the name given to irregular troops armed and trained by the CIA) continue guerilla warfare against the Lao government. The report contains indications that orders to troops in the field are actively passed from exiled Hmong strong man and opium merchant General Vang Pao from his Montana pig farm to refugee camps via a network of agents placed in refugee "service agencies."

Vang Pao gained prominence during the Viet Nam War era when the CIA, under the direction of Edward Lansdale, established the Hmong as a secret army to wage war against the Pathet Lao liberation forces despite formal U.S. pledges to respect Laotian neutrality. Vang Pao was rescued from a failing military career and made wealthy and powerful through CIA assistance in his establishment of control over both troops and the opium crop.

EPICA's report recounts that "various missionaries from fundamentalist U.S. church groups have been linked to Hmong-CIA involvement" and cites their role in bringing a Roman alphabet to the Hmong as the beginning of penetration by U.S. forces. Reports of missionary combatant clergy and others from voluntary agencies have been directly linked to leadership in Laotian raiding parties by such sources as "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia" by Alfred McCoy and Leonard Adams.

The report links elements of the present CRTI, namely the Christian and Missionary Alliance (CAMA) and associate organizations such as the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL is also known as the Wycliffe Bible Translators) with well documented CIA pacification programs in Southeast Asia. In addition the report cites SIL's recent role in advocating a scheme to resettle a sizeable Hmong group in Bolivia in conjunction with plans to establish a bastion for South African whites fleeing from their crumbling empire. The Summer Institute of Linguistics has been linked to the CIA by *Time* magazine and shares its Washington, D.C. offices with CRTI member, World Relief Corporation. EPICA also notes the "coincidence" that the present U.S. Ambassador to Guyana, George Roberts, was head of the U.S. Mission in Laos just prior to the Guyana assignment and that he was stationed in Laos in the early sixties when the secret army was being organized.

Finally, the report expresses fear the Hmong people—who were largely manipulated into their mercenary role via CIA created dependency on U.S. food drops and the creation of the Air America opium distribution network—will be "completely dependent on others for their survival," thus setting up conditions for further manipulation in their new homes in Guyana or elsewhere in the Caribbean Rim. The report concludes that these factors imply a "revival of the old modus operandi" and quotes World Relief Corp. literature that urges resettlement of refugees in less developed countries "particularly South and Latin America" as evidence that resettlement plans are still in the works despite temporary cessation of the Guyana pilot project. Further, the report indicates the projects like the Guyana endeavor are contemplated or underway in Suriname, French Guiana, and Belize.

## NEWS NOTES

### South African Forgery

The South African government is putting up a smug front, as though the exposure of one of its leading spies, Craig Williamson, is actually an intelligence triumph. There is no doubt that Williamson's spying has hurt the anti-apartheid movement, and that his testimony in forthcoming show trials will be used to jail many opponents of the racist regime, but blowing his cover was no victory for South Africa.

Williamson's tactics as deputy director of the International University Exchange Fund (IUEF) were part of the well-known stock in trade of police provacateurs, and many anti-apartheid activists had suspected him for a long time. The then United Nations Commissioner for Namibia, Sean MacBride had warned his associates to avoid contact with IUEF; last summer African National Congress (ANC) representatives communicated their suspicions about Williamson to the Swedish Foreign Office; and ZANU of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front had also suspected him.

At the same time that Williamson was publicly posing as a hard-line leftist exclusively supporting ANC, SWAPO, and the Patriotic Front, and trying to polarize the movement's politics, IUEF maintained a secret slush fund called Southern Futures in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, whose money was channeled to ANC's rivals, the Pan-Africanist Congress and the ANC (African Nationalists), a splinter group.

Now a new revelation shows even more the desperation of the South African government. In the past the regime has operated on the assumption that its rule was hated by the great majority of Africans, but that it enjoyed the near-unanimous support of the white population, with the exception of a tiny handful of communists. Now that the white opposition is growing rapidly, particularly among young draft-age men, the intelligence services have stepped up their attack on those who are organizing the resistance movement within the South African war machine.

*Omkeer* is a clandestinely circulated newsletter published by white exiles who have deserted from the South African army, urging others to do likewise and to spread opposition to the white regime. Recently a clever forgery of a recent *Omkeer* appeared which, in its own way, reveals both the government's fears of this movement and the tactics being employed against it.

The forgery follows the original closely, but adds to it needlessly offensive language, gross exaggerations of reported facts, and repeated declarations of support for communism and the U.S.S.R., and it changes references so that "apartheid regime" becomes "anti-communist regime" and "liberation movements and the world-wide campaigns intent on destroying apartheid" becomes "Marxist movements so that Communism could rule the world." Since even these alterations cannot be trusted to alienate all potential recipients of the bogus *Omkeer*, the instructions on how to escape the country have been altered in ways that will lead the unwary directly into the police state dragnet.

### Former CIA Agent Admits Bombing in Canada

William Lou Richardson, a self-admitted CIA agent during the years 1968-69, testified in a Canadian court in March that he had recently constructed two bombs intended to disrupt union activities in Toronto, and that since entering Canada in 1971 he had made and planted numerous other bombs to frame what he called union radicals. Richardson said that his most recent effort was to be planted in the car of a United Auto Workers official at the Ontario plant of Douglas Aircraft. The former CIA agent made the bomb while working undercover as a paid informer at McDonnell-Douglas of Canada Ltd., collecting information on an alleged takeover of the union by "radicals." "I feel planting the bomb was justified.... There was never any doubt in my mind that the bombs were anything but legal," he told the court.

Richardson was testifying for the prosecution in the trial of two other industrial spies, Daniel McGarry, President of Centurian Investigation Ltd., and his former undercover chief, William Nykyforchyn, both of whom were charged with conspiracy to commit public mischief by misleading the police and causing the arrest of an immigrant suspected of sabotaging a metal products company. The prosecution charged that the two men planted stolen tools, a bomb, and hashish oil in the car of union activist, Basim Dieffallah.

The prosecution introduced Richardson's testimony to show that his activities were similar to those of the defendants and other private investigators working for Centurian.

According to the *Canadian Tribune*, Richardson had also made "a short-lived attempt to infiltrate the Communist Party but was exposed and summarily expelled."

CAIB suspects that Richardson's work with the CIA in 1968-69 was of a similar nature and that he was probably involved with Operation CHAOS—the CIA's still secret and illegal operation of spying on and framing anti-war activists. Anyone having information on Richardson is requested to write to us.

## BRITISH CONTINUE DOING THE CIA'S BIDDING

**By Louis Wolf**

It was a cold winter's night—December 26, 1979—as I deplaned at London's Heathrow Airport for a brief visit. I had just arrived from Hamburg, West Germany, where I had spent Christmas with Philip Agee and his family.

The young immigration officer looked at my passport and asked the usual questions—how long would I be in Britain, the purpose of my visit, etc. As he did so, he never once looked up at me. His 4-inch-thick "black book" was opened to the page of names beginning with "WO," and I couldn't help but notice that while most of the entries contained two lines of text, the entry next to my name, which I couldn't read, was three lines in length. The officer stamped my passport with "given leave to enter the United Kingdom for six months," even though I said I would only be there for several days.

I walked through the gate and was proceeding toward the luggage area when, somewhat timidly, the same officer tapped me on the shoulder and inquired if I was the same person whom he had just given leave to enter. When I replied in the affirmative, he asked if I would come with him to answer a few questions. The "few questions" turned out to be an understatement. I was taken into custody by the British Customs and held for nearly twenty-four hours—undoubtedly at the request of the CIA.

The officer went over the usual questions, repeating what had been asked earlier. Thus far, Philip Agee's name had not arisen. He then took me to the customs table nearby and, after he whispered something in the ear of the customs man, I watched as the latter went through my bags with a fine-tooth-comb. He looked inside my shoes, behind my shirt collars, and even shook each piece of dirty laundry, all without success, but apparently in hopes of finding drugs, a weapon, or some such article.

He opened my briefcase and looked through the papers and books haphazardly—I had the distinct impression he was better at searching than he was at reading. He came upon copies of "Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe" and "Dirty Work 2: The CIA in Africa," with my name on the covers and my photograph on the back of one, but somehow neither he nor the immigration officer who was standing nearby seemed to take much notice. It was only when he found some copies of several issues of *CovertAction Information Bulletin* and opened one to the article "Robert Moss's Obsession," by Philip Agee (Number 7), that the mood of both officers changed markedly. The customs man handed the magazine to the immigration officer who, after a pause, asked me if I was associated with Philip Agee (who had been deported from Britain in 1977); I replied that I was. He looked at me peculiarly and I got the first inkling that I might be in for a long night.

I was unceremoniously marched back to an enclosed waiting area, and found myself with an Iranian and a Nigerian whose entries into Britain were also being delayed. During the next several hours there was a bustle of activity in the office, mostly out of my earshot. Another official stood silently over everyone else, and was continually deferred to by everyone, including the chief immigration officer; he was undoubtedly the man from Special Branch (the domestic intelligence people).

It was nearly midnight when the senior immigration officer and the younger one came over and, somewhat sheepishly handed me two papers, saying, "Mr. Wolf, I'm terribly sorry for the delay; would you please read these." One cancelled my leave to enter, and the other refused me leave to enter. The latter contained this typed statement: "from information available to me, I understand that you are an active associate of Mr. Philip Agee" who is persona non grata in this country and in view of your character, conduct and associations in this connection it seems right that your exclusion is conducive to the public good. I therefore cancel your leave to enter." Also typed in was a British Airways flight back to Hamburg the next afternoon, on which it was proposed I should be a passenger.

It was only at this point that I was finally allowed to call an attorney, to let him know what was happening. He said the reversal of permission with, in fact, no justification, was unusual, and he hoped it could be countermanded. Particularly ludicrous was the reference to my character and conduct, when nothing about that had been raised.

I was then taken through the Heathrow maze to the airport "Detention Suite," as it is quaintly called. On the way, the driver confided to me, "It's not often we get Americans in here." On arrival, I was logged in and sent to a room where several others were already asleep.

Early the next morning, one of the guards came around, shouting in each door, "Wakey, wakey." In a few minutes "breakfast" was served—soggy cornflakes, stale bread and tea. I looked around and saw about sixty men, almost all of them from the Third World, including a large number of Iranians being turned away, like the others, ostensibly for invalid visas, lack of funds, or just hesitation when aggressively questioned by the immigration officers—in a language they did not usually speak fluently. It was clear the real reason had to do with the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran the month before.

Other detainees told me of their experiences. A Kenyan was called "nigger," and told pointblank he didn't look intelligent enough to be attending the University of London, to which, in fact, he had a scholarship. A Pakistani was called "Paki"—an equally derogatory term, and told to go back where he came from; "we don't want you here taking our jobs and our houses away from us." I saw more than half the people forcibly put on planes home, though for most of them their life savings, or their parents', had been used to enable them to travel to Britain. None of them was fortunate, as I was, to know a lawyer in Britain. The scene was most upsetting.

[Image: A cartoon depicting several stereotypical "foreign" figures looking dejected, with a sign "NO VACANCY" in the background, symbolizing restrictive immigration policies.]

My lawyer's negotiations with the Home Office were finally successful. They admitted—apparently a rarity—that I was indeed in the Black Book, but, after several more hours of waffling, my return to the airport lounge, and yet more questioning, I was eventually given permission to enter Britain for four days—all I eventually asked for.

*NSA (Continued from page 22)*
above. What, after all, is the difference if the NSA does not "target" private conversations, but merely engages in "foreign intelligence gathering" which, coincidentally, involves just happening to record some private conversations?

### Our Man in London

A series of articles published in England in 1975 and 1976—mostly in *Time Out* and *Red Weekly*—began the process of uncovering more than a hundred CIA and NSA personnel at the London U.S. Embassy. As noted in "Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe," "A separate operation, also officially under cover of the Department of State—the Office of the Special U.S. Liaison Officer (SUSLO)—appears to be a cover unit for the National Security Agency, rather than for the CIA." Confirmation appears in recent United Kingdom Diplomatic Lists. High on the U.S. list, just two names below that of Edward W. Proctor, "Political Attache" and in fact the CIA Chief of Station, appears this entry: "Mr. Benson K. Buffham, Political Attache, c/o Embassy."

A glance at the Church Committee Volume 5, cited above, describes the witness as follows: "Lieutenant General Lew Allen, Jr., Director, National Security Agency; accompanied by Benson Buffham, Deputy Director, NSA." Mr. Buffham's Political Attache job seems to be, as they say in the trade, rather "light cover." For an agency so steeped in secrecy as the NSA, it is pitiful.

## S.E.C. AND I.R.S. KNUCKLE UNDER TO CIA PRESSURES

In April two major criminal investigations, involving In April two major criminal investigations, involving years of painstaking work, were abruptly discontinued at the insistence of the CIA. While it is unfortunate that massive illegal conduct goes unpunished, at least the public nature of the discontinuances throws some more light on the operations at the spy agency.

### Airline Proprietaries

It has been known for a long time that the CIA owned, in whole or in part, a stable of airlines around the world—mostly small outfits working in Third World countries. They provided excellent cover for CIA operatives in hard to reach areas.

The settlement of *Securities and Exchange Commission v. Page Airways, Inc.*, reported in the April 8, 1980 *Wall Street Journal*, indicates how much more than simply providing cover is involved. The S.E.C. was after Page for foreign bribery charges. The asserted recipients included Idi Amin of Uganda, President Bongo of Gabon, a government minister in Malaysia, the Ivory Coast's Ambassador to the United States, and officials in Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Page once gave Amin a Cadillac convertible at the same time it was subcontracting its Uganda operations to Southern Air Transport—for many years a CIA-owned proprietary. Page was particularly active in areas where the Soviet Union also had representation, especially situations where there were Soviet air force advisors present. The suitability of Page for CIA observation is obvious.

The S.E.C. filed its case in 1978, and was prepared to nail the company, and six executives, for numerous criminal offenses. But the CIA intervened and demanded that the charges be dropped, and the case settled. It didn't want, according to the *Wall Street Journal*, "to risk unraveling an overseas intelligence-gathering mission in which Page participated, whether wittingly or unwittingly, by paying hefty sales commissions to foreign officials deemed friendly to the U.S."

[Image: A cartoon of a shady figure in a trench coat and fedora, with dark glasses, holding a smoking gun and a briefcase overflowing with money, representing a stereotypical spy or corrupt agent.]

### Off-Shore Banking

Because of strict anti-disclosure laws, the Bahama Islands provide a favorite banking spot not merely for investors, but also for tax evaders and organized crime—all anxious to limit the possible scrutiny of their finances. Apparently the Bahamas are also the banking center for the CIA, and their involvement has caused the Justice Department to drop what could have been, in the words of the *Wall Street Journal*, "the biggest tax evasion case of all time."

The Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department have been looking into the operations of the Castle Bank in Nassau, Bahamas since the early 1970s. The bank was evidently a favorite of several Mafia higher-ups and quite a few merely crooked businessmen. It was being used to hide the unlawful (and untaxed) cash of literally hundreds of tax evasion suspects.

Unfortunately for the I.R.S. investigators—many of whom resigned in disgust when the cases crumbled—it was also the CIA's bank. It was, according to the *Journal*, "the conduit for millions of dollars earmarked by the CIA for the funding of clandestine operations against Cuba and for other covert intelligence operations directed at countries in Latin America and the Far East." The bank had been set up and controlled by the late Paul Lionel Edward Helliwell, a Miami lawyer who had worked for the CIA from the early 1950s until his death in 1976. He had supplied weapons and equipment from the CIA to the Nationalist Chinese in Burma from 1951 to 1961; he was referred to as a "Paymaster" for the Bay of Pigs invasion; and he was "deeply involved" in the series of actions against Cuba from Andros Island in the Bahamas between 1964 and 1975.

The Castle Bank goes on, with about a quarter of a billion dollars in U.S. owned accounts. Presumably much of that remains CIA funds.

## NAMING NAMES

This column will continue to be a regular feature of the *CovertAction Information Bulletin*; we do not believe that it can be constitutionally suppressed by the government. If any of the proposed laws designed to censor this column out of existence are passed, we can assure our readers that we will fight them in the courts.

With this issue, in any event, we present forty CIA officers and one Pentagon intelligence chief. They comprise thirteen Chiefs of Station, eight Deputy Chiefs of Station, and nineteen senior case officers, from, in all, thirty-one countries.

### Algeria

We have located **Norman M. Descoteaux** at the Algiers, Algeria Embassy, where he is undoubtedly the Chief of Station. Descoteaux, whose biography appears in "Dirty Work: The CIA in Europe," was the Chief of Station in Kingston, Jamaica, exposed by Philip Agee in his 1976 tour of that island. Descoteaux, born June 15, 1936 in Maine, first served under military cover as a "political analyst" with the Department of the Army from 1962 to 1965, when he assumed his first post under diplomatic cover, as a political assistant at the Guayaquil, Ecuador Consulate General. In 1967 he was transferred to Buenos Aires, Argentina, as a political officer, and in 1970 he resumed military cover as a "program coordination officer" with the Department of the Army. In 1973 he was back again in Ecuador as a political officer in Guayaquil. He returned briefly to Headquarters in 1975, and late that year assumed his post as Chief of Station in Kingston, where he played a major role in the unsuccessful destabilization campaign against the Michael Manley government. He left Jamaica, being replaced there by Dean J. Almy, Jr. (as noted in CAIB Number 1), sometime in 1978, and, as of January 1980, our sources note his presence at the Algiers Embassy.

Another case officer in Algiers is **Claude Patrick Connelly**, born September 26, 1943. Connelly served in the Calcutta, India Consulate General from 1972 to 1975 as an economic-commercial officer, before being transferred to the Colombo, Sri Lanka Embassy. While we are not certain how long he remained in Colombo, our sources indicate that as of at least November 1979 he was stationed at the Algiers Embassy.

### Argentina

The CIA officer who is the Deputy Chief of Station in Argentina (under Joseph A. DiStefano, reported in CAIB Number 2), is **Conrad C. Schubert**, born July 28, 1927 in New Jersey. Schubert entered the CIA under military cover, working for the Department of the Army from 1952 to 1960, at which time he switched to Air Force cover until 1965. That year he commenced diplomatic cover as Attache and political officer at the Santiago, Chile Embassy. In 1966 he was transferred to Buenos Aires, Argentina, still as a political officer. In 1970 he was back at Headquarters until at least 1975, from which time there are no records regarding his whereabouts. However, our sources have indicated to us that at least as of January 1980 he was posted once again to the political section of the Buenos Aires Embassy, probably to become the CIA Chief of Station upon the departure of DiStefano.

### Austria

The Chief of Station in Vienna, Austria is veteran CIA officer **David Warner Forden**, born September 11, 1930 in New York. Forden also first served with the Agency under military cover, as a plans officer with the Department of the Army from 1956 to 1962. State Department records note that from 1962 to 1964 he was in "private experience" as a "consultant" for a "management consulting firm." This was obviously further CIA work in "deep cover" with some private firm, perhaps an Agency proprietary. It would of course be of considerable interest if any CAIB reader should come across any reference to the company which employed Mr. Forden. In 1965, after Polish language training, he was posted, now under State Department cover, as Attache and political officer in the Warsaw, Poland Embassy. Later that year he became Second Secretary, and remained in Poland until 1967, when he returned to headquarters. In 1970 he was posted overseas again, this time to the Mexico City, Mexico Embassy, now Deputy Chief of Station. As of late 1973 he was back again at Headquarters; no records relating to his whereabouts have been located until he appears on the October 1979 Vienna Diplomatic List, which states that he arrived in Austria to take up the cover post of Attache in August 1978. As far as CAIB can ascertain, Forden is still there, and the Chief of Station.

Forden's Deputy Chief of Station appears to be **Arthur H. Stimson**, born January 5, 1927. Stimson served as CIA Chief of Base in the Munich, Federal Republic of Germany Consulate General, under cover as a political officer, from 1972 to 1976. The next record uncovered relating to his whereabouts is the same Vienna Diplomatic List of October 1979, which indicates that he assumed his post there in April 1979.

[Image: A cartoon of a stereotypical spy figure in a trench coat and fedora, with dark glasses, looking furtive. Another similar figure is in the background.]

### Bolivia

A senior case officer serving since late 1978 in La Paz, Bolivia, is **Walter C. D'Andrade**, born October 21, 1940 in Massachusetts. D'Andrade's diplomatic covers have included economic officer in the Recife, Brazil Consulate General from 1964 to 1967; political officer at the Lisbon, Portugal Embassy from 1968 to 1970; and political officer at the Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Consulate General from 1972 to 1975. During the intervals he appears to have been stationed back at Headquarters in Langley. In September 1978, after another stint at Headquarters, he appeared in the political section of the La Paz Embassy.

### Burundi

As of at least September 1979, the new Chief of Station in Bujumbura, Burundi is **David M. Ransom**, whose biography is found in "Dirty Work 2: The CIA in Africa." Ransom, born August 26, 1944, served in Abidjan, Ivory Coast from 1972 to 1974; in Dakar, Senegal from 1974 to 1975; and in Nouakchott, Mauritania from 1975 to 1977, when he returned to Headquarters for a respite from his African CIA career. As of September 1979 our sources indicate that he has been at the Bujumbura Embassy, undoubtedly as Chief of Station. Ransom replaces George H. Hazelrigg, the Chief of Station noted in CAIB Number 2.

### Canada

In September 1978, CAIB editors, speaking in Toronto, informed the audience that the Chief of Station in Ottawa was the notorious Stacy B. Hulse, Jr., the former Chief of Station in Greece, who had unsuccessfully attempted to thwart the overthrow of the junta (and who was Richard Welch's immediate predecessor—and the original target of the group which assassinated Welch). Newspaper reporters who attempted to reach Hulse were informed by the Embassy that he had, coincidentally, just left Canada. Hulse had, indeed, reached acceptable retirement age, whether his rapid departure was coincidental or not. CAIB has now learned that his successor, and still Chief of Station at the Ottawa, Canada Embassy is **John Kenneth Knaus**, born May 30, 1923 in Iowa. U.S. government records show that Knaus, after receiving his BA, MA, and PhD at Stanford University served in an "unspecified government service" from 1951 to 1956, indicating that he has been with the Agency for nearly 30 years. In 1956 he appeared as a "foreign affairs officer" with the U.S. Information Agency, now the International Communication Agency, and on occasion a cooperative CIA cover agency, where he served until 1958. From 1958 to 1972 there are no entries regarding him in the Department of State records. Then, in May 1972 he surfaced as a political officer at the Tokyo, Japan Embassy where he served until late 1974, when he returned to Headquarters for at least two years. The records are silent from 1976 to 1978; then, in the November 1978 and June 1979 Ottawa Diplomatic Lists he is found as an Attache at the Ottawa Embassy—clearly Stacy Hulse's successor as Chief of Station.

[Image: Another cartoon of two stereotypical spy figures, one handing a briefcase to the other.]

### Colombia

A senior case officer now in the Bogota, Colombia Embassy is **Charles Stephen Smith**, born November 22, 1936 in Missouri. Smith, whose full biography appears in "Dirty Work," served from 1964 to 1966 in the tell-tale cover position of "program analyst" for the Department of the Army, when he moved to the Agency for International Development as "assistant program officer" and "community analyst" in Vientiane, Laos, until mid-1969. From 1969 to 1974 he does not appear in State Department records. Then he resurfaced as a political liaison officer at the Madrid, Spain Embassy. In January 1978 he returned to Headquarters, and, in May of that year, he was posted to Bogota where, we are informed by our source in Bogota, he is found in the Consular section.

### Ecuador

Our sources indicate that the new Chief of Station in Quito, Ecuador is **Robert Clayton Brown**, born October 9, 1924 in Illinois. Brown has been with the Agency since at least 1957, and possibly ever since he graduated from Syracuse University in 1950. In 1957 he was posted to Munich, Federal Republic of Germany, as a "geographic analyst" for the Department of the Army. In 1965 he moved to another form of cover, this time AID, as an assistant program officer in Bogota, Colombia, where he served until 1967, when he returned to Headquarters. In 1970 he was back under diplomatic cover as a political officer at the San Jose, Costa Rica Embassy—in fact Deputy Chief of Station; in 1973 he was transferred, in the same capacity, to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he served until at least 1976, becoming, in 1974, Chief of Station. Records for the next two years do not mention him; as of December 1978, however, he was posted to the political section in Quito, again as Chief of Station.

### Finland

We have located a case officer in the Helsinki, Finland Embassy, serving under the new Chief of Station, Robert T. Dumaine, uncovered in CAIB Number 6. He is **John David Stranford**. Stranford's State Department records are scant, indicating that he was an economic-commercial officer at the Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Consulate General from 1974 to 1977, and that, as of at least September 1979 he was Third Secretary at the Helsinki Embassy. However, information available to CAIB confirms that he is, in fact, a CIA case officer.

### France

Significant changes have been uncovered by our sources regarding the Paris, France CIA station. For one thing, Eugen Burgstaller, the long-time Chief of Station has left (and, testified last month before Congress, admitting his CIA employment); for another, Francis John Jeton, the CIA's Paris-based chief of Africa operations has also left. Our sources have indicated that Burgstaller was replaced by **James M. Potts** and Jeton was replaced by **Serge Taube**. However, as their biographies, outlined below, indicate, it is logical to assume that Potts has taken over Jeton's job, and Taube is now Deputy to **Edwin Franklin Atkins**, who, as noted in CAIB Number 3, was transferred to Paris in late 1978, and is now filling the ailing Burgstaller's position. (Burgstaller's and Atkins's biographies appear in "Dirty Work;" Jeton's is found in "Dirty Work 2.")

**James M. Potts**, born September 9, 1921 in Louisiana, has been with the CIA since at least 1951, when he commenced ten years undercover as an "analyst" with the Department of the Army. From 1960 to 1964 and from 1968 to 1972 he served in Athens, Greece, first as Deputy Chief of Station, and then, after a tour at Headquarters, as Chief of Station. In 1972 he returned to Langley as Deputy Chief of the Africa Division, moving up, in 1974 to Chief of the Division, where, for the next two years he spent his most notorious period as the director of CIA Angola operations. His role has been fully described by John Stockwell in "In Search of Enemies." He was also intimately involved in the Space Research Corporation scandal involving the illegal shipment of arms to South Africa. His whereabouts from 1976, after the conclusion of the Angola fiasco, until September 1979, is not known to us. However, extremely reliable sources relate that at that time he was posted to the Paris Embassy. Although, as noted, his arrival did not exactly coincide with Jeton's departure, his background demonstrates that he must be filling the crucially important role of chief of Africa operations. The role of Paris as the center of western operations aimed at Africa is well-documented. The French, of course, play a major role in Africa in their own right, and for a long time it has also been the center of U.S. activity.

**Serge Taube**, born December 2, 1931 in New York has been with the Agency since 1956, and he commenced work under diplomatic cover in late 1957 as a political assistant at the Jakarta, Indonesia Embassy. In 1960 he returned to Headquarters, and in late 1962 was posted to Vientiane, Laos, as a political officer. Three years later he moved to the Rangoon, Burma Embassy, as an economic officer, returned to Headquarters in 1967, and, in 1969, was posted to Moscow, U.S.S.R. In 1971 he returned again to Headquarters, where he remained until 1973. There are no entries relating to him in State Department records from 1973 to 1977, when he appeared briefly at Headquarters before posting, again, to Jakarta, by this time as Chief of Station. Then, according to our sources, he was transferred, as of at least January 1980, to Paris.

### Guatemala

Our sources both in Washington and in Guatemala have enabled us to uncover the Chief of Station, the Deputy Chief of Station, and two senior case officers, in this strategically important Latin American nation. The Chief of Station at the Guatemala City, Guatemala Embassy is **V. Harwood Blocker, III**, born October 19, 1936 in France (of American parents). Blocker has been with the Agency since at least 1963, when he first appeared in State Department records, while briefly at CIA Headquarters in Langley before his first posting, in early 1964, to the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic Embassy as a political officer. From 1966 to 1968 he was back at Headquarters, and then posted to the Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Embassy. In 1970 he moved to the Recife, Brazil Consulate General, and in late 1973 was back at Headquarters. We have found no State Department entries covering 1974 and early 1975, but by May 1975 he was posted to the Lima, Peru Embassy as a political officer, serving, in fact, as CIA Deputy Chief of Station. In October 1977 he was transferred to Guatemala City, now Chief of Station, and was still there at least as of a month ago. He speaks fluent Portuguese.

Blocker's Deputy Chief of Station is **Peggy M. Maggard**. While we do not possess Ms. Maggard's date of birth, one of our sources, who has met her, informed CAIB that she is at least 50 years of age. This would suggest that upon the departure of Blocker she might assume the Chief of Station position. Maggard first appears in State Department records in April 1964, at Headquarters. In 1965 she was posted to Mexico City, Mexico, ostensibly as a clerk-stenographer. (If this was truly her job, it indicates the remarkable opportunities for advancement in the CIA.) In 1968 she was posted to the Caracas, Venezuela Embassy, now as a political assistant, and remained there until at least 1970. No entries have been found in State Department records for the period from 1970 to 1979, during which she clearly advanced in the ranks. According to our sources, she arrived in Guatemala City at least as of October 1979, as the Deputy Chief of Station.

**Joel H. Beyer** is one of the CIA case officers exposed in Kingston, Jamaica by Philip Agee in 1976. Prior thereto, Beyer, born April 13, 1934, had served in La Paz, Bolivia from 1970 to 1972, and in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic from 1972 till mid-1975, when he was posted to Jamaica. In February 1977, a few months after his exposure, he was back at Headquarters. Our sources indicate that as of October 1977 he had been transferred to the Guatemala City Embassy as a political officer, in fact, a senior CIA case officer.

Finally, our sources have noted the presence in Guatemala City, since December 1978, of **Michael J. Dubbs**, born August 28, 1943, another case officer. Dubbs served as a political officer at the Sao Paulo, Brazil Consulate General from 1969 to 1973, when he returned to Headquarters. The next reference noted places him at the Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Consulate General from 1975 to 1978, when, as noted, he was transferred to Guatemala City.

### Guyana

Several sources have led CAIB to conclude that the new Deputy Chief of Station in Georgetown, Guyana is **James Lee Adkins**, born March 22, 1935. Adkins was under cover as a political officer at the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic Embassy from 1971 to 1974. The next record found indicates that from 1976 to 1979 he served at the Santiago, Chile Embassy, in the economic section, before being transferred, in January 1979, to Georgetown.

### Haiti

The Chief of Station in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, who appears on the January 1980 Port-au-Prince Diplomatic List, is **William C. Wagner, Jr.** Wagner served from 1970 to 1973 in the Santiago, Chile Embassy, and from 1973 to 1975 at the Montevideo, Uruguay Embassy, both times under cover as a Consular officer. We have no information for the period from 1976 to 1978, when, after a brief stop at Headquarters, he was transferred to Haiti, becoming, certainly by this year, Chief of Station. Wagner's biography indicates that he must be a specialist in dealing with the extreme right wing.

A case officer serving under Wagner is **David M. Buss**. The Diplomatic List indicates he arrived in Haiti in August, 1979.

### India

An experienced case officer, the Deputy Chief of Station in New Delhi, India, is **William Wood Douglass**, born October 31, 1933 in Tennessee. Records indicate that he joined the CIA in 1955. Douglass first appears as a consular assistant in the Damascus, Syria Embassy, from 1959 till 1963, when he returned to Headquarters. In 1964 he was transferred to Beirut, Lebanon as an Attache and an Arabic language trainee. In 1966 he was posted to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and in 1969 was again back at Headquarters. In 1971 he was back in Beirut, this time as an economic-commercial officer, and in 1973 returned home again. No entries have been found covering 1976 to 1979, but our New Delhi sources confirm that as of at least September 1979 he was at the New Delhi Embassy in the political section, in fact, the CIA Deputy Chief of Station.

Another case officer stationed in New Delhi is **Waldimir Skotzko**, born November 6, 1941 in Washington, D.C. Records indicate that Skotzko served under military cover from 1965 to 1970 in the uncommon guise of "editorial assistant." In 1970 he transferred to Department of State cover, and in 1971 was posted to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, after language training in Serbo-Croatian. In 1973 he was back for more language training, and was sent the next year to the Tehran, Iran Embassy. In 1978 he was transferred to Kathmandu, Nepal, returned late that year to Headquarters, and, as of December 1979 was posted to the political section in the New Delhi Embassy.

### Japan

A senior case officer in the Tokyo, Japan Embassy is **Juan F. Noriega**, born March 1, 1933 in New Jersey. Records state that Noriega served privately from 1964 to 1966 as an "advisor" to an unspecified country, quite unusual cover. Our sources confirm that the country was, in fact, Nicaragua, and Noriega's job was the training of Somoza's bodyguards. From 1966 to 1969 he was stationed under State Department cover as a political officer at the Montevideo, Uruguay Embassy, a position noted by Philip Agee in "Inside the Company." He was back at Headquarters from 1969 to 1971, when he was transferred to Mexico City, Mexico, still as a political officer. No entries have been found for the period from late 1972 until late 1979, when, in October, he was transferred to the Tokyo Embassy.

### Jerusalem

Reliable sources confirm that the Chief of Base for the CIA in Jerusalem is **Stephen Elroy Montgomery**, born October 29, 1936 in Kentucky. Montgomery first appears under State Department cover in 1966, as a linguistics intern. However, that same year he assumed the giveaway cover of "political analyst" for the Department of the Air Force (indicating that he was recruited from the State Department by the CIA), until 1968, when he went back under diplomatic cover, posted to the Calcutta, India Consulate General as a political assistant. In 1969 he moved to the Madras, India Consulate General as an economic-commercial officer, and in 1971 was transferred to Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), as a political-economic officer. In 1975 he was back at Headquarters, and, although no entries have been found for 1976 and most of 1977, as of October 1977 he was posted to the Jerusalem Consulate General, and is listed on the Jerusalem Consular List of February 1980. He is clearly the Chief of Base in this politically and historically critical city.

### Libya

CAIB's sources have uncovered a case officer at the Tripoli, Libya Embassy, **Kenneth Mitchell Sapp**. Sapp was posted to the Bombay, India Consulate General in 1978, serving ostensibly as Vice-Consul, and, as of at least November 1979 was transferred to Tripoli.

### Mali

The new Chief of Station in Bamako, Mali is **Danny M. Loftin**, born March 8, 1943. Loftin, whose biography appears in "Dirty Work," was undercover from 1968 to 1972 as a "research analyst" for an unspecified government agency, and in 1972 was posted to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. In 1973 he was briefly back at Headquarters before posting to the Leningrad, U.S.S.R. Consulate General. In 1976 he was at the Geneva, Switzerland Mission, and, according to our sources, he was at Bamako at least as of December 1979. In an interesting example of creative research, a CAIB reader noticed, as set forth in "Dirty Work," that State Department records indicate Loftin received a Master's Degree from the University of Kentucky in 1967. The records of that institution, however, show no master's thesis under the name of Loftin ever filed. Mali may have been shortchanged!

### Nepal

We have uncovered a case officer assigned to the Kathmandu, Nepal Embassy, **James M. Senner**, born October 2, 1942 in Wisconsin. After signing up with the CIA in 1968, he entered upon State Department cover in 1969, with Farsi language training, and was posted in 1970 to the Kabul, Afghanistan Embassy as a political officer, and shortly thereafter, as a consular officer. In 1974 he was moved to the Madras, India Consulate General as a political officer. As of at least December 1979 he was at the Kathmandu Embassy.

### Nigeria

Several sources have confirmed to CAIB that a case officer in Lagos, Nigeria is **Paul Fisher Bradley**. Bradley served under diplomatic cover at the La Paz, Bolivia Embassy from 1977 to 1979. Our sources indicate that as of at least October 1979 Bradley was transferred to the Lagos Embassy.

### Norway

The Deputy Chief of Station at the Oslo, Norway Embassy is, according to our sources there, **Robert A. Dooling**, born September 26, 1933 in Kentucky. Records indicate that Dooling served as an "analyst" with an unspecified government agency from 1962 to 1963. The next entry states that as of late 1966 he was under cover as a foreign affairs officer in the Europe Department of the State Department. There are no entries for the period 1974 to 1978. Then, as of at least January 1979 he appears as an Attache at the Oslo Embassy, according to the October 1979 Oslo Diplomatic List. He is serving under Chief of Station William E. Camp, noted in CAIB Number 6.

### Pakistan

A senior case office in the Islamabad, Pakistan Embassy is **David Edward Thurman**, born November 30, 1937 in Missouri. State Department records indicate unspecified government experience from 1960 to 1962 and from 1965 to 1966, with Kansas State College in between. In 1967 Thurman was posted to the Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) Embassy as a political officer. In 1972 he was back at Headquarters, and in 1973 he was posted to the Karachi, Pakistan Consulate General as a consular officer. He is not listed in State Department records from 1976 to 1978. Then, as of at least January 1979, he is found at the Islamabad Embassy.

### Singapore

Mentioned on the August 1979 Singapore Diplomatic List is a senior case officer, **Edward Robert McGivern**. McGivern, born April 19, 1936 in Montana, was an "editor" for the Department of the Army in 1964, and then spent the next two years "on loan" to AID as a province officer in Vietnam, before returning to his interesting cover as an editor in 1968. This suggests that McGivern was a part of the CIA Vietnam operations in the heyday of Operation Phoenix, the Agency's massive assassination program. In late 1968 he commenced diplomatic cover, at the Taichung, Taiwan Foreign Service Institute language school. In 1969 he was posted to the then Embassy at Taipei, Taiwan as a political officer. In 1973 he was posted to the Rangoon, Burma Embassy, as a political-economic officer. In 1976 he returned to Headquarters though we have found no information covering 1977 to 1978. Then, as of November 1978 he was at the Singapore Embassy, as Second Secretary.

### Sri Lanka

In CAIB Number 6 we reported the presence of a senior case officer at the Colombo, Sri Lanka Embassy, **Richard W. Rauh**. Our sources, both in Washington and in Sri Lanka, indicate that Rauh is now definitely the Chief of Station, having filled the post formerly held by Jack S. Ogino, who, as noted in CAIB Number 8, left Colombo around September 1979 to become Chief of Station in Beirut, Lebanon.

### Sudan

**Robert Ervin McCall, III**, a case officer whose biography appears in "Dirty Work 2" and in CAIB Number 4, has been transferred, according to our source, to the Khartoum, Sudan Embassy, as of October 1979. Since 1977, McCall had been at the Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Embassy in the consular section.

### Swaziland

**Wilfred J. A. Charette**, whose biography appears in "Dirty Work 2," has left his post as Deputy Chief of Station in Accra, Ghana and moved to the Chief of Station slot at the Mbabane, Swaziland Embassy, as of February 1980, according to sources there. Prior to this service in Ghana, Charette had served as Attache in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

### Tunisia

We have located a case officer in the Tunis, Tunisia Embassy, **William Baker Carleton**. Carleton served from 1973 to 1975 at the Rabat, Morocco Embassy, first as a clerk in the political section and then as a political officer. There are no entries on him in State Department records from 1975 to 1978, when he appeared at the Tehran, Iran Embassy. As of at least September 1979 he was transferred to Tunis, in the economic section.

### United Kingdom

We have located a senior case office in the London, United Kingdom Embassy. He is **Thomas Edward Carroll**, born September 17, 1936 in New York. Carroll was serving as a political assistant in the Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Embassy from 1963 to 1965, when he was transferred to the Sao Paulo, Brazil Consulate General, as a political officer. In 1968 he was back at Headquarters. The next record entries indicate that he was at the Santiago, Chile Embassy from July 1973 until at least August 1975, indicating that he was part of the CIA team which worked with, and supported, the bloody Pinochet coup of September 1973. Record entries are again lacking from 1975 to 1979, when, as the London Diplomatic Lists indicate, he surfaced, in April 1979, as an administrative attache at the London Embassy.

### Zaire

CAIB's sources have confirmed that **Dwight Spaulding Burgess**, whose biography is given in "Dirty Work 2," and who is there located at the Lubumbashi, Zaire Consulate, is, in fact, the Chief of Base for the CIA in this critical African ally of the United States.

### Zambia

**Robert K. Simpson**, a senior case officer whose biography appears in "Dirty Work," is located, as of at least November 1979, in the Lusaka, Zambia Embassy, in the economic section. From 1971 to 1976 Simpson, born December 1, 1940 in Rhode Island, was a political officer at the Helsinki, Finland Embassy. In 1976 he was transferred to the Madrid, Spain Embassy, where he served until at least late 1978. Our sources confirm that he has been in Lusaka since at least November 1979.

### The Pentagon

Military sources have noted that **Major General James Arthur Williams**, born March 29, 1932 in New Jersey, a 1954 West Point Graduate, was appointed in March 1980 the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence of the United States Army.

## Sources and Methods

**By Ken Lawrence**

### THE POLITICS OF INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY

Modern spying is known universally as one of the frontiers of technological advance, and nearly all the high-cost listings in the intelligence budget go for these items: spy satellites; U-2, SR-71 and the new TR-1 spy planes; spy submarines and various kinds of surface vessels, from the *Liberty* and *Pueblo* to the *Glomar Explorer*; manned electronic "listening posts" such as those formerly kept in Iran and Afghanistan, and still in use in Turkey, Pakistan, and Scandinavia; nuclear-fueled remote "electronic eyes and ears" in the Himalayas, etc.

There is some irony in the fact that, despite the billions of dollars spent on these devices, whenever one of them is found out the cover story is always monotonously the same: it didn't work. Thus, when Francis Gary Powers was shot down in his U-2 over the Soviet Union, the first word out of Washington was that his instruments had failed causing him to stray off course. Supposedly only half the film capsules ejected by the *Discoverer* satellites were ever recovered. The CIA would have us believe that the *Glomar*, after retrieving only half of a sunken Soviet submarine on its first try, couldn't go back for another bite. In order not to answer embarrassing questions about South Africa and Israeli nuclear weapons, the government has been trying to discredit the report of its own *Vela* satellite, which spotted a nuclear test explosion near South Africa last year. And, despite all the spy-in-the-sky gadgetry, they tell us they can't figure out where South Africa gets its oil.

Of course, there are political reasons for reporting so many "failures." A government like ours, which likes to be able to denounce other countries' violations of international law, doesn't want to acknowledge publicly that it commonly violates the air and offshore territory of other nations for espionage purposes. Since the U.S. has aided the development of Israeli and South African nuclear arsenals, and helps keep those countries supplied with oil, the government has a stake in keeping the evidence secret. The revelation by the Center for National Security Studies that the CIA used satellites for surveillance of the anti-war movement in the U.S. was obviously an embarrassment to the Agency.

The official reason for the reluctance to disclose more about these exotic sources and methods of intelligence gathering is that it will tell America's enemies how the U.S. gets its information, and will allow them to take countermeasures. (Despite this claim, it is well-known in the CIA that a secret can't be kept from a determined opponent for very long. William K. Harvey, the CIA's legendary James Bond figure, posted a sign in the Berlin tunnel where it crossed beneath the East-West border, "You Are Entering the American Sector," in wry anticipation of the day that the East Germans and Russians would discover his giant wiretapping operation.)

*(Continued from page 23)*

It is easy to see why the government and the military want to keep the wraps on the new technological developments. These are the "force multipliers" which make it possible to fight a modern war, even a nuclear war, with a fraction of the personnel formerly required. The new jargon is C³I, which stands for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence. These are the four elements essential for victory in any war.

There are, however, much more important domestic political reasons for keeping these new techniques secret. If the public ever becomes keenly aware that the CIA reads people's mail without opening the envelopes, that wiretapping is so automated that computers differentiate voices and topics of conversation and transcribe only those of interest to the eavesdroppers, that spy ships can tell what a city manufactures by listening to its industrial and transportation noises, and that the combination of high-resolution optics, spectrozonal photography, image motion compensation, and electronic image enhancement permit satellite surveillance day and night, even penetrating clouds, not just civil libertarians would be raising questions. Some of the government's expensive proposals might be subjected to strong challenge.

The most obvious conclusion would be that the U.S.S.R. cannot be far behind in developing similar technologies, and, if true, this would absolutely demolish the underlying assumption of the MX missile—the most expensive boondoggle ever foisted upon the American people. If a combination of optical, radio, radiological, seismic, and biological detectors can unerringly determine, as they certainly can, which of the number of siting points is "loaded" with a live missile, and which are either empty or fitted with dummies, the whole rationale for the system becomes unglued. That, however, would shift the public back to a focus on effective disarmament proposals, the thing our militarists fear the most.
