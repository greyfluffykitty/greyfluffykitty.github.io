## CAQ CovertAction Quarterly: Winter 1996-97

### Letters to the Editor

**Whose AIDS Conspiracy?**
Demonstrating the falseness of minority-accepted theories that government-created and disseminated infectious agents cause AIDS, David Gilbert's "AIDs: Conspiracy or Unnatural Disaster" (CAQ #58) urges acceptance instead of official AIDS doctrine. He asserts that it is an infectious disease caused by HIV ("AIDS-HIV") best combated by clean needles, safe sex, and early treatment. But his article glosses over the major role of chemicals, including street-drugs, rather than infection, in causing AIDS and its deaths.

Heroin and cocaine were known to destroy the immune system long before AIDS. Malnutrition, chronic disease, antibiotics, blood transfusions and a host of chemicals cause similar destruction. Official HIV propa-ganda hides how malnutrition and chronic local illnesses — malaria, parasites — cause African "AIDS," half of whose victims are women - as opposed to 10 percent here: the fraction of female drug users.

My article, "Is AIDS Non-Infectious?" (CAQ #28, 1987) focused on the work of Berkeley professor Peter Duesberg, the leading critic of official doctrine. This prize-winning retrovirus investigator pointed out that these organisms as a class are too weak to cause human illness. Continuing to question official doctrine, he and other scientists have emphasized the extent to which chemicals — street and recreational drugs, antibiotics for treating sexually transmitted diseases, and highly toxic anti-AIDS drugs such as AZT — harm the immune system, and how that system often recovers following cessation of drug use and institution of exercise, good diet, and hygiene.

Duesberg's new book, *Inventing the AIDS Virus*, was so viciously savaged in the April 7 New York Times Book Review that it publish-ed his lengthy reply. In its June issue, *Reap-praising AIDS*, the invaluable publication of the Group for Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis described, for example, the Wall Street Journal's May 1 front page account of the deliberate exaggerations — conscious lies — by the Centers for Disease Control about the heterosexual transmis-sion of AIDS, the theoretical basis for official support of "safe sex" — condom use — for youngsters.

Journalist Bob Lederer's "Origin and Spread of AIDS" (CAQ #28 and #29, 1987) is a major source of Gilbert's ideas. While this long article touched briefly on possible non-infectious causes of AIDS, Gilbert mentions neither them nor my article, which appeared in the same issue as Lederer's. This omission is additionally surprising since my article examined and demolished the Segal hy-pothesis of a synthetically created AIDS virus, on which Gilbert spends a full page.

Gilbert, like so many other honest "AIDS educators," has been conned. His support of official AIDS doctrine, while ignoring funda-mental still-unanswered questions about it, leads to his endorsing "safe sex" and the ad-ministration of dangerously toxic, but not ac-cepted, drugs to clinically healthy HIV seropositive people. In so doing, he fails to-tally to recognize that by aiding the distribu-tion of some of those chemicals — street drugs (by the CIA) and toxic anti-AIDS medica-tions in particular — the government is ac-tually facilitating the spread of AIDS.

**What AIDS Is and Isn't**
Gilbert's article left out the two most im-portant books on the subject: *The AIDS War*, by John Lauritsen, and *Inventing the AIDS Virus*, by Peter Duesberg. Considering Gil-bert is sitting in prison, it is understandable that he does not have access to all sources, but you do and should have verified Gilbert.

"AIDS" is a phony construct of 30-year-old diseases, including TB and varieties of VD and cancer which the Centers for Disease Control calls "AIDS" if HIV, one of many viruses in our system, happens to be there. TB is always TB, no matter which of the many viruses that are always in our system happen to be there. This is not science; this is outright ly-ing by a genocidal government. Kaposi's sar-coma, a form of cancer, was on the list, but was taken off in December 1994. KS was the signature disease of "AIDS." The cancer rate is rising in our society because of the in-creased chemical and nuclear pollution in the air, water, earth, and food.

"AIDS" in Africa is mostly malnutrition and curable diseases such as cholera and VD, which became fatal among starving people. All foreign visitors are told all medical prob-lems are "AIDS" so the African people can re-ceive the charity money for hospitals, schools, etc., denied them by imperialism.

The cause of the current medical crisis called "AIDS" is a lack of a national health care system that guarantees health care from cradle to grave, in other words, social-ized medicine. It is no accident that the US has the biggest "AIDS" crisis in the industrial-ized world; we are the only industrialized country without a serious health care sys-tem. Added to that lack is a drug epidemic and its accompanying poor eating habits and unhealthy lifestyles, problems common to both the gay male community and the poor, non-gay communities. Hemophiliacs are dy-ing from hemophilia, which is fatal, al-though during the first 15 years of the "AIDS" crisis, their life expectancy increased from 12 to 27 years. If one takes AZT, a poison, one will surely die, regardless of whether one has "AIDS," hemophilia, or anything else. The gay community now knows that AZT is poison, but it was actively promoted to increase lon-gevity just a few years ago.

It is a shame that an excellent magazine like yours published such a backward article. I look forward to a discussion of the research of Dr. Peter Duesberg and John Lauritsen.

**Lee Heller**
*San Francisco*

**David Gilbert Replies:**
My article very explicitly stated that it makes no attempt to solve the origins of AIDS and does not even review the range of theo-ries. I analyzed just one set of beliefs, and only because of its dire public health and po-litical implications.

Dr. Nathaniel Lehrman and Lee Heller's position that HIV is not a cause of AIDS stands in contradiction to the view I examined that HIV was deliberately engineered as a weapon of genocide. What these two opposite, wrong theories have in common is the dangerous practical result of deprecating prevention programs.

Lehrman and Heller are certainly right in emphasizing the importance of such is-sues as street drugs, malnutrition, the lack of guaranteed health care, and chronic dis-eases. But this valid point is hardly a cri-tique of my article, which was all about how "AIDS and other epidemics and health haz-ards flow most easily along the contours of social oppression," and which concluded by stressing "mutually reinforcing (social and health) crises." It is true that official doctrine has downplayed the possible co-factors with HIV (Drs. John Sonnabend, Luc Montagnier, and Shyh-Ching Lo are credible researchers in this area). Where I emphatically part com-pany with Lehrman and Heller is in their promotion of Professor Peter Duesberg's the-ory that HIV is not a cause of AIDS, a position totally rejected by the overwhelming major-ity of scientists in the field.

The non-HIV theories were still plausible in 1987 when CAQ ran Lehrman's article. Now, there is compelling evidence for blood borne transmission and for HIV as a primary agent:
• There are AIDS patients (such as the wives of hemophiliacs) with HIV but without the deleterious lifestyle and environmental factors that Lehrman and Heller stress.
• In 1995, two different laboratories discov-ered the internal "epic war" raging be-tween proliferating HIV and the body's effort to replace lost T-4 cells.
• Researchers have recently found people who, despite all the lifestyle and transmis-sion risks, did not get AIDS due to a rare genetic resistance to HIV.
• Studies published this year show a very high correlation between the level of HIV in the blood and the speed of the onset of AIDS. The correlation with the level of HIV is even stronger than with the T-4 cell count.

Lehrman charges me with "endorsing" toxic drugs (such as AZT) and more generally with "support" for government policy. My ar-ticle never discusses such treatments, and the heart of my essay is a scathing indict-ment of "official criminal negligence." More importantly, in dismissing the transmission of HIV through unprotected sex and shared needles, Lehrman and Heller undercut the AIDS prevention efforts so urgently needed to save lives.

Thanks to CAQ for publishing Lehrman's position in 1987 and for printing my piece which, while devoid of sensational charges about origins, exposes today's deadly failures around prevention and public health.

**Bob Lederer Corrects the Record:**
Congratulations to CAQ and David Gil-bert for his article which mirrors my own con-clusion. Since writing three articles in *Covert Action* a decade ago on theories of human-made AIDS (deliberate and accidental), I've watched many of those theories — and newer ones — come and go. None has stood the test of time. As David explains, there are several reasons to reject any theory based on genetic engi-neering. And the evidence for the various non-splice theories has simply not come in.

Yet from left to right, people have used my articles to support their own — often re-pressive or diversionary — agendas about AIDS. (I particularly regret giving any cre-dence to the notion, long since discredited, that insects might spread AIDS). The most re-cent example is a book by a possibly LaRouche-affiliated dentist, Leonard G. Horowitz, who takes off from my articles to weave a tangled web of CIA plots to invent and spread HIV. Posing as a progressive, Horowitz shows his hand with a fevered "exposé" of the role of Henry Kissinger and the Rockefellers in masterminding world domination.

This is not to say I support the "official" HIV-from-African-green-monkeys theory; it remains wildly implausible. And I retain an open mind about whether HIV actually causes AIDS. The evidence appears strong, but ques-tions remain. One question which does not remain is that posed (in the same *Summer 1987 Covert Action* as my first article) by Nathaniel S. Lehrman: "Is AIDS Non-Infec-tious?" To this day, Lehrman and right-wing allied retrovirologist Peter Duesbergcontinue to contradict irrefutable epidemiology by claiming that AIDS is not a sexually- and needle-transmitted disease. Their attack on campaigns for safer sex and clean-needle use truly lifesavers is utterly irresponsible.

Meanwhile, the case for some of the co-factors (contributing causes) theorized in my 1987-88 articles especially other viruses, the bacteria that causes syphilis, the misuse of antibiotics (both under- and over-treatment) and street drugs, extreme psychological stress and nutrient deficiencies continues to grow, yet is still shamefully neglected by a dogmatic, pharmaceutically intertwined medical establishment.

Gilbert correctly located the real genocide of AIDS in "the everyday functioning of a two-tiered public health system that is rooted in racism, sexism and profiteering." He should know — he's struggled for years under highly repressive conditions in prison, at great personal risk, to build peer-educated pre-vention programs and support for inmates with HIV, often stigmatized and medically underserved.

Over the last decade, I, too, have im-mersed myself in the day-to-day fight to end this epidemic, which has now claimed the lives of 31 of my acquaintances. I remain ac-tive with ACT UP (the AIDS Coalition to Un-leash Power), a predominantly gay and lesbian nationwide direct-action movement that fights such policies as pharmaceutical price-gouging, government cutbacks in medical care access, and Clinton's refusal to fund needle-exchange programs. I also serve on the board of a "buyers club" that distrib-utes low-cost vitamins and herbs, plus scien-tific information on the growing evidence of their effectiveness. Finally, I'm a senior edi-tor of a national magazine, POZ, which cov-ers AIDS from practical, investigative, and inspirational angles.

I cite my activities to emphasize my con-viction that anyone who remains fixated on the past (i.e., the origins of AIDS), and is not engaged in the vital tasks of "fighting like hell for the living," should not be taken seriously. I encourage you to join the fight. Please contact: POZ, 349 W. 12th St. New York, NY 10014 email: <pozmag1@aol.com>.

## CAQ Briefs

by Terry Allen

*   The US administration armed Colombian army units guilty of atrocities and lied to Congress.
*   Drug czar McCaffrey endorsed a Peruvian strong-man implicated in drug deals and CIA spying.

### The Good Student

Russia may not have long ex-perience with the niceties of Western-style democracy, but some of its leaders are catch-ing on fast. In September, af-ter the US launched a missile attack on Iraq — supposedly to protect the Kurds, but in good part to protect a CIA operation to overthrow Sad-dam Hussein — Russian strongman Aleksandr Lebed was impressed: "This is the essence of democracy. You send in the planes and drop the bombs. Then you gather the journalists and tell them to applaud. We need to study that."

### CIA and Drugs, Our Man in Peru

In late October, while the CIA was vigorously denying com-plicity with narcotraffickers here at home, drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey traveled to Peru and met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the head of that country's National Intelli-gence Service (SIN, in its ironic Spanish initials). Mon-tesinos has links to both the CIA and international drug traffickers, as well as a his-tory of human rights abuses. McCaffrey went not to bury Montesinos but, according the Peruvian press, to praise him as an "outstanding and knowledgeable strategist." It was the first time in six years that Montesinos, the second most powerful man in Peru after President Fujimori, was seen in public. He had been forced into a shadow role because of a particularly un-savory past: While in the army during the 1970s, he was caught spying and pass-ing state secrets to the US and was convicted of deser-tion. After being released from prison, he became the lawyer-of-choice for Peru's drug kingpins, and used his army and political connec-tions to work his way back to the back rooms of power.

It is widely assumed that he maintains a relationship with both the CIA and drug traffickers. Human Rights Watch/Americas and the Washington Office on Latin America also charge him with human rights abuses: "A death squad composed of members of the SIN and military agents and organ-ized under Montesinos' di-rection has been responsible for some of the most serious rights violations attributed to the armed forces under Fujimori's administration, including disappearances, torture and illegal execu-tions."

McCaffrey's public en-dorsement of Montesinos came at a crucial time: New allegations against Peru's "Rasputin" were prompting demands for a public in-quiry. On trial for cocaine trafficking, drug lord De-metrio Chávez Peñaherr-era testified in August that he paid Montesinos $50,000 a month during 1991 for un-hampered use of a clandes-tine airstrip to export drugs to Colombia. Chávez also said Montesinos had communi-cated with him by radio at his remote hideout, had warned him when counternarcotics op-erations were scheduled for the Huallaga valley, and once attended a payoff in person. "I saw him; his group arrived in two black cars," Chávez said. "I saw how they gave him the money."

The drug lord said that he left Peru for Colombia soon after Montesinos de-manded that he double the monthly bribe to $100,000. When Chávez was finally arrested, it was not for traf-ficking, but for collaborating with terrorists. This charge pushed his case into the se-cretive military justice sys-tem, which was able to hold him in isolation, thus spur-ring complaints that the military was trying to shut him up.

When he finally appeared at the trial, Chávez dropped the bombshell kickback charges against Montesi-nos. A week later, in a barely coherent statement, Chávez recanted, saying he had been "confused." His lawyer, Pablo Castro, sus-pected that the retraction and the quick deterioration in his client's mental and physical health were the re-sult of mistreatment by SIN.

The Chávez affair is the latest in a series of drug-related incidents that have embarrassed the Peruvian government but done noth-ing to dampen US enthusi-asm and support. In one incident, more than 380 pounds of coca paste were found in a former presiden-tial plane. Soon after, more than 200 pounds were found on-board two navy ships, one in the Canadian port of Vancouver.

Officially, the police are in charge of antidrug opera-tions. In fact, it is the mili-tary that plays the key role, blending counterinsurgency and counternarcotics in a potent cocktail of corruption. Up to 300 military personnel have been investigated or charged in connection with drugs since 1990. Regional commanders overseeing clandestine airstrips alleg-edly got a $10,000 kickback per shipment of drugs loaded by soldiers under their com-mand onto Colombia-bound planes. The airstrip from which Chávez's drug cargoes were flown to Colombia was only a few kilometers from a counterinsurgency base in the upper Huallaga Valley.

In this case of military in-volvement in narcotraffick-ing, as in many others, the runway leads to Montesinos. According to Ricardo So-beron, a narcotics expert at the Andean Commission of Jurists, "He controls the military establishment for Fujimori."

McCaffrey's visit to bestow Washington's seal of approval on Fujimori and Montesinos was preceded by US praise for Peru's human rights re-cord and by a personal let-ter to Fujimori from Pres. Clinton, praising Peru's ad-mirable progress in the war on drugs. While the two top Peruvians basked in McCaf-frey and Clinton's warm approval, some Peruvian of-ficials suggest that US leni-ency reflects the fact that Montesinos may still be on the US payroll.

Meanwhile, CIA Director John Deutch continues to deny US complicity in narco-trafficking.

### Funding Drug Dealers and Human Rights Abusers

That same confusion of the role of the police with that of the military, and of counter-insurgency with counter-narcotic strategies, has per-vaded US policy in Colombia, where some 20,000 civilians have been killed since 1986. According to Amnesty Inter-national (AI) and the mili-tary's own paper trail, US aid allocated for counternar-cotics has been diverted to fund counter-insurgency and used by units implicated in human rights abuses.

On August 18, 1991, for example, members of the XIII Brigade, tasked with counterinsurgency, burst into the home of political ac-tivist Antonio Palacios Ur-rea, murdered him and three of his children, and tortured other family members. US military documents, leaked to AI via journalist Frank Smyth, confirm that coun-ternarcotics funding was go-ing to this unit. US Defense Department (DoD) docu-ments confirmed that all but one of the brigades that AI implicated in gross hu-man rights violations turned out to have received US aid. The paper trail also shows that the Clinton administra-tion knew of the violations and repeatedly told Congress and the public that it was not funding and arming units implicated in atrocities.

The administration insists that US aid funds anti-drug not counterinsurgency efforts, but US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) documents reveal that attempts to separate the two operations are farci-cal. Col Warren D. Hall staff judge advocate to Gen. Barry McCaffrey (then SOUTHCOM commander and now Clinton's drug czar) admitted as much in an in-ternal memo: "It is unrealis-tic to expect the military to limit use of the equipment to operations against narco-traffickers.... The light in-fantry skills US special operations forces teach dur-ing counterdrug deploy-ments... can be used by the Colombian armed forces in their counterinsurgency as well." Hall also admitted that US-supplied equipment "may be used in counter-insurgency operations dur-ing which human rights vio-lations might occur."

SOUTHCOM worried about being "vulnerable to criti-cism because of the similari-ties inherent in counter-drug [CD] and counter-insurgency [CI] efforts in Colombia." But since "disengaging from the CD effort in Colombia is not a viable option," a DoD memo noted, "... USSOUTH-COM must adhere to policies that minimize the possibil-ity of US culpability for hu-man rights violations" — as opposed to minimizing the violations themselves.

In 1996, Congress banned aid to any military unit about which there is credible evi-dence of human rights viola-tions. Since DoD admits that those violations will likely continue, and since confu-sion between CI and CD roles is unavoidable, we can look forward to an immediate cessation of aid to Colom-bia. Or not.

### Familyvalues Bobdole and the Myth of the Liberal Media

It is probably true, as conser-vatives charge, that more re-porters are Democrats than Republicans; it is also largely irrelevant. And the usual jump — that US media have a liberal agenda — is just plain silly. First, the current Democratic party is so far from liberalism that it makes Richard Nixon look pink around the edges. But more importantly, the political per-spective of individual report-ers is a relatively unimportant factor in the final shakedown of what events are covered and how. In the same way that choices about what kind of cars Ford produces are made in the board room, rather than on the factory floor, decisions about what goes on the air and into print are made by publishers and editors, not by lowly hacks or even lofty anchors.

A case in point: During much of the stupifyingly dull campaign, one juicy story was an open secret among reporters. From 1968 to 1970, Bob Dole had an affair with Meredith Roberts while he was married to his first wife. *Time* and the *Washing-ton Post* knew about it and concluded, at the highest lev-els, that the adultery was not newsworthy. The Dole campaign, which had been frenetically drum beating the senator's integrity to the point of universal mi-graine, was in a cold sweat lest the news break: Dole's communications director, John Buckley, paid a little visit to *Time's* Managing Edi-tor Walter Isaacson to argue against publishing the story; meanwhile Dole press sec-retary Nelson Warfield and adviser Mari Will sat down with top Post editors to re-quest they sit on the story. After Elizabeth Dole called Post publisher Donald E. Graham to plead her hus-band's case, Graham said that he had merely notified the paper's executive editor, Leonard Downie Jr., of the call. Even after the *National Enquirer* broke the story, the *Post* and *Time* held it until after the election.

Downie later explained that the scandal had not met his longtime standard for newsworthiness. "The fact that it was 28 years ago — played a role, and also it did not involve in any way his use of public office," he said. Andrew Rosenthal, Washington editor of the *New York Times*, joined the corporate chorus: "This was a story about an alleged af-fair that happened 30 years ago. Big deal."

He has a point, but nei-ther Downie's "standards" nor Rosenthal's dismissal ruled during the 1992 elec-tion when the media em-phasized Clinton's 1969 use of marijuana, his avoidance of the draft, and his 1969 student visit to Moscow.

The point is not that the corporate media favored one candidate over the other — both were acceptable to big business — but that the poli-tics of reporters pales before the power of management.

## The Poverty Profiteers Privatize Welfare

by Mark Dunlea

“This is one of the biggest corporate grabs in history," charges Sandy Felder, public sector co-ordinator for SEIU, a union representing public employees. She is referring to the aftermath of the welfare "reform" passed by the 104th Congress. While the bipartisan coalition that pushed through the legislation raked political hay by scapegoating the poor, the job-less, single mothers, and children, cor-porations preferred their profits in cold cash. They understand that one conse-quence of the downsizing of "big govern-ment" is the upsizing of big corporations.

The privatization of welfare-related social services now underway will mean a massive handoff from government to the private sector. According to an in-dustry survey, 49 states have already privatized some welfare functions and many are considering further outsourc-ing. "Obviously, [firms] are not going into it with altruistic motives and the intent of losing money. The profit mo-tive is foremost," said John Hirschi, a state legislator in Texas, where the first major contract is on the block. The cor-porations believe Texas "will be a model for the rest of the country," said Bruce Bower, a lawyer who specializes in wel-fare issues at the Texas Legal Services Center. "They're licking their chops."

And the feast they are anticipating is tempting indeed. The recent federal legislation mandating block grants to states to replace the welfare system is the biggest overhaul of a federal pro-gram since the New Deal. Up for grabs is much of the $28 billion a year that governments now spend nationwide to distribute $250 billion to welfare recipi-ents. With welfare comprising 6-30 percent of state budgets, the changes will be radical. The new legislation, in addition to opening the door to corpo-rate profiteers, will by conservative estimate — push an additional 1.5 mil-lion adults and 1.1 million children into poverty. Most of the children affected live in families with a working parent.

It will also offer unprecedented oppor-tunities for corporate profitmaking as ma-jor firms engage in high-stakes bidding for the potentially lucrative contracts. One of the most aggressive is Lockheed Martin, the $30 billion defense contractor which made billions selling weapons to the very "big government" it is now trying to sup-plant. Ironically, although Lockheed has little experience in the social services, it does know welfare from the inside. In the 1970s and '80s, Congress approved a mas-sive bailout for the failing weapons manu-facturer. Also trying to win contracts are: Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the $12.4 billion information-technology company founded by presidential candidate Ross Perot; Andersen Consulting, a $4.2 bil-lion sister company of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm; Unisys; and IBM.

### Gatekeepers and Revolving Doors

One strategy the corporations are using to gain an inside edge is to aggressively recruit federal and state welfare offi-cials, especially from states where con-tracts are up for bid. In October, the Texas State Employees Union asked for an investigation of eight high-ranking state officials who took jobs with com-panies bidding for the state's contract.

Another man who stepped through the revolving door is Gerald Miller, former director of Michigan's welfare program. As Lockheed's new head of "welfare in-itiatives" division, he quickly predicted that "[t]he private sector will ulti-mately run these programs, the era of big government is over."

The initial areas of welfare privati-zation are child support collections and job placements. Lockheed already has more than 200 state and municipal cli-ents. It collects delinquent child sup-port payments in 30 states and gets about 19 cents from the government for each of the $1.15 billion it recovers an-nually. The new law expands the op-portunities for business by allowing states to: contract out the administra-tion of the block grants program (now renamed Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF); contract with charitable, religious, or private or-ganizations to provide TANF services; and contract out the administration of child care funds. Private companies are also seeking to take over eligibility and benefit determinations, thus becoming the new gatekeepers to welfare services.

Many politicians around the country are eager to cooperate. While elected of-ficials at all levels of government have long called for the overhaul of the sys-tem, the reality is that few are willing to get involved in the day-to-day details of moving low-income households which often present a wide range of eco-nomic, educational, and social chal-lenges — from welfare into jobs. Nor are they eager to take the consequences for failure. When Congress transferred responsibility for the design and opera-tion of these welfare programs, it also imposed financial penalties for states that fail to meet such targets as the number of welfare participants en-gaged in "work" activities. An attractive solution for local politicians is to pass the buck by awarding a low-bid contract and letting private industry worry about making the system work.

### Or Toll Booth Operators

This handover of sensitive social issues to corporations is raising concerns. "As companies like Lockheed adjust to the end of the Cold War," said union spokes-person Sandy Felder, "they're looking around to see where they can grab some extra money. You really need the individuals who are making decisions about who re-ceives government benefits to be held accountable to the taxpayers, not to some private company whose main concern is its profit margin. A public employee is more likely to be concerned about mov-ing a welfare partici-pant into a long-term employment situ-ation, because that will save the most tax dollars in the long run. A worker for a private company is going to focus on how to get individuals off welfare in the shortest time, no matter what hap-pens to them later, since that is what increases their company's profits and keeps the worker employed."

If profits increase when companies reduce caseloads, they will have a high incentive to deny or terminate assis-tance. "It's the same problem we are seeing with health maintenance or-ganizations," said Henry Freedman, executive director of the Center on So-cial Welfare Policy and Law.

"While the com-panies contend they can save money through increased efficiency, they can also do it by reducing services, which is easier. We need to examine how the contracts are structured, so that profits are tied to increases to long-term employment. Unfortunately, it's usually simpler to measure perform-ance by reduction in caseloads."

"Traditionally," even under public ad-ministration, which has less incentive to deny benefits, "many low-income indi-viduals have had a difficult time obtain-ing the public benefits they are entitled to," said Rachel Leon, who works for the Hunger Action Network, a statewide anti-hunger organization in New York.

"Legal aid attorneys and advocates constantly plead with, cajole, and sue state and local officials to force compliance. When these services are contracted out to a private agency, not only is there another layer of bureaucracy to contend with, but for-profit companies have no experience with anti-poverty law or negotiations. I don't look for-ward to arguing on behalf of a client in front of a hearing officer on Lock-heed's payroll."

Involving private companies also threatens to further erode client pri-vacy. "The welfare system asks far more personal questions than the average American would tolerate," stated Ron Deutsch, associate director of the State-wide Emergency Network for Social and Economic Security, an economic justice organization based in New York State. Once collected, the information "can also be used in paternity suits, abuse and neglect cases, and custody cases. The more entities that have ac-cess to this data, the more difficult it is to ensure confidentiality."

Another area of potential abuse is-the increased possibility of political cor-ruption; lucrative contracts often attract patronage, kickbacks, and bribes. It was such corruption scandals earlier in the century that led efforts to professional-ize the public workers in the 1920s, ena-bling them to perform services that were previously contracted out.

Those who favor the transfer con-tend that benefits will outweigh prob-lems since privatization saves money by bringing cost-cutting and efficiency and allows government to take advan-tage of innovations and expertise devel-oped by the private sector. Critics counter that savings are often illusory or short-term, with costs rising after the private companies have established themselves. And once they get in, ar-gues Freedman, "a lot of these private companies will have a stranglehold. When a public agency doesn't perform, you improve the training or replace the people who aren't performing. At least you already own the hardware and in-frastructure. It will be much more diffi-cult for the government to start from scratch if the private company walks away with everything when their con-tract is terminated."

And finally, those adding up the ad-vantages of privatization fail to factor in related costs such as contract prepa-ration, administration, and monitoring as well as the frequent free use of gov-ernment facilities, equipment, and ma-terials. They also completely ignore long-term social costs such as reduced salaries for workers and smaller staffs.

### Plague of Privatization

Welfare "reform" is only the latest mani-festation of a major trend toward the pri-vatization of formerly public functions. Elected officials of both major parties are rushing to out-source everything from social se-curity, to trash collection, to dispens-ing fines for delinquent parking tickets, to fire, ambulance, and po-licing services. Private prisons now house almost 80,000 people.

This drive to privatize gained politi-cal currency as "big government" re-placed big corporations as public enemy number one. The US has always had strong populist movements, but histori-cally they targeted the powers of robber barons and corporations. However, one of the legacies of Barry Goldwater's failed presidential election — besides paving the way for Ronald Reagan — was to en-able conservatives to redirect anger away from corporations and onto government. With ever-increasing corporate owner-ship of the media, it may be a long time before corporations replace government as the focus of populist enmity.

Big business, which has benefited mightily from the shrinking of govern-ment, has not been a passive bystander. Unlike welfare moms, corporations have the resources to lobby legislators and to feed the campaign coffers that are the way to many a politician's vote. The pattern of their buying influence and shaping legislation is well docu-mented. A few years ago, for example, an advocate on welfare issues for the Hunger Action Network of New York state was startled when she ran into lobbyists for Shea & Gould at the state legislature. The powerful New York law firm was pushing for the expansion of fingerprinting of welfare participants. Previously, the fine details of welfare policy had only attracted the interest of government officials and a few under-paid and overworked advocates. Even the utility companies, landlords, and su-permarkets that receive almost all of the welfare payments seldom paid much attention to the annual fight over benefit levels. Why then was one of the highest priced law firms in the state suddenly involved? Shea & Gould was representing one of the companies in-terested in the "fingerimaging technol-ogy" designed to prevent fraud — even though there was no documented evi-dence that there was a problem with in-dividuals using multiple identities to cheat the system. (The welfare system already had one of the most rigorous ap-plication and documentation processes of any government benefit program.) The manufacturer had invested in the lobbyists with the expectation that once welfare participants had been used as the guinea pigs to develop a statewide system, fingerimaging technology could be sold for wider commercial ap-plications, such as hotel rooms, car rent-als, and automated teller machines.

### Pain in the Gluteus Maximus

Maximus Inc., one of the largest private company's involved in running wel-fare systems, is represented by two major PR firms well-known for lobby-ing in state capitals and in Washing-ton: the Jefferson Group and Wexler Group. With $100 million in various government consulting contracts, Maxi-mus has welfare-related contracts with a dozen states and the District of Colum-bia, including a $10 million contract in California to recruit Medicaid recipi-ents into HMOs and $7 million in job placement contracts in Boston; Fairfax, Virginia; and two California counties.

The company has had a history of problems with its contracts. In West Virginia, Kenneth Roberts, a former project director at the Department of Health and Human Services, was jailed in 1996 for illegal activities involving Maximus' bid on a child welfare services contract. Maximus lost the contract to Lockheed. In 1993 in Arizona, after child support workers charged that Maximus had made data entry errors, the state had to return $250,000 in incorrectly as-sessed child support pay-ments. In Nebraska, in June 1995, following a dispute over the company's fees and a debate over privatization, the state legislature terminated its contract.

Maximus also takes advantage of the revolving door. Its founder and president, David V. Mastran, served as acting direc-tor of research for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under Presidents Nixon and Ford. Several other company officials have strong gov-ernmental backgrounds, including John A. Svahn, its former chair, who worked for Ronald Reagan for more than 18 years. He was instrumental in securing Maximus' first big welfare contract from Los Angeles County in the late 1980s.

### America Works, Not

America Works, another major player, specializes in job placement and related services for welfare participants. It bills itself as the "first private company dedi-cated to the public cause of putting peo-ple to work." Founded in 1984, it lost several of its contracts in Buffalo and Ohio in its early years after complaints about excess costs. The company, which now receives generally positive media coverage, focuses on finding entry-level positions such as reception-ist, secretary, mail-room clerk, word processor, cashier, security, or ware-house worker. A typical annual salary is supposed to range from $15,500 to $18,000. Advocacy and watchdog groups have accused it of working only with people who require little more than help polishing their résumés and job leads while summarily weeding out those in most need. For example, a worker who has a family emergency and fails to comply with an attendance policy — far stricter than in most workplaces — is typically kicked out of the program.

America Works receives fees from two sources. It charges the welfare agency approximately $5,000 for each client, and it keeps a significant portion of the salary its clients earn during their first four months on the job. Dur-ing this time, while monitoring per-formance, America Works reaps $6-9 an hour from the employer, which pays the trainee minimum wage. It further boosts profits by collecting various gov-ernment incentives and tax credits for hiring welfare participants. Because of a three-stage funding contract, New York state has paid America Works more than $1 million for people who never found jobs and for placements that never became permanent.

### Non-Profits Join the Feeding Frenzy

Non-profit organizations are also lining up for a piece of the welfare pie. United Way, one of the country's oldest philan-thropies, is playing a key role in Mayor Giuliani's plans to privatize much of New York City's welfare system. Since 1993, it has been under contract to the city's welfare agency to provide data on a wide range of social, health care, and neighborhood issues. In 1995, United Way completed a quarter-million dollar study on how the city could privatize in-come support centers where people ap-ply for benefits and meet with caseworkers. The plan, based on the HMO model, would base payment to agencies on the number of people they got off public assistance.

In late 1995, after United Way of New York state joined with the Busi-ness Council and several large human service agencies to endorse a welfare re-form plan, many advocacy organiza-tions accused it of supporting measures that would hurt many of its member agencies and their clients. After public employee unions threatened to boycott payroll deduction programs, the char-ity was forced to back off from support-ing the scheme — which called for cuts in benefits and a four-year time limit on welfare. At the time, United Way was desperate for new sources of money. Following a 1992 scandal involving its national president, donations had dropped by $8 million in NYC alone.

Nor are non-profits immune from the temptations of patronage and graft. Earlier this year, NYC signed a $43 mil-lion deal with the Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee to su-pervise Home Relief recipients and try to move them off welfare. The FBI in-vestigated the committee after learning that it had submitted the highest bid and had several well-connected former city employees on its payroll. After the pub-licity, the mayor canceled the contract. The city also terminated a $3.4 million welfare contract with United Way when the city comptroller charged that it should have gone to the lowest bidder.

### Workfare or Slave Labor?

As the clock ticks, states are scrambling to put people to work — any work. Un-der the new law, 25 percent of adults must be in a "work" program by August 1997; within five years the quota rises to 50 percent. With about 10 million Americans out of work, no money in the welfare legislation allocated to job crea-tion, and a system that does not even aspire to full employment, welfare par-ticipants are far more likely to end up in these workfare positions than in a real job. In these publicly subsidized jobs (New York, for example, puts up $3,500 a year for each slot), former welfare re-cipients perform low-level, dead end la-bor, "working off their welfare and food stamp checks for the minimum wage or less. They do not qualify for unemploy-ment and Social Security and lack the grievance and organizing rights of other workers.

Previously, federal law limited work-fare to public sector or non-profit posi-tions that provided community service. New York City, for example, replaced many parks department employees with workfare participants and is now looking for slots in the subway system. Now, the new law removes the commu-nity service restriction. Facing the fed-erally imposed deadline, states and cities are increasingly looking to the private sector, both to accept workfare participants and to participate in wage subsidy and on-the-job training pro-grams. Workfare participants can now be placed in fast food restaurants, home health care agencies, and janitorial services. President Clinton is also pushing for expansion of wage subsidy programs for welfare participants.

So far, workfare's rate of success in moving people into real employment is not good; it is about 8 percent in New York state. The program is rapidly cre-ating a large subclass of workers with subminimum wages and poor working conditions. It is also pitting desperate former welfare clients against other low paid workers in a job market which can-not sustain them both.

Meanwhile, corporations are rush-ing in to bid on newly privatized serv-ices and profit from the misery. They are unlikely to be disappointed by any lack of entrepreneurial opportunity. "The new welfare law has many corpo-rate welfare provisions. The changes open up new markets for companies to sell their services, while providing a pool of free labor. As the government moves to restrict welfare for poor peo-ple, they're expanding it for the corpo-rations," stated Cecilia Perry, public policy analyst for AFSCME. The dangers are substantial. Despite the ineffi-ciency and opaque bureaucracies that mark most government-run programs, they provide mechanisms for account-ability and public input; they also weigh the public good when designing and assessing success. The private sec-tor, on the other hand, looks only to the bottom line.

## The New Age of Surveillance

### Exposing the Global Surveillance System

by Nicky Hager

In the late 1980s, in a decision it probably regrets, the US prompted New Zealand to join a new and highly secret global intelligence system. Hager's investigation into it and his discovery of the ECHELON Dictionary has revealed one of the world's biggest, most closely held intelligence projects. The system allows spy agencies to monitor most of the world's telephone, e-mail, and telex communications.

For 40 years, New Zealand's largest intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) — the nation's equivalent of the US National Security Agency (NSA) — had been helping its Western allies to spy on countries throughout the Pacific region, without the knowledge of the New Zealand pub-lic or many of its highest elected offi-cials. What the NSA did not know is that by the late 1980s, various intelligence staff had decided these activities had been too secret for too long, and were providing me with interviews and docu-ments exposing New Zealand's intelli-gence activities. Eventually, more than 50 people who work or have worked in intelligence and related fields agreed to be interviewed.

The activities they described made it possible to document, from the South Pacific, some alliance-wide systems and projects which have been kept se-cret elsewhere. Of these, by far the most important is ECHELON.

Designed and coordinated by NSA, the ECHELON system is used to intercept ordinary e-mail, fax, telex, and tele-phone communications carried over the world's telecommunications networks. Unlike many of the electronic spy sys-tems developed during the Cold War, ECHELON is designed primarily for non-military targets: governments, organi-zations, businesses, and individuals in virtually every country. It potentially affects every person communicating be-tween (and sometimes within) coun-tries anywhere in the world.

It is, of course, not a new idea that intelligence organizations tap into e-mail and other public telecommunica-tions networks. What was new in the material leaked by the New Zealand in-telligence staff was precise information on where the spying is done, how the system works, its capabilities and shortcomings, and many details such as the codenames.

The ECHELON system is not designed to eavesdrop on a particular individ-ual's e-mail or fax link. Rather, the sys-tem works by indiscriminately intercepting very large quantities of communications and using computers to identify and extract messages of in-terest from the mass of unwanted ones. A chain of secret interception facilities has been established around the world to tap into all the major components of the international telecommunications networks. Some monitor communica-tions satellites, others land-based com-munications networks, and others radio communications. ECHELON links together all these facilities, providing the US and its allies with the ability to intercept a large proportion of the com-munications on the planet.

The computers at each station in the ECHELON network automatically search through the millions of messages inter-cepted for ones containing pre-pro-grammed keywords. Keywords include all the names, localities, subjects, and so on that might be mentioned. Every word of every message intercepted at each sta-tion gets automatically searched whether or not a specific telephone num-ber or e-mail address is on the list.

The thousands of simultaneous mes-sages are read in "real time" as they pour into the station, hour after hour, day after day, as the computer finds intelligence nee-dles in telecommunications haystacks.

### Someone Is Listening

The computers in stations around the globe are known, within the network, as the ECHELON Dictionaries. Computers that can automatically search through traffic for keywords have existed since at least the 1970s, but the ECHELON system was de-signed by NSA to interconnect all these computers and allow the stations to func-tion as components of an integrated whole. The NSA and GCSB are bound to-gether under the five-nation UKUSA sig-nals intelligence agreement. The other three partners — all with equally obscure names — are the Government Communi-cations Headquarters (GCHQ) in Britain, the Communications Security Estab-lishment (CSE) in Canada, and the Defense Signals Directorate (DSD) in Australia.

### NSA's Business Plan: "Global Access"

by Duncan Campbell

Nicky Hager's research has confirmed news reports from eight years ago: The NSA had begun ECHELON and designed it to provide immediate access to all the world's communications networks, with computers scanning what was intercepted, catching those communications mentioning subjects or parties of interest to intelligence analysts and their customers, and passing them on. The information Hager gathered with his own eyes, and with the help of insider sources, sheds light on where NSA is heading in the 21st century.

In Britain three years ago, peace campaigners at the Menwith Hill Station in Yorkshire obtained a huge haul of NSA documents. Among them, the valedictory dispatch to NSA staff from the outgoing director of NSA, Adm. William Studeman. With startling clarity, Studeman confessed his anxieties about NSA's future. He testified to the organiza-tion's inner fears as the end of the Cold War swept away much of the agency's previous raison d'etre. He warned:

"Budget cuts and NSA's relative piece of the intelligence resource pie will likely diminish. Target technology will be tough, and many outsiders will want to rationalize a reduced threat dimension in order to further decrement intelligence for alternative agendas.... We must plan and act out ahead of our targets and our business contem-poraries..... Our efforts must be focused on important payoff projects. Marginal business must be killed off."

Studeman explained how to do this: "NSA must con-stantly demonstrate its operational and technical prowess to deliver in all business areas. The military account is basic to NSA as a defense agency and lack of utter faithful-ness to this fact will court decline. At the same time the de-mands for increased global access are growing." According to Studeman, two factors stood out above all others in NSA's plan to protect its turf in the 21st century — "global access" and "SMO" (support for military operations).

These are the "twin pillars" of NSA's future. *Secret Power* reveals that global access has arrived. When we talk or e-mail across international frontiers, we are not alone.

Their suit alleges that the conduct by the US of intelligence surveillance operations against European citizens in Europe is a breach of the European convention on human rights.

### Greenpeace Warrior: Why No Warning?

by N.H. (Nicky Hager)

In spite of all the official rhetoric about intelligence sharing, New Zealand's allies have not always been forthcom-ing. On July 10, 1985, a bomb ripped through the hull of the boat used by the Greenpeace environmental group. The act of terrorism sank the ship and killed Fernando Pereira, a Dutch pho-tographer. The Rainbow Warrior was docked in Auckland, NZ, in preparation for a voyage to the French nuclear testing area at Moruroa in the South Pacific.

In February 1985, while the GCSB received up-to-the-minute reports on the Iran-Iraq war, Soviet troops in Af-ghanistan, and screeds of information on international terrorism — nothing came from the UKUSA intelligence agencies on the French agents who were then en route to New Zealand to blow up the activists'ship.

The lack of intelligence warning about the first act of ter-rorism on New Zealand's soil is surprising. Either the mas-sive UKUSA intelligence system actually gathered no information or, as was suggested in news stories at the time, the US and British intelligence authorities may have with-held some information to punish New Zealand for its nu-clear-free stand earlier that year. Either way, "not one scrap of intelligence" came from the UKUSA, according to intelli-gence staff.

In the case of New Zealand and Australia, I found that the intelligence agencies have been so secret and insulated from democratic oversight that they frequently pursue pri-vate policies completely at odds to the publicly stated poli-cies of their governments. There are many examples of governments simply not being told about important opera-tions and developments.

### "Communication" Through Satellites

The next component of the ECHELON system intercepts a range of satellite communications not carried by Intelsat. In addition to the UKUSA stations tar-geting Intelsat satellites, there are an-other five or more stations homing in on Russian and other regional communi-cations satellites. These stations are Menwith Hill in northern England; Shoal Bay, outside Darwin in northern Australia (which targets Indonesian satellites); Leitrim, just south of Ottawa in Canada (which appears to in-tercept Latin American satellites); Bad Aibling in Germany; and Misawa in northern Japan.

A group of facilities that tap directly into land-based telecommunications systems is the final element of the ECHE-LON system. Besides satellite and radio, the other main method of transmitting large quantities of public, business, and government communications is a com-bination of water cables under the oceans and microwave networks over land. Heavy cables, laid across seabeds between countries, account for much of the world's international communica-tions. After they come out of the water and join land-based microwave net-works they are very vulnerable to inter-ception. The microwave networks are made up of chains of microwave towers relaying messages from hilltop to hill-top (always in line of sight) across the countryside. These networks shunt large quantities of communications across a country. Interception of them gives access to international undersea communications (once they surface) and to international communication trunk lines across continents. They are also an obvious target for large-scale in-terception of domestic communications.

Because the facilities required to in-tercept radio and satellite communica-tions use large aerials and dishes that are difficult to hide for too long, that network is reasonably well docu-mented. But all that is required to in-tercept land-based communication net-works is a building situated along the microwave route or a hidden cable run-ning underground from the legitimate network into some anonymous build-ing, possibly far removed. Although it sounds technically very difficult, micro-wave interception from space by United States spy satellites also occurs. The worldwide network of facilities to inter-cept these communications is largely un-documented, and because New Zealand's GCSB does not participate in this type of interception, my inside sources could not help either.

### No One Is Safe From a Microwave

A 1994 exposé of the Canadian UKUSA agency, Spyworld, co-authored by one of its former staff, Mike Frost, gave the first insights into how a lot of foreign micro-wave interception is done. It described UKUSA "embassy collection" operations, where sophisticated receiv-ers and processors are secretly trans-ported to their countries' overseas embassies in diplo-matic bags and used to moni-tor various communications in foreign capitals.

Since most countries' mi-crowave networks converge on the capital city, embassy buildings can be an ideal site. Protected by diplomatic privilege, they allow interception in the heart of the target country. The Cana-dian embassy collection was requested by the NSA to fill gaps in the American and British embassy collection opera-tions, which were still occurring in many capitals around the world when Frost left the CSE in 1990. Separate sources in Australia have revealed that the DSD also engages in embassy col-lection. On the territory of UKUSA na-tions, the interception of land-based telecommunications appears to be done at special secret intelligence facilities. The US, UK, and Canada are geo-graphically well placed to intercept the large amounts of the world's communica-tions that cross their territories.

The only public reference to the Dic-tionary system anywhere in the world was in relation to one of these facilities, run by the GCHQ in central London. In 1991, a former British GCHQ official spoke anonymously to Granada Televi-sion's World in Action about the agency's abuses of power. He told the program about an anonymous red brick building at 8 Palmer Street where GCHQ secretly intercepts every telex which passes into, out of, or through London, feeding them into powerful computers with a program known as "Dictionary." The operation, he explained, is staffed by carefully vetted British Telecom people: "It's nothing to do with national secu-rity. It's because it's not legal to take every single telex. And they take every-thing: the embassies, all the business deals, even the birthday greetings, they take everything. They feed it into the Dictionary." What the documentary did not reveal is that Dictionary is not just a British system; it is UKUSA-wide.

Similarly, British researcher Dun-can Campbell has described how the US Menwith Hill station in Britain taps directly into the British Telecom micro-wave network, which has actually been designed with several major microwave links converging on an isolated tower connected underground into the station.

The NSA Menwith Hill station, with 22 satellite terminals and more than 4.9 acres of buildings, is undoubtedly the largest and most powerful in the UKUSA network. Located in northern England, several thousand kilometers from the Persian Gulf, it was awarded the NSA's "Station of the Year" prize for 1991 after its role in the Gulf War. Men-with Hill assists in the interception of microwave communications in another way as well, by serving as a ground sta-tion for US electronic spy satellites. These intercept microwave trunk lines and short range communications such as military radios and walkie talkies. Other ground stations where the satel-lites' information is fed into the global network are Pine Gap, run by the CIA near Alice Springs in central Australia and the Bad Aibling station in Ger-many. Among them, the various sta-tions and operations making up the ECHELON network tap into all the main components of the world's telecommu-nications networks. All of them, includ-ing a separate network of stations that intercepts long distance radio commu-nications, have their own Dictionary computers connected into ECHELON.

In the early 1990s, opponents of the Menwith Hill station obtained large quantities of internal documents from the facility. Among the papers was a ref-erence to an NSA computer system called Platform. The integration of all the UKUSA station computers into ECHELON probably occurred with the introduc-tion of this system in the early 1980s. James Bamford wrote at that time about a new worldwide NSA computer network codenamed Platform "which will tie together 52 separate computer systems used throughout the world. Fo-cal point, or 'host environment,' for the massive network will be the NSA head-quarters at Fort Meade. Among those included in Platform will be the British SIGINT organization, GCHQ."

### NZ's PM Kept in the Dark

"In the mid-1980s, we bucked the system ... [and became] aware that we were part of an international intelligence organization which had its roots in a dif-ferent world order and which could command compliance from us while with-holding from us the benefits of others'intelligence.

"Life at the time was full of unpleasant surprises. State-sponsored terrorism was a crime against humanity as long as it wasn't being practiced by the allies, when it was studiously ignored. But it was not until I read this book that I had any idea that we had been committed to an international integrated electronic network.

Nicky Hager has long been a pain in the establishment's neck. Unfortunately for the establishment, he is engaging, thorough, unthreatening, with a danger-ously ingenuous appearance, and an astonishing number of people have told him things that I, as Prime Minister in charge of the intelligence services, was never told.

"There are also many things with which I am familiar. I couldn't tell him which was which. Nor can I tell you. But it is an outrage that I and other ministers were told so little, and this raises the question of to whom those concerned saw them-selves ultimately answerable."

— David Lange, from the foreword to Hager, op. cit.

### Looking in the Dictionary

The Dictionary computers are con-nected via highly encrypted UKUSA com-munications that link back to computer data bases in the five agency headquar-ters. This is where all the intercepted messages selected by the Dictionaries end up. Each morning the specially "indoctrinated" signals intelligence analysts in Washington, Ottawa, Chel-tenham, Canberra, and Wellington log on at their computer terminals and en-ter the Dictionary system. After keying in their security passwords, they reach a directory that lists the different cate-gories of intercept available in the data bases, each with a four-digit code. For instance, 1911 might be Japanese diplo-matic cables from Latin America (han-dled by the Canadian CSE), 3848 might be political communications from and about Nigeria, and 8182 might be any messages about distribution of encryp-tion technology.

They select their subject category, get a "search result" showing how many messages have been caught in the ECHE-LON net on that subject, and then the day's work begins. Analysts scroll through screen after screen of inter-cepted faxes, e-mail messages, etc. and, whenever a message appears worth re-porting on, they select it from the rest to work on. If it is not in English, it is translated and then written into the standard format of intelligence reports produced anywhere within the UKUSA network — either in entirety as a "re-port," or as a summary or "gist."

### Information Control

A highly organized system has been de-veloped to control what is being searched for by each station and who can have access to it. This is at the heart of ECHELON operations and works as follows.

The individual station's Dictionary computers do not simply have a long list of keywords to search for. And they do not send all the information into some huge database that participating agen-cies can dip into as they wish. It is much more controlled.

The search lists are organized into the same categories, referred to by the four digit numbers. Each agency de-cides its own categories according to its responsibilities for producing intelli-gence for the network. For GCSB, this means South Pacific governments, Japanese diplomatic, Russian Antarc-tic activities, and so on.

The agency then works out about 10 to 50 keywords for selection in each category. The keywords include such things as names of people, ships, or-ganizations, country names, and sub-ject names. They also include the known telex and fax numbers and In-ternet addresses of any individuals, businesses, organizations, and govern-ment offices that are targets. These are generally written as part of the mes-sage text and so are easily recognized by the Dictionary computers.

The agencies also specify combina-tions of keywords to help sift out com-munications of interest. For example, they might search for diplomatic cables containing both the words "Santiago" and "aid," or cables cóntaining the word "Santiago" but not "consul" (to avoid the masses of routine consular communica-tions). It is these sets of words and num-bers (and combinations), under a particular category, that get placed in the Dictionary computers. (Staff in the five agencies called Dictionary Manag-ers enter and update the keyword search lists for each agency.)

The whole system, devised by the NSA, has been adopted completely by the other agencies. The Dictionary com-puters search through all the incoming messages and, whenever they encoun-ter one with any of the agencies' key-words, they select it. At the same time, the computer automatically notes tech-nical details such as the time and place of interception on the piece of intercept so that analysts reading it, in which-ever agency it is going to, know where it came from, and what it is. Finally, the computer writes the four-digit code (for the category with the keywords in that message) at the bottom of the message's text. This is important. It means that when all the intercepted messages end up together in the database at one of the agency headquarters, the messages on a particular subject can be located again. Later, when the analyst using the Dictionary system selects the four-digit code for the category he or she wants, the computer simply searches through all the messages in the data-base for the ones which have been tagged with that number.

This system is very effective for con-trolling which agencies can get what from the global network because each agency only gets the intelligence out of the ECHELON system from its own num-bers. It does not have any access to the raw intelligence coming out of the sys-tem to the other agencies. For example, although most of the GCSB's intelligence production is primarily to serve the UKUSA alliance, New Zealand does not have access to the whole ECHELON net-work. The access it does have is strictly controlled. A New Zealand intelligence officer explained: "The agencies can all apply for numbers on each other's Dic-tionaries. The hardest to deal with are the Americans. [There are] more hoops to jump through, unless it is in their interest, in which case they'll do it for you."

There is only one agency which, by virtue of its size and role within the alli-ance, will have access to the full poten-tial of the ECHELON system — the agency that set it up. What is the sys-tem used for? Anyone lis-tening to official "discus-sion" of intelligence could be forgiven for thinking that, since the end of the Cold War, the key targets of the massive UKUSA in-telligence machine are terrorism, weapons pro-liferation, and economic intelligence. The idea that economic intelli-gence has become very important, in particular, has been care-fully cultivated by intelligence agencies intent on preserving their post-Cold War budgets. It has become an article of faith in much discussion of intelligence. However, I have found no evidence that these are now the primary concerns of organizations such as NSA.

### Quicker Intelligence, Same Mission

A different story emerges after examin-ing very detailed information I have been given about the intelligence New Zealand collects for the UKUSA allies and detailed descriptions of what is in the yards-deep intelligence reports New Zealand receives from its four al-lies each week. There is quite a lot of in-telligence collected about potential terrorists, and there is quite a lot of eco-nomic intelligence, notably intensive monitoring of all the countries partici-pating in GATT negotiations. But by far, the main priorities of the intelligence alliance continue to be political and military intelligence to assist the larger allies to pursue their interests around the world. Anyone and anything the particular governments are concerned about can become a target.

With capabilities so secret and so powerful, almost anything goes. For ex-ample, in June 1992, a group of current "highly placed intelligence operatives" from the British GCHQ spoke to the Lon-don *Observer*: "We feel we can no longer remain silent regarding that which we regard to be gross malpractice and neg-ligence within the establishment in which we operate." They gave as exam-ples GCHQ interception of three charita-ble organizations, including Amnesty International and Christian Aid. As the *Observer* reported: "At any time GCHQ is able to home in on their communica-tions for a routine target request," the GCHQ source said. In the case of phone taps the procedure is known as Mantis. With telexes it is called Mayfly. By key-ing in a code relating to Third World aid, the source was able to demonstrate telex "fixes" on the three organizations. "It is then possible to key in a trigger word which enables us to home in on the telex communications whenever that word appears," he said. "And we can read a pre-determined number of characters either side of the keyword." Without ac-tually naming it, this was a fairly pre-cise description of how the ECHELON Dictionary system works. Again, what was not revealed in the publicity was that this is a UKUSA-wide system. The design of ECHELON means that the in-terception of these organizations could have occurred anywhere in the net-work, at any station where the GCHQ had requested that the four-digit code covering Third World aid be placed.

Note that these GCHQ officers men-tioned that the system was being used for telephone calls. In New Zealand, ECHELON is used only to intercept writ-ten communications: fax, e-mail, and telex. The reason, according to intelli-gence staff, is that the agency does not have the staff to analyze large quanti-ties of telephone conversations.

Mike Frost's exposé of Canadian "embassy collection" operations de-scribed the NSA computers they used, called Oratory, that can "listen" to tele-phone calls and recognize when key-words are spoken. Just as we can recog-nize words spoken in all the different tones and accents we encounter, so too, according to Frost, can these comput-ers. Telephone calls containing key-words are automatically extracted from the masses of other calls and recorded digitally on magnetic tapes for analysts back at agency headquarters. However, high volume voice recognition comput-ers will be technically difficult to per-fect, and my New Zealand-based sources could not confirm that this ca-pability exists. But, if or when it is per-fected, the implications would be immense. It would mean that the UKUSA agencies could use machines to search through all the international telephone calls in the world, in the same way that they do written mes-sages. Ifthis equipment exists for use in embassy collection, it will presumably be used in all the stations throughout the ECHELON network. It is yet to be con-firmed how extensively telephone com-munications are being targeted by the ECHELON stations for the other agencies.

The easiest pickings for the ECHELON system are the individuals, organiza-tions, and governments that do not use encryption. In New Zealand's area, for example, it has proved especially useful against already vulnerable South Pacific nations which do not use any coding, even for government communications (all these communications of New Zea-land's neighbors are supplied, un-screened, to its UKUSA allies). As a result of the revelations in my book, there is currently a project under way in the Pacific to promote and supply publicly available encryption software to vulnerable organizations such as de-mocracy movements in countries with repressive governments. This is one practical way of curbing illegitimate uses of the ECHELON capabilities.

One final comment. All the newspa-pers, commentators, and "well placed sources" told the public that New Zea-land was cut off from US intelligence in the mid-1980s. That was entirely un-true. The intelligence supply to New Zealand did not stop, and instead, the decade since has been a period of in-creased integration of New Zealand into the US system. Virtually every-thing — the equipment, manuals, ways of operating, jargon, codes, and so on, used in the GCSB continues to be imported entirely from the larger allies (in practice, usually the NSA). As with the Australian and Canadian agencies, most of the priorities continue to come from the US, too.

The main thing that protects these agencies from change is their secrecy. On the day my book arrived in the book shops, without prior public-ity, there was an all-day meet-ing of the intelligence bureau-crats in the prime minister's department trying to decide if they could prevent it from being distributed. They even-tually concluded, sensibly, that the political costs were too high. It is understandable that they were so agitated.

Throughout my research, I have faced official denials or governments refusing to comment on publicity about intelligence activities. Given the pervasive atmosphere of se-crecy and stonewalling, it is always hard for the public to judge what is fact, what is speculation, and what is para-noia. Thus, in uncovering New Zea-land's role in the NSA-led alliance, my aim was to provide so much detail about the operations — the technical systems, the daily work of individual staff mem-bers, and even the rooms in which they work inside intelligence facilities — that readers could feel confident that they were getting close to the truth. I hope the information leaked by intelli-gence staff in New Zealand about UKUSA and its systems such as ECHELON will help lead to change.

### Inside the US-Canada Spyworld: Second Thoughts from the Second Oldest Profession

by Mike Frost

I was a spy. For almost two decades, I spied for Canada and the US on domestic and foreign soil. My employer was Canada's Communications Security Estab-lishment (CSE), the most secret and least known branch of National Defense. But although my paycheck came from the Canadian government, more often than not, my orders, assignments, and much of my training — like those of many other CSE operators—came from the National Security Agency (NSA) in Fort Meade, Maryland.

Over the 12 years I spied for CSE, it came increasingly to resem-ble the NSA. Both specialize in providing secure communications and signals intelligence (SIGINT); both oper-ated for years with little public knowl-edge or legislative oversight until they were exposed by the media. CSE, which grew out of Canada's World War II es-pionage service, operated until 1975 as the Communications Branch of the Na-tional Research Council and hid behind a facade of scientific research. In 1975, when its existence and real purpose were exposed by a CBC-TV documentary, an embarrassed government shifted it to the Defense Department and adopted the current name. Now, whatever gov-ernment is in power can more easily raise the flag of national security to shield CSE from public and media scru-tiny. The existence of NSA and the ex-tent of its operations were only revealed in 1982 by investigative journalist James Bamford.

### When the US Says "Jump..."

Despite the similarities, CSE is treated more like a subsidiary than an equal partner. US military and economic clout, as well as NSA's vastly superior technical capabilities and near unlimited funds, allow Washington to dominate. And while CSE has only 1,000 employees and a $200-300 million budget, NSA em-ploys 20,000 and has an estimated an-nual budget of almost $4 billion.

But the relationship is not without mutual benefits. CSE, NSA, and Brit-ain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) use each other's facilities and personnel to spy on friend and foe alike and, more alarmingly, to circumvent domestic laws and spy on their own populations.

### Overt and Covert Functions

CSE's current functions, according to senior parliamentary analyst Phillip Rosen, are twofold: It "provides govern-ment institutions with advice and guid-ance on the security of their electronic communications; this part is largely de-fensive and uncontroversial," implying — somewhat inaccurately, it turns out — that the agency makes sure that gov-ernment communications are not inter-cepted by hostile countries.

Its second function is "more intrusive and controversial": CSE's authority to "intercept and process foreign communi-cations between Canada and other coun-tries... has the potential for violating the rights and freedoms of Canadians."

In addition to these acknowledged roles, CSE has at times been given a mandate by the Canadian Depart-ments of Justice and Foreign Affairs, and possibly others, without Parlia-mentary approval or scrutiny, to bend and even break Canadian and interna-tional law and to violate standards of democratic accountability. I either par-ticipated in or had direct knowledge of operations in which CSE operated alone or joined with NSA or GCHQ to:
*   intercept communications in other countries from the confines of Cana-dian embassies around the world with the knowledge of the ambassador;
*   aid politicians, political parties, or factions in an allied country to gain partisan advantage;
*   spy on its allies;
*   spy on its own citizens; and
*   perform "favors" that helped its allies evade domestic laws against spying.

### Embassy Ops

Since 1972, in operations I participated in, CSE has used Canadian embassies to spy on the USSR, Romania, Venezuela, India, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Italy, Costa Rica, and others. As recently as 1995, and after I left, CSE ran an operation in Ja-pan. The information gathered is not only used in Canada, but is routinely shared with NSA and GCHQ. The program prob-ably would have remained somewhat low key had it not been for pressure put on the Canadian government by the NSA or the cooperation of Britain's GCHQ.

The operation began in earnest in the early 1980s under the codename, "Pro-ject Pilgrim," as President Ronald Reagan cranked up the Cold War. His NSA direc-tor, Bobby Inman, insisted that CSE initiate extensive operations to use embassies around the world as bases of operations for agents and sites for sophisticated sur-veillance equipment.

Although the Canadian Justice Department ruled that there was a "hint of ille-gality" to this type of spy operation, after renewed NSA pressure, Canada ac-ceded to US requests.

The stick the US raised was that if Canada failed to cooperate, it would be cut off from the lifeblood of any in-telligence system — the flow of information from the far more extensive US spy network.

The US held out carrots as well. And while these could include perks, train-ing, and equipment, the most juicy reward was still information. For example, CIA and NSA each has its own satellite which can be rapidly moved from its "parking spot" over the equator to wherever needed. "Talent" and "Key-hole" are not small spheres, but what amounts to space stations half the size of a football field, equipped with highly sensitive listening devices and super cameras that can read a license plate from outer space. Since each reposition-ing uses up precious fuel and shortens the satellite's useful life span — usu-ally six months or so — it is an expen-sive way to gather intelligence. For Canada, the promise of tapping into this resource and occasionally being able to direct its use was irresistible.

NSA not only nudged CSE into an extensive embassy collection program, it taught us how to do it at Fort Meade and more extensively at its "Special Collections Service" (SCS) headquarters at College Park, Maryland. I was one of two men asked by CSE in 1977 to initi-ate these embassy collection operations and for the next 12 years was one of the main coordinators of Canada's espionage opera-tions abroad. By the time I was pressured to retire in 1990, there were about 30 Canadians involved. Through-out it all, I was trained and controlled by US intelligence which told us what to do and how and when to do it. Each and every operation abroad by every CSE operator involved in Project Pilgrim was preceded by a trip to College Park to receive advice, training and, yes, approval. The Col-lege Park operation, the Special Collec-tions Service, was approved at the highest level of the US government. Al-though the top job at SCS alternated between NSA and CIA, in fact, NSA ran the show with orders coming directly from the White House.

I look back on the "Pilgrim" operations in which I participated — in New Delhi, Moscow, Rabat, Caracas, Abidjan, and Bucharest, to name a few — with mixed feeling. Despite serious ques-tions about the role of covert operations in a democratic society, I am proud of some. The surveillance we conductedon members of the hated Ceausescu re-gime in Romania, for example, may have accomplished some good. Intelli-gence we obtained clearly showed that the dictator was not popular with the ministers in his own cabinet, who dis-agreed, almost unanimously, with his policies. While it is impossible to know if this intelligence was used by the US, Brit-ain, and Canada to provoke Ceausescu's dramatic fall in 1989, it is clear that the information was available to do just that.

### Spying on Our Own

Other activities by CSE, NSA, and GCHQ were more blatantly problematic, and since my separation from CSE I have been increasingly troubled by the fact that these agen-cies spied on their own citi-zens. During the Cold War and probably continuing to the present day — Canada routinely bought "third party" intercepts, some of which targeted members of Canada's democratic opposi-tion movements. Located close to the USSR, the Scandi-navian countries had a blan-ket mandate to intercept Soviet communications which they then sold to CSE by the boxload. Starting in the 1960s, CSE asked the Norwe-gians — and probably the Swedes and Danes — to in-tercept communications be-tween France and Québec.

Tension had been high be-tween Paris and Ottawa since 1967 when President Charles de Gaulle threw his support behind the Québec inde-pendence movement. In a dra-matic feature, he mounted the balcony of Montreal City Hall and declaimed "Vive le Québec libre." In 1976, as a referendum on separatism loomed, the Canadian govern-ment, headed by a strongly anti-separatist Pierre Trudeau, used every means at its dis-posal, including espionage, to defeat it. Ottawa was par-ticularly concerned that the government of Giscard d'Estaing — known to be privately sympathetic to the separatist cause — was sur-reptitiously aiding the sepa-ratists. It was hoped that Scandinavian intercepts of all communications be-tween France and Québec would reveal any collaboration.

CSE also monitored communica-tions between France and Québec from a "Pilgrim" listening post in West Africa using "Oratory," a key-word selection computer; the name of Québécois leader Rene Lévesque was on the list of flagged words, and so, too, to the delight of NSA, was that of PLO leader Yasir Arafat.

Technically, CSE was intercepting French communications, but in fact, we were spying on our own citizens. The tar-gets were, in fact, Québecers — like Lévesque — who were democratically elected and engaged in a constitution-ally protected struggle to determine the shape of Canadian democracy.

With the question of independence for Québec still unsettled, CSE prob-ably still maintains a "French Problem" section at its headquarters which, as in the past, deals solely with the question of separatism.

**Image**: *TERRY ALLEN - Arafat has good reason to look over his shoulder, but it was the NSA that should have been smiling after CSE used its monitoring posts to gather information on him and the PLO for the Americans.*

### Spying on Our Allies

In addition to surveilling its citizens, Canada has spied on allies, including Ja-pan, Mexico, Costa Rica, India, France, Italy, and the US. Meanwhile, the US has long used its embassy in Canada to surveil the Canadians. NSA couldn't ask for a more ideal intercept site. The US embassy sits in front of Parliament and offers an unobstructed view of the prime minister's and the privy council's offices. On its flat roof, directly above rooms with barred, curtained windows, are "air vents" and "heat pumps" tradi-tionally used to conceal antennas and other intercept equipment. The official response to my October 1994 allega-tions that they housed surveillance equipment and that the US was using its embassy for snooping was: "Too ab-surd to comment on." The setup, how-ever, is almost exactly like known embassy operations in other countries. According to NSA expert Wayne Mad-sen, "It is highly probable that listening devices at the American Embassy on Wellington Street [in Ottawa] can hear conversations inside the prime minis-ter's Centre Block office, and in the cabinet room, too."

### Special Collection's Stupid Pet Tricks

Although I visited NSA headquarters at Fort Meade dozens of times, it was at the Special Collection Serv-ice (SCS) at College Park, Maryland, that I received my covert operation training and assignments. This facility, set in suburban Washington, DC, dealt exclusively with cov-ert intercept operations. The first time I was driven there in 1978, I entered through a strip mall and then through a door in the back of a restaurant; the second time, via a dry cleaners. These dinky businesses in a fake shopping center were all owned, operated, and staffed by US espionage agencies. From the street, the installation's high-tech capacity, its antennae and satellite receptors, were camouflaged and it is unlikely that neighbors suspected anything out of the ordinary.

But the inside was anything but ordinary. There were scores of rooms crammed with administrative functions, equipment, wires, jury-rigged gizmos, a currency bank, and computers. Every electronic intercept capability NSA denied having was right there. In a small blackbox, not much bigger than a brief-case, was "Oratory." This portable key-word selection com-puter could be taken almost anywhere and set to pick out pre-selected words and automatically monitor and record fax, voice, or teletype messages that contained them. Developed by NSA, "Oratory" was "tempest-proof'(i.e., shielded to pre-vent emissions that could lead to detection), small, virtually indestructible, and easy to repair: all you had to do was open the lid and replace the self-diagnosed defective component.

Also inside the building was the office of the head of SCS. I was probably the first Canadian treated to an explanation of his "trophy rack," prominently displayed behind his desk. One item which caught my interest was a stuffed pigeon en-shrined as if it were King Tut. The head of SCS explained: "Well, there was a 'target' [in Washington, DC].... We just couldn't get close enough to plant a bug; it was the Soviet Em-bassy; it was an island site surrounded by a fence and pro-tected by a huge perimeter. On the top floor was one specific office we desperately wanted to bug. For all the great equip-ment we had, there seemed to be no way to do it.... We scouted it. We took pictures. Then one day, while we were looking at the photographs of the office window, one of our guys noticed that there were pigeons sitting on the window ledge. We guessed they were nesting beneath the eaves. One of the en-gineers came up with a brilliant solution: 'Why don't we bug a pigeon?' At first we just laughed. But the more we thought about it, the more we figured maybe this wasn't such a bad idea."

NSA finally trapped some of the birds, operated — insert-ing a small "bug" into the pigeons' chests, with a tiny antenna running down one of the wings — and released them. "It was summertime, and the window was left open most of the time. We got incredibly good results." After the job was done, NSA rewarded the birds' service. "I decided to have one stuffed to keep as a memento," remarked the chief.

Near the bird was a three-foot long tree branch. In fact, it was a fiberglass replica holding wires and circuit boards. "What was this used for?" I asked. "Well," responded the chief, "we couldn't get inside the Chinese Embassy in DC to plant a bug, but we noticed the ambassador would sit on the same garden bench every morn-ing and have long conversations with his staff and high-ranking visitors. There was a tree close to the bench and our engineers came up with the idea of making a fake tree branch, putting a bug in it, and then dropping it near the garden bench." They planted the branch on a windy day and it worked until a gardener cleaned it and put it in the trash, where it was retrieved.

The shelves held other testaments to that bizarre combi-nation that marks much of intelligence work: a boyish exuber-ance in putting one over and an amoral obsession with attaining an end no matter the means. There were bugged Royal Dalton porcelain roses, dried floral arrangements, and even a hollowed-out wooden icon of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus. The flashy cockiness that marked the US in-telligence service, coupled with all the high-tech gadgetry un-limited money could buy, were there at College Park. The facility was relocated closer to Fort Meade in the early 1990s.

**Image**: *SONJA ISKOV/2.MAJ//IMPACT VISUALS - While many armies use pigeons, NSA's head of Special Collections showed a singular lack of gratitude for services rendered. After the bird completed its mission, he had it killed, stuffed, and put in his trophy case.*

### Back Scratching and Gamesmanship

This kind of spying is all part of the game and is tolerated among allies and even enemies so long as it does not cross some mutually understood line. And where that line is drawn is much de-pendent on what can be gotten away with. In pursuit of plausible deniability, CSE, GCHQ, and NSA have used each others' personnel and resources to evade laws against domestic spying. In 1975, with Watergate fresh in the minds of Americans, NSA was more re-luctant than usual to overstep legal boundaries. Members of its "A Group," which dealt with East Bloc counter-es-pionage, were in need of a favor. They asked my section head for help tracking down HF (high frequency) burst trans-missions originating in Maryland and ending up in Moscow. NSA suspected espionage, but since the probable per-petrator was a US citizen using his own house, they were reluctant to mount an aggressive intercept. And if anything went wrong, they wanted to be able to deny involvement. NSA did, however, volunteer to foot the bill for CSE per-sonnel and provide all the equipment.

CSE, in turn, protected its own deni-ability by giving the job to two communi-cations experts at the Canadian Forces intercept base in Leitrim, near Ottawa. The men were sent to NSA for a detailed briefing and given clearance by the Ca-nadian military to go ahead. It was to be a one time thing: get in, get out, and NSA will be grateful. CSE was aware but not involved; it didn't cost us any money, the men got good training, and we built up a favor. Besides, we'd cov-ered our ass since we could just blame the military if some-thing went wrong. So two Canadians were sent to con-duct a counter-es-pionage operation on US soil at US taxpayer expense so that NSA could maintain deniabil-ity. While NSA even-tually established the suspect as the source of the burst transmissions (al-though I never found out what happened to him), in every way that counts, NSA broke US law and spied on its own citi-zens.

### UK Evades Domestic Laws

In February 1983, the British Senior Liaison Officer (BRLO) asked CSE to mount a special two-week operation in London, to be paid for by the Brits. My CSE boss, head of special collections section, described the request to me: "Well," he said, "Margaret Thatcher [then prime minis-ter] thinks two of the minis-ters in her cabinet are not 'on side' — so she wants to find out if they are.... So GCHQ asked if we were given the frequen-cies to look for, and the time frame to do the intercept, we could assist [Thatcher] in her intelligence gathering on her own ministers."

The section head went on to explain that GCHQ was in a tight spot. It wanted to aid Thatcher — who had just shuf-fled her cabinet and was planning a June election — but the operation was risky. If, however, "we do it," the section head continued, "they can safely say they didn't, if anyone asks." In part to return favors and build up good will, in part to test out some new equipment, and in part for the perk of two weeks all-expenses paid in London, CSE agreed. The risk for us was minimal. Who was going to catch us? The guys who did the catching were the ones who were asking us to do it.

Using the frequency provided by BRLO, the section head set up an intercept using the briefcase-sized receiver developed by the US-based Microtel Corp. Under cover of a "technical visit," he based the operation inside Macdonald House, the Canadian High Commission, and also used his hotel room. The tapes of con-versations by the targeted ministers were duly handed over to GCHQ in its Cotswold headquarters.

At the time, I never stopped to ques-tion that what we were doing amounted to performing dirty tricks for a partisan politician, for her very personal rea-sons, in a foreign land. We had listened so routinely to private conversations we weren't supposed to hear, that I guess we had become immune to that kind of soul searching. And after all, we weren't spying on Canadians — that time anyway.

### Spying on You, No One Is Exempt

Increasingly though, both because it's possible and because it's desired, indi-viduals are caught in the broad net of electronic surveillance. The experts can record and analyze all your communica-tions at will. SIGINT organizations in Canada, US, UK, Australia, and NZ use supercomputers such as the Cray to se-lect items of interest. The list is very fluid and is adapted rapidly to monitor people and policy areas. At any time, it is likely to contain names of all world leaders, terrorists, drug lords, mafia dons, members of radical groups, labor union activists and leaders, types of weaponry, explosives, financial deal-ings, money transfers, airline destina-tions, stock information, international conferences, demonstrations, and po-litically suspect groups and individu-als. As is the case with operations, countries maintain deniability by get-ting information gathered on their do-mestic situations by allies. Under development is even more sophisti-cated "topic recognition" which can home in on guarded conversations that avoid potential trigger words.

Nothing and no one is exempt. For example, you are talking on the tele-phone to a friend discussing your son's school play. "Boy," you say sadly, "Bobby really bombed last night," or perhaps you used the word "assassination" or "sabotage" or any one of the many thou-sands of key words the computer has been told to flag. A hard copy of your conversation is produced, passed to the appropriate section (in this case terror-ism), and probably ends up in the gar-bage. But perhaps the conversation is not so clear-cut or the analyst has poor judgment. Then your name is perma-nently filed under "possible terrorist." Weeks or even years later, you have a similar conversation and use the same words; the computer filters it out again. Since this is the second time, your name moves from the "possible" to the "probable" file. Sound absurd? Not at all; it actually happened while I was at CSE.

According to the watchdog group Privacy International, the use of this kind of technology is spreading. "From Fort Meade, Maryland to Cheltenham, England and from Canberra, Australia to Issy les Moulineaux in Paris; signals intelligence (SIGINT) specialists are honing their skills at monitoring digital information. SIGINT agencies every-where are increasingly throwing their surveillance web over the Internet and other data networks of interest." Ac-cording to Madsen, "Advanced surveil-lance functions have become an integral part of wide-scale information systems used by governments and busi-nesses. Monitoring of the activities of individuals is seen as a desirable — and often technically essential — com-ponent in many of these systems."

### Justifying Espionage No Matter the Costs

The end of the Cold War struggle that fed the budgets and rhetoric of the intel-ligence bureaucracies has not meant the end of spying. In addition to targeting strategic threats and drug and terrorist activities, intelligence organizations are increasingly open in acknowledging economic espionage as part of their mis-sion. In February 1996, Boris Yeltsin or-dered top state officials to close the technology gap with the West by mak-ing better use of industrial intelli-gence. While Aleksandr Lebed was security chief for the Federal Security Service (formerly the KGB), he publicly urged "more spying on banks and foreign companies and want[ed] to see Russian firms used for corporate espionage."

The list of examples is growing. For-mer CSE analyst Jane Shorten re-vealed that CSE routinely monitors communications from the G-7 summits and other global conferences. At this year's G-7, the US delegation was warned that it would be the target of in-dustrial espionage. In August, security experts at the European Union's Lux-embourg offices said they had found evidence that the Americans had pene-trated, through the Internet, the elec-tronic mail that links 5,000 EU elected officials and bureaucrats. Last year the Japanese lodged a formal complaint after the CIA "listened in" on Tokyo offi-cials during sensitive auto trade nego-tiations.

After devoting most of my working life to espionage, I now ask myself if spying on our friends and neighbors is the way to acquire national security and economic prosperity. Do we sleep easier with the knowledge that our se-curity was gained through dubious methods and could be snatched away by someone with even fewer scruples or more technology? Do we tell our chil-dren it is wrong to lie, steal, and cheat unless you do it for your country and then it is no longer immoral but patriotic? The temptation is near over-whelming and the justifica-tions are legion: all countries do it, and in the short term, at least, cheating pays off as long as you don't get caught — and sometimes even if you do — as long as you are caught by other intelligence agencies and not publicly exposed.

While the countries are an-noyed when foreign embassies are used to peer into the offices of the head of state, or when the details of trade and deals are plucked from the air, they gen-erally prefer to counter such espionage quietly or even tolerate it. It is rare for friendly countries or even enemies to denounce these illegal intrusions. In-telligence agencies play by their own set of rules and understand that there are things more threatening to their ability to "play the game" unhampered than losing a round to their rivals. By and large, they know who is spying on whom, who knows what, and how. It is the public that is kept in the dark. "Se-crecy not only permits but encourages questionable operations," says Nicky Hager in his new book on electronic sur-veillance. And the biggest threat to those operations is the light of day.

## The Battle for Cyberspace

by Wayne Madsen

In the cause of protecting our precious national information infrastructure, the Pentagon — eagerly supported by military contractors — is hyping fanciful security threats from cyberspace and promoting remedies that endanger civil liberties and target movements for social change.

General "Buck" Turgidson, the -boisterous, gum-chewing gen-eral played by George C. Scott in *Dr. Strangelove*, feared that if the So-viet ambassador penetrated the Penta-gon's war room and saw the secret "Big Board," the national security of the United States would be irreparably damaged. Turgidson's real-life succes-sor — the military intelligence estab-lishment — is looking with trepidation at all the computerized big boards that monitor our electrical power grids, air traffic control systems, national tele-communications networks, and televi-sion networks. With rising voices, they are warning that a motley assortment of terrorists, hackers, foreign spies, and mafia dons is poised to gain access to our "precious national information in-frastructure." These info-warriors claim that everything from automatic teller machines, telecommunications switches, corporate proprietary data, medical systems, and the Pentagon's in-ner sanctum is lying virtually unpro-tected. Their solution is to grant the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies — particularly the ultra-secretive Na-tional Security Agency (NSA) — ever widening powers.

US intelligence has a special reason to champion information warfare. In an age of budget cuts, agencies such as the NSA, CIA, and even the FBI see cyber-space, the Internet, and other modern information channels as a future battle-ground. There, they envision informa-tion wars against nebulous bands of drug dealers, arms smugglers, terror-ists, and rival nations. And for that they will need a whole new offensive and de-fensive arsenal. Eagerly nodding their heads and holding out their hands are military contractors anxious to cash in on the lucrative contracts to develop strategies, programs, and products to engage the nation's cyber-enemies. And as is usual of a project dear to both intelligence and industry, both political parties have offered ardent support.

On July 15, President Clintonsigned Executive Order 13010 which created a Presidential Commission to recom-mend new legislation to protect the country's "critical infrastructure." One of the administration's InfoWar town criers, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, appeared the next day before the Senate's Permanent Committee on Investigations. She cautioned that un-less the US embarked on a Manhattan type project, it could suffer the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor. Gorelick pointed to a recent power failure across several western states as well as Can-ada and Mexico that could have been the result of an InfoWar attack. In fact, it was caused by nothing more nefarious than a fallen tree branch. Stressing ur-gency and stretching for examples, she told the Senate committee that "recent breakdowns of the air traffic control system — although the result of aging systems rather than electronic attacks — illustrate the potential impact of a re-gional or system-wide collapse of such a key infrastructure." Actually, the great-est protection our air traffic control sys-tem currently has is also its most significant vulnerability — the advanced age of the computer equipment. It breaks down frequently but it sure does keep out those criminal hackers.

### Information Warfare or War on Information?

These hyped-up scenarios aside, the US does face sinister information-related threats; they come not from hackers and terrorists, but from the government's use of information censorship and "per-ception management." Because of me-dia coverage, especially by CNN, during the Gulf War, Tiananmen Square, and the abortive Soviet coup, Washington's opponents in Baghdad, Beijing, and Moscow were privy to real-time infor-mation at the very moment it was avail-able to the military and intelligence leadership in Washington. A report written for the Pentagon by the large intelligence contractor, Science Appli-cations International Corp. (SAIC), warned that "Widespread dissemi-nation by the US media and its inde-pendence vastly complicate military operations. Any information warfare strategy must take into account the press and at least address its potential im-pact. It will be a key component of the information environment." (Emphasis in original.)

Vice Adm. William Studeman, former director of the NSA and ex-deputy direc-tor of the CIA, was quite specific where he thought the media fit in a future informa-tion war. Surfing on Alvin and Heidi Tof-fler's third wave, he echoed their contention that there must be a "rapid media reaction force" to pump out all sorts of propaganda on various media channels and outlets for "positive pur-poses." His definition of "positive," how-ever, might raise some eyebrows among civil libertarians:

"When it comes to the information aspects related to national security and the modern military battle-field, the media and other sources of open information are major play-ers. They populate, even clutter up the modern battlefield. They shape opinions, impressions, and percep-tions about the legitimacy, morality, and effectiveness of purpose on the battlefield. They add dynamic and encyclopedic depth to the informa-tion base associated with the mod-ern battlefield, and we use their information in support of intelli-gence analysis. They are used by the combatants for perception man-agement, propa-ganda, message sending, and other signal purposes. The information environment the media creates, im-poses, or disposes can make or break a war effort. Substantial sophisti-cated accounting must be taken for the role the media will play in the battlefield information spectrum."

The Pentagon and the intelligence institutions, then, face nothing less than a loss of their traditional monop-oly over the flow of strategic and tacti-cal information from the world's battlefields and zones of rebellion. To make matters worse, the flow of TV im-ages is supplemented by a tidal wave of information over the Internet. This broad, inexpensive access to a world audience — whether by pro-democracy students in China, anticommunist mayors in Russia, or rebel commanders in Mexico — is viewed with horror at Langley and Fort Meade. In the name of national security, the info-warriors are advocating that the government control access to uncensored and unfil-tered information from such conduits as satellite television and the Internet.

Charles Swett, an assistant for stra-tegic assessment in the Office of the As-sistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, warned of another danger: "[T]he politi-cal process is moving onto the Internet." Referring to a *Washington Post* story about the Zapatista National Liberation Front (EZLN), Swett charged that the guerril-las lied in their Internet communiqués when they claimed that the Mexican army had used tanks and aerial bombardment in Chiapas, and had raped and killed children there. He did not, how-ever, question the asser-tions of the Mexican government's Internet propaganda.

Swett also argued that the Defense Department (DoD) should begin to scan "left-wing" news on the Internet sites sup-ported by the Institute for Global Communications (IGC) and the Association for Progressive Commu-nications (APC) to keep track of activists operat-ing domestically and overseas. He added that "means of employing the In-ternet offensively in support of our uncon-ventional warfare objectives should be explored." In June, CIA Director John Deutch chimed in, lamenting that terror-ist groups were using the "Internet and other modern means for their own com-munications."

### Liberation Struggles and Terrorism

The Pentagon-NSA cyber-warriors see one of the greatest security threats com-ing from "hackers," described in a Na-tional Communications System report as "computer intruders [who] have de-veloped social philosophies... which they use to justify their electronic intrusions. One example of a philosophical posi-tion held by computer underground members revolves around the concept of freedom of information" (emphasis in the original). Computer undergrounds in Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Repub-lic, Romania, and Russia, in addition to several other countries, are cited as po-tential dangers to US National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications.

In fact, the governments most threatened by hackers are those with the most to hide, since a major goal of computer undergrounds is in getting censored information out of totalitarian regimes such as those in China, Be-larus, Iran, Nigeria, or Kenya. By re-stricting the use of strong encryption programs like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and undermining confidentiality mechanisms like anonymous re-mail-ers, Washington undermines the free-dom fighters. But it also protects its own ability to control information.

The power of an open Internet to make a difference was illustrated this September when Israel incited the Palestinians by opening a new tunnel close to the Al Aqsa Mosque. On the second day of turmoil on the West Bank, Israeli Co-bra helicopter gunships attacked houses in Ramallah while Israeli soldiers fired on fleeing students at Bir Zeit Uni-versity. When the school transmitted photo-graphs of the Israeli ac-tions around the world on the Internet, various electronic forums con-demned Israeli actions. Frustrated Israeli cen-sors said they were powerless to inter-fere with the transmissions.

In other cases, opposition groups in-cluding Hezbollah, the domestic Ira-nian political opposition forces, and Latin American progressive parties have been successfully blocked from In-ternet access. Recently, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) which was la-beled "cyber-guerrillas" by the Info-war crowd in the US and elsewhere, saw its Internet plug pulled. In 1996, during a fierce offensive against the Colombian government, the guerrillas set up a home page using an In-ternet service provider in Mexico City. FARC posted an electronic version of its maga-zine, *Resistencia*, and explained its latest actions against the Co-lombian government. Suddenly, the provider, responding to "ex-ternal" pressures, terminated FARC's connection. Based on comments and publications by opponents of an uncensored, un-regulated Internet, such "tech-nology blockades" will likely be imposed on other Internet activists.

### PSYOPing the Net

Another threat to cyberspace freedom comes from one of the more secretive and weird components of the military intelligence establishment — the PSYOP (psychological operations) people who added "perception management" to the information warfare mix. It was PSYOP agents who decided to smoke for-mer Panamanian leader Manuel Nori-ega out of the Vatican's Papal Nuncio in Panama City with obnoxious music and who counseled the paramilitary forces at David Koresh's Branch Davidian compound in Waco to demoralize the children by running over their bicycles with armored personnel carriers. They now seek to practice their government-approved mind games on the Internet and through the news media.

Among the PSYOPers, more bizarre suggestions for using the airwaves are plans to morph images of world leaders to portray them in compromising situ-ations and then beam the images by sat-ellite or airplane onto the television screens in their countries. Imagine us-ing sophisticated morphing to show Sad-dam Hussein huddled with a CIA agent or Iranian President Rafsanjani kicking up his heels at a disco, mar-tini in hand. The US Army's 4th Psychological Operations Group nearly did that. The group ad-mits that, as the Gulf War neared, it considered broadcasting directly onto Iraqi TV morphed images of Saddam sipping whiskey and carving a ham.

While this plan was vetoed, similar PSYOP broadcasts have been carried out. During the Gulf War, a special Air Force plane, codenamed Commando Solo, broadcast radio reports to Iraqi soldiers informing them that their posi-tions were the next to be attacked by al-lied aircraft; many surrendered. And before the US invasion of Haiti, Com-mando Solo broadcast messages from ex-iled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide directly onto Haitian TV.

While these operations have been run abroad, it is far from certain that the US news media would refuse to co-operate and let broadcasts be manipu-lated for political and military advantage in times of "national emer-gency" or in the interest of "national se-curity."And considering the current ownership of the media, there is reason to be concerned about how such fungi-ble terms will be interpreted. ABC and CNN are currently owned by the fan-tasy factories of Walt Disney and Time Warner (which also includes Warner Brothers), respectively. Disney and Warner Brothers have long histories of cooperating with government percep-tion management campaigns, espe-cially producing propaganda billed as entertainment during World War II.

Two of the main networks are owned by large defense contractors: NBC by General Electric, and CBS by Westing-house. Given their financial conflict of interest, they might well show sympa-thy for a Pentagon-led effort to manage the news to benefit military operations.

PSYOPers are also eagerly investi-gating the Internet as an attractive ve-hicle for offensive information warfare. The Pentagon's Swett declared: "The Internet could be used offensively as an additional medium in psychological op-erations campaigns and to help achieve unconventional warfare objectives. Used creatively as an integral asset, the Internet can facilitate many DoD op-erations and activities." Swett's work in the Pentagon's Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Opera-tions and Low-Intensity Conflict includes imple-menting battle plans.

### Viruses, Bugs, HERF Guns

Some of these "offensive" strategies under consid-eration read like B-movie scripts. In 1995, the Rand Corp. — a major think tank for the National Se-curity Council (NSC) pol-icy makers — conducted a war game, *The Day Af-ter... in Cyberspace*. In it, Iranian-backed Islamist radicals seed the world's computer systems and networks with destruc-tive software weapons, including trap doors, logic bombs, worms aided by network sniffers, traitor-ous computer program-mers, and television broadcast overrides. As a result, Cairo is blacked out; telephone switches crash in the Pacific Northwest; an Amtrak train derails near Laurel, Maryland; the Bank of England cannot transfer funds; the New York and London stock exchanges crash; automatic teller machines in Georgia go haywire; CNN goes off the air; a British airliner's cockpit goes dark, causing it to explode on landing at London's Heathrow airport; a Saudi oil refinery near Dhahran explodes; the Pentagon's logistics computers go down; and revolu-tionaries commandeer Saudi television proclaiming a "Provisional Republic of Arabia."

As if this exercise in doomsday hy-perventilation were not enough, some London banks were vulnerable to at-tacks from HERF guns and Trojan horse computer programs that could bring banking systems to their cyber knees. Some London banks reacted by trans-ferring money to Switzerland. Accord-ing to the German news weekly *Der Spiegel*, the scare story apparently was concocted by an escaped schizophrenic patient from a psychiatric clinic in Ger-many.

He may have been sent over the edge by too many Hollywood thrillers. The 1995 James Bond movie *Golden Eye* features a top secret US satellite that can generate an electro-magnetic beam anywhere on earth. In *Escape from L.A.*, released the next year, a network of "ray-gun" armed satellites orbit the earth. While there is re-search into space-based weaponry to disable en-emy electronic and com-puter systems, electrical engineer Jim Ross asserts that human-held HERF guns are simply fantasy. Given the amount of en-ergy they release, even the tiniest "leak of any power from [them] would probably cook the shooter and anyone standing near him/her." The HERF gun crowd has more suc-cess writing screenplays than formulating. na-tional security policy.

### Contracting Out Intelligence

One thing that is not Holly-wood science fiction is the current trend by the Clin-ton administration to grant more and more powers to the national intelligence establishment to control in-formation systems security in the civilian agencies of government and the pri-vate sector. In July 1996, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) warned that "Our law en-forcement and defense agencies cannot, and should not, carry the whole load for the security of our com-puter networks. Con-gress recognized this fact when it passed the Computer Security Act and put the responsibility for devel-oping federal computer security stand-ards for nonclassified information in the hands of a civilian government agency, rather than the NSA." That ci-vilian government agency is the Na-tional Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST, formerly the National Bureau of Standards). NIST, however, has lost much of its authority over secu-rity standards to the NSA.

NIST's defeat resulted primarily from the battle between the Clinton ad-ministration and its allies in the NSA and some software companies and pri-vacy advocates over US encryption standards. When private industry criti-cized NSA's role in developing the en-cryption key escrow standard (under which government escrow agents would hold parts of encryption keys), the agency cried national security. In-formation warfare, they argued, was too important to be left in the hands of a bunch of scientists, engineers, and bu-reaucrats at NIST. The Clinton admini-stration agreed and established a Joint Defense and Intelligence Community Information Warfare Technical Center, which will reside, of course, at the NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, Mary-land.

This was just the approach that Leahy had argued against when he told the Senate that "the government should not control or stand in the way of technical solutions."

The advanced technology that NSA, as information czar, would deploy to guard the parapets of the nation's com-puter infrastructure includes encryp-tion key recovery. In October 1996, after being endorsed by CIA Director John Deutch, this method of maintaining the government's ability to spy on en-crypted communications replaced key escrow as the favored technology. Key recovery works by locating information that is woven into the header of each message. This mechanism allows a re-covery "agent" to extract or "recon-struct" the message's encryption key and decrypt its contents.

Key recovery may have been the basis for NSA's most successful post-Cold War pro-ject for deciphering coded mes-sages. Since the 1940s, NSA reportedly "rigged" encryption systems sold by the Swiss firm Crypto A.G. so that the agency retained the ability to break the codes of anyone using the machines. Thus, Fort Meade was able to listen in on the coded military and diplomatic traffic of the more than 130 countries that were Crypto A.G. customers.

*Der Spiegel* recently ex-plained how the NSA program worked. Periodically, NSA and Motorola crypto-engineers would visit Crypto A.G. head-quarters in Zug, Switzerland, to install special equipment and to program cipher ma-chines. The Crypto machines encrypted messages but also inserted a secret field in the ci-pher text called "hilfsinforma-tionen" or "help information." This information was a set of instructions that allowed NSA to recon-struct the key from the message cipher text. The customer who bought the machines would not, of course, know about the special secret code. Only the NSA, German Bundes-nacrichtendienst (BND) intelligence, Crypto A.G., Motorola, or other authorized "eavesdrop-pers," with a minimum of hands-on training, would be able to automat-ically decrypt the cipher text of the mes-sage. The process sounds an awful lot like the administration's key recovery program.

### The Information Warfare Gap

At the conclusion of *Dr. Strangelove*, when nuclear missiles are about to rain down on the US, the president is told that the country has fewer mine shafts to shelter survivors than the Soviet Un-ion. Gen. Turgidson insists that the US cannot fall victim to a "mine shaft gap." The US now faces another dangerous gap — a credibility gap. An array of Pentagon, intelligence agency, and military contractor officials are trying to convince the public that its airplanes and airports, automatic teller machines and banks, hospitals, cable televisions, telephones, computers, refrigerators, and traffic lights are vulnerable to in-formation warfare attacks by an assort-ment of terrorists and Third World dictators.

While there have been security prob-lems surrounding cyberspace technol-ogy, the dangers are being grossly exaggerated by special interests pro-tecting bureaucratic turf or waiting in line to reap millions in defense con-tracts if their doomsday scenarios are taken seriously. Unfortunately, the in-vestment of scarce resources into such "pie in the sky" science fiction coun-termeasures will come at the expense of other programs. Instead of invent-ing new "threats" to national security, the intelligence establishment should be forced to divert much of its massive budget to impoverished social, environ-mental, educational, and medical pro-grams in other government departments and agencies. Information warfare should be high on any budget cutter's target list.

## Networking with Spooks

by John Dillon

The Internet is changing from a public resource to a lucrative operation influenced by spooks and former Pentagon officials. Open access and information are increasingly controlled.

The Internet, the mother of all networks, is a sprawling congre-gation of connected computers; almost anyone is welcome, almost any-thing goes. Now, one private company with strong ties to the defense and intel-ligence agencies has become the prime gatekeeper and toll-taker for the mil-lions navigating the maze. Network So-lutions Inc. (NSI) of Herndon, Va., has the government-granted monopoly to issue "domain names" — electronic addresses like <microsoft.com> used to route e-mail and steer traffic through the increasingly commercialized World Wide Web.

NSI's spook connections and its lead role in the privatization of the Internet have raised alarms. Net activists were outraged by the firm's September 1995 decision to charge $100 a year to regis-ter new addresses and $50 a year to re-new old ones. Later, NSI stirred up even more anger when it began removing the addresses of the thousands who refused to pay. The company also has been sued half a dozen times over its policy to give trademark holders priority when a do-main name is in dispute.

### Who's in Charge

The furor over NSI raises basic questions of who controls and regulates the In-ternet. Although physically decentral-ized — with millions of computers linked around the globe — the Net is in fact hi-erarchically organized. Anyone on the planet who wants an Internet address ending with one of the popular suffixes .com, .edu, .org, .net, or .gov must regis-ter the domain name with the Internet Network Information Center, or Inter-NIC, a US government-created central registry. In 1993, NSI took over the ad-ministration of that listing.

This domain name system allows people to substitute user-friendly names such as <ibm.com> for the real Internet Protocol (IP) addresses: hard-to-remember numerical strings like <198.106.242.7>. When you enter an address in your web browser — like <mediafilter.org/caq> to get this maga-zine's site — your computer first ac-cesses a "name server." The server then returns the unique numeric IP address which your browser uses to find the ap-propriate place on the Web.

Critics say there is no good reason why Network Solutions should have a monopoly franchise on registering the user-friendly domain names. But NSI has a great reason: By controlling the keys to prime Internet real estate, it has staked out a phenomenally lucra-tive business. Although the company does not release financial figures, the Internet's astronomical growth — fu-eled by the tens of thousands of busi-nesses coming on line each month — has triggered an explosion in domain name registrations. In March alone, about 45,000 names were registered, a 25 percent increase over February. NSI made an estimated $20 million in the six months from September 1995 to March 1996 from annual registration fees, with an additional $40 million pro-jected for the next six months.

"I would think they're making an ob-scene profit," said Karl Denniger, head of Macro Computer Solutions Inc., a Chicago-based Internet provider that wants to enter the domain name business. "Their mo-nopoly of this isn't really legally defen-sible," said Stanton McCandlish, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco.

### Controlling Information

NSI's national security pedigree is even more troubling to some than its monopoly-derived profits. When the government administered the Inter-NIC, the service was subsidized by tax dollars and was free to users who sim-ply registered their names. In May 1993, the National Science Foundation privatized the name registry and is pay-ing Network Solutions $5.9 million to administer it.

In September 1995, NSI instituted the fee system. A few months earlier, it had been bought out by Science Appli-cations International Corp. (SAIC). This privately held company with 20,000 employees and 450 offices around the globe has close ties to the Defense De-partment and intelligence agencies. Its current board of directors includes for-mer National Security Agency chief Bobby Inman, former Defense Secre-tary Melvin Laird, and the former head of research and development for the Pentagon, Donald Hicks. Ex-CIA Direc-tor Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense William Perry, and CIA Director John Deutch have been past members. Eighty-three percent of the company's $2 billion annual revenue comes from government contracts, including de-fense, intelligence, and law enforce-ment contracts. It is designing new information systems for the Pentagon, helping to automate the FBI's comput-erized fingerprint identification sys-tem, and last year won a $200 million contract to provide "information sup-port" to the Internal Revenue Service.

Some of these contracts, along with the company's strong intelligence and defense links, raise fears that SAIC will abuse the information it controls through its key Internet role. "I don't want a spook corporation, particularly a private spook corporation, to be anywhere near a control point on the global cooperative Internet," said James Warren, a writer and Internet civil liberties activist. But McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier Foundation described SAIC's ownership of Network Solu-tion as a "non issue." "The Internet itself was a Defense Advanced Re-search Project Agency project. It's been true for a long time. It's not some big se-cret."

### Putting A Hold on Names

Another bone of contention is NSI's pol-icy on domain name disputes. For a long time, names were registered on a first come, first served basis. But then some quick-buck artists realized they could register domain names related to fa-mous trademarks and sell the name back to the owner, a process known as trademark hijacking. In response, NSI instituted a policy that gives trademark owners priority in claiming a domain name over someone who has already registered it. While the domain names are in dispute, the company can put the disputed name "on hold," so that it can't be used until the issue is settled.

The company's dispute policy has swung too far to protect trademark owners at the expense of legitimate do-main name holders, critics say. They note that trademark law allows differ-ent companies to share the same name — McDonald's hamburgers and McDon-ald's widgets, for example. And they say NSI is ruling on legal questions, such as who owns the name and what it can be used for, without legal authority.

"They are serving as legislators, ad-ministrators, judges, juries, and execu-tioners," said Kathryn Kleiman, a lawyer and organizer of the Domain Name Rights Coalition, a non-profit or-ganization that lobbies Congress on do-main name issues.

The company's policy created major headaches for a New Mexico Internet service named Roadrunner Computer Systems, for example, which used the <roadrunner.com> address for itself and for its customers' e-mail. But last year Warner Bros., which produces Road Runner cartoons and holds a trade-mark by the same name, tried to estab-lish exclusive rights. Roadrunner Computer Systems obtained a court or-der barring Network Solutions from putting its name on hold.

### Challenging the Monopoly

But NSI's monopoly may soon crumble. Dozens of new top-level domains (the .com or .edu portion of the names) are be-ing considered, and they will be adminis-tered by new registration services.

Paul Garrin, a New York media art-ist, has plans to strike an even more de-cisive blow for competition and Internet democratization. He and his colleagues have designed an alterna-tive network of name servers. By changing your browser's default set-tings to find one of the servers Garrin has established around the world, you could locate web sites listed by any cho-sen name. The system does not yet work for e-mail.

"We would no longer be restricted to top-level domain, such as .com or .edu," Garrin said. "Under the existing sys-tem, there's an artificial shortage of do-main names driven by InterNIC's desire to control. By adding new suf-fixes such as .mag, .inc, .press, for ex-ample, numerous companies could use their own names." They could also eliminate NSI's monopoly control. "We're de-territorializing the Internet and bringing it back to the real ideal of virtual space with no national borders of hierarchies," he said.

## Patrolling the Empire: Mapping, Imagery & National Security

by Randy K. Schwartz

The Pentagon's new strategy for global control is being tested around the world from the Persian Gulf to the Huallaga Valley. A new agency, NIMA, is advancing plans for future wars by helping to fuse high tech surveillance and weaponry.

Throughout the Cold War, the two nuclear superpowers dug in across long-standing battle lines — pointed satellite sensors and other reconnaissance assets toward hard-ened military installations. The list of targets changed relatively slowly. To-day, Washington sees its security inter-ests — i.e., its ability to impose its will on a world scale — threatened not by an entrenched superpower, but by local and regional crises that erupt seem-ingly out of nowhere. In a world in which the perceived threat could be Iraqi mobile tactical missile launchers one day and rebellious peasants in the US "backyard" the next, instant, accu-rate information is crucial. As former National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Director Jeffrey K. Harris put it, "silos don't move very far once they have been dug," while "mobile missiles and guer-rillas are — no kidding — very hard to locate. And once you do locate them, they're gone in a flash and locating them again means starting all over."

So far, in the "battle for information" the US — with its superiority in satel-lite surveillance and mapping capabil-ity, along with its ability to target and rapidly deploy weapons from a safe dis-tance — is the clear winner. But if the US is to sustain military pre-eminence and achieve "battlespace dominance," it must combine surveillance and reconnais-sance with precision weaponry and with the infrastructure of command, control, communications, computer processing, and intelligence (C4I). This "system of systems" would give US war fighters ac-cess to real-time information from all sources at the touch of a button.

This October, the US military and in-telligence establishment created the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) to grapple with this new challenge and create a seamless national imagery system. The new agency absorbed the De-fense Mapping Agency (DMA), Central Imagery Office, and CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), along with the the imagery inter-pretation units of the NRO, the De-fense Airborne Reconnaissance Office, and Defense Intelligence Agency. More than 7,000 of NIMA'S 9,000 employees once constituted DMA.

As a single unified agency, NIMA will be able to exploit the entire range of im-agery collection assets, commercial processing resources, computer ar-chives, and on-line distribution channels. Where most of the 20 million maps and charts DMA produced annually were paper, NIMA anticipates that within a few years 70 percent of its images will be digital. This innovation will allow field commanders to access maps on-line, any-where in the world, instantaneously. New technology also makes it possible to fuse imagery and mapping data.

### Battle Tested

The technical and organizational retooling is dictated by new geopo-litical realities, but it draws from lessons of the past, especially those learned in the Gulf War. In that conflict, a glut of intelligence data clogged military communica-tions satellites, and because of in-compatible computer systems, satellite images processed in Washington couldn't be moved rap-idly to field commanders. Gen. Charles A. Horner, commander of US Space Command, pointed out that "air combat planning is mov-ing toward 12 hour cycles, with execution decisions and changes often made within one or two hours of time over target. Intelligence must keep pace." Creation of the Central Imagery Office (CIO) in May 1992, which worked to unify different agencies' imagery pro-cessing standards, was a prelimi-nary attempt to address the problems. Three years later, Adm. William O. Studeman, as acting CIA head, announced that the in-telligence community had "devel-oped a new framework strategy which defines for us a future world in which flexibility, adaptability, economy, efficiency, and reach rather than full-time presence, are basic elements. The requirement is to have surge, not to have total presence all around the world."

The concept of surge — the ability to pounce on a hotspot at short notice any-where in the world — is a central compo-nent of the Pentagon's new planning. It requires instant detection of security threats and the battlespace awareness to target them and strike quickly. Be-cause satellites do not require air su-premacy, they will probably remain the most reliable way to gather overhead in-telligence. A web of dozens of satellites and other spy vehicles will patrol vast stretches of the planet around the clock. Computers — which sift the deluge of real-time, as well as archived images and maps — will then be able to aim and cue weapons automatically.

The result, said one analyst, will be: "a world in which the many kinds of sensors, from satellites to ship-borne radar, from unmanned aerial vehicles to remotely planted acous-tic devices, will provide information to any military user who needs it. Thus a helicopter might launch a missile at a tank a dozen miles away based on information derived from airborne radar or satellite imagery. In this view, the revolution in military affairs consists of the United States' astounding and unprecedented abil-ity to amass and evaluate enormous quantities of information about any given battle arena... and make near-instantaneous use of it."

### Control from Outside

What are the geopolitical implications of a national imagery system? First, the US may no longer need to station forces around the world in order to enforce its will. Second, Washington can wage war from a safe distance by using imagery and other intelligence systems fused with precision weaponry.

The Gulf War demonstrated how pi-lots, with very little risk of ending up in politically troublesome body bags, could rain down death and destruction. The conflict gave a taste of the precision bombing that will be made possible by the fusion — then still in an early stage — of imagery data with smart weapons and suggested areas for improvement.

The conflict also gave the Pentagon the opportunity to battle test pilotless surveillance drones, or unmanned aer-ial vehicles (UAV). The Navy had begun pushing hard for the development of Pioneer, a 16-foot drone, after Syrian missiles downed two of its warplanes over Lebanon in 1983. The drone was jointly developed from 1985-86 by Is-raeli Aircraft Industries, Tadiran (owned by the Israeli Labor Party) and AAI Corp. (Baltimore, Maryland). Fly-ing at 15,000 feet, it can beam back im-ages to a receiver more than 100 miles away while a soldier on the ground re-motely controls bearing and camera an-gle. During the Gulf War, in 307 combat flights, the Pioneer UAV searched out Iraqi troop concentrations, artillery and missile sites, and mines, and assisted in targeting tanks, trucks, and bunkers. Marine Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Boomer called it the single most valuable collector of intelligence in the war.

Buoyed by this success, the US mili-tary is gradually replacing many of its old piloted spy planes with a fleet of drones procured by the Defense Air-borne Reconnaissance Office (DARO). Some models under development will have infrared sensors for nighttime use and the ability to detect the launch of enemy missiles — and intercept them with missiles of their own.

The Middle East has been key not only to the trials and development of UAVs, but as a testing ground for the Penta-gon's new war strategy. Since 1989, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), for exam-ple, have used Pioneer drones to secure its occupation of Palestine. The drones located mass uprisings, beamed down real-time images of riots to security forces, and patrolled border areas in search of guerrilla movements. The information they provide has made pos-sible a new form of occupation which the Rabin government dubbed "control from outside." Now, even without an IDF presence in urban areas, troops can redeploy on short notice. This capabil-ity was vividly demonstrated in Sep-tember 1996, when Tel Aviv rushed Israeli tanks and Cobra helicopters into Ramallah and other Palestinian "autonomous" areas to quell an upris-ing sparked by the Israeli tunneling near the Al-Aqsa mosque.

It was in relation to the Middle East conflict, too, that mapping expertise proved its usefulness to policy makers and the military. "It is no secret," ob-served one Palestinian, "that the map of Oslo II, with its delineation of the three zones, had been designed by the Israeli military according to a clear military plan." The Israeli-drawn maps, not shown to the Palestinians until nine days before the accord was signed, iden-tify one zone under Palestinian auton-omy, a second zone under Israeli security control with minor Palestinian administration, and a third (about 70 percent of the land) under full Israeli sovereignty. By controlling the second and third zones, and key settlements and bypass roads, Israel controls the Palestinian "autonomous" areas.

For several years, Israel has used jets, helicopters, and drones for round-the-clock surveillance of southern Lebanon, part of which it occupies. In April 1996, during Israel's "Grapes of Wrath" operation, a UN soldier in Leba-non took a video which was broadcast on BBC-TV. It showed an Israeli drone flying over the village of Qana before, during, and after the savage bombard-ment that killed 102 refugees at a UN base. An Israeli general had first claimed that a drone, sent to scout the target area, had been turned back be-cause of clouds and had left Qana well before the shelling. The video exposed this lie, and proved that the drone had helped Israel carry out a deliberate at-tack on the UN compound.

*Grapes of Wrath* drove home how quickly Israel could spring into Lebanon and sent a powerful message to Syrian President Hafez Al Assad to "get with the program" of US-brokered peace treaties. It also demonstrated that surveillance, mapping, and other assets have made it militarily feasible, for the first time, for Israel to pull its troops back and dictate a tripwire "peace" with Arab forces. The Pentagon plan for global surge capability is essentially Israel's "control from out-side" writ large.

### Deliberate Force

Assembling a national imagery system also has implications for Washington's al-lies and rivals. After the Gulf War, the Pentagon forecast that the world would continue to be punctuated by crises "likely to engender ad hoc coalitions. We should plan to maximize the value of such coali-tions." The US "information umbrella" — its increasing lead in battlespace awareness and military intelligence — is analogous to the old "nuclear um-brella." Without this capability, it would be impossible for the US to im-plement its policy of "assertive multi-lateralism" under which it pressures nations into alliance and leads interna-tional coalitions to distant lands to pound recalcitrant forces into submission.

The pacification of former Yugosla-via was a NATO operation to help make Eastern and Central Europe safe for Western, and especially US, financial and strategic interests. As early as 1994, US spy satellites and drones were urgently expanding the imagery ar-chives of the region. The drones, de-ployed in Albania, were long-range "endurance" mod-els called Predators, manufac-tured by General Atomics (San Diego). Flying at 25,000 feet, Predator's synthetic aperture radar captured live video of the Bosnian terrain at one-foot resolution— even through clouds.

The Defense Mapping Agen-cy carried out a massive effort to upgrade more than 100 different topographic maps of Bosnia. The US later distributed nearly 3 million paper and 300,000 CD-ROM versions of these color maps in support of NATO forces. The Central Imagery Office deployed local area computer networks so that field commanders wouldn't have to wait days and weeks for archived images.

In August 1995, when NATO un-leashed the air strikes of Operation De-liberate Force, US pilots led 20-plane attack groups that also included Brit-ish, French, Dutch, German, and Turk-ish pilots. "American air power was at the forefront of the NATO effort," wrote one military reporter, "with more than two-thirds of the 3,515 allied sorties be-ing flown by US Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft."

US pilots based at Aviano Air Base in Italy were at a distinct advantage. They could rehearse their individual bombing runs in virtual reality with a state-of-the-art simulator, PowerScene, from Cam-bridge Research Associates (McLean, Virginia). Before an actual run, pilots used the toggles, joysticks, and video monitors of a PowerScene workstation for lifelike practice. The software relied on an archive of DMA maps to identify cities, targets, and other features al-lowing pilots to pinpoint their coordi-nates simply by touching the screen.

"PowerScene helps us recognize the target better," crowed a US F-16 pilot who flew over Bosnia. "It gives the an-gle we'll be looking from and makes us faster at identifying targets. That can make the difference between dropping and not dropping. We come at some tar-gets at six to seven hundred miles per hour. We have seconds to identify the target or we don't drop. The bottom line is a higher percentage of our bomb runs have been successful."

Brought to the table by De-liberate Force, the key powers gathered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio. DMA set up Building 834 as a map room and began working round-the-clock. As soon as a negotiator proposed a new boundary— say the Posavina Corridor linking Serb-held areas — the change was incorpo-rated into a quickly printed map and displayed on PowerScene monitors. Within three weeks the negotiators drew new boundaries, imposed a constitution on Bosnia, and set up a government with links to the US and to Western financial institutions. Nine months later, Presi-dent Clinton was able to call for the admission of Central and Eastern Euro-pean nations to NATO by 1999.

### Remote Sensing for Counterinsurgency

There is nothing intrinsically nefarious about a collection of maps or images. They can be used to promote humane goals and policies as well as facilitate war and domination. But following a well-worn path, NIMA will undoubtedly harness seemingly innocent projects to further its goal of creating a national imagery system for the US military.

In 1992, at then-Sen. Al Gore's re-quest, the CIA began making satellite images for "environmental monitor-ing." In its new guise as nature lover, the agency formed MEDEA, a group of 60 scientists with security clearances, and asked it to advise on monitoring endan-gered Mojave Desert tortoises, Costa Rican rainforests, etc. For about a decade, the Defense Department (DoD) has been sponsoring computer projects to automate the inspection of mammo-grams for the onset of breast cancer; the same technology will be useful in auto-mating the inspection of overhead re-connaissance images.

An early example of how a seemingly benign project ended up serving a very lethal purpose was Landsat. When the image gathering program began in 1972, technicians at NASA and the other research labs who developed it were told that its goal was to use satellites to monitor crops, forest and water re-sources, survey land usage, and explore for oil and other minerals. Those scientists may be surprised to learn that the larg-est government user of the imagery was not the Department of Agriculture or Interior, but US intelligence agencies.

Landsat imagery has been widely used in US-backed counterinsurgency warfare. For more than 15 years, for ex-ample, the Peruvian armed forces have used maps based on Landsat imagery in a war against the Communist Party of Peru (PCP), also known as Shining Path. When the US Agency for Interna-tional Development (AID) funded the first accurate maps in 1975-78, it awarded a $20,000 grant to Peru's Na-tional Office for the Survey of Natural Resources (ONERN): The stated goal was to locate stands of aguaje palm, a poten-tial source of palm oil, in the rainforests on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Few roads penetrated the region and cloud cover and dangerous terrain impeded aerial surveys. The Environmental Re-search Institute of Michigan (ERIM) in Ann Arbor — which had invented the multispectral scanner technology aboard Landsat — administered the grant. ERIM and ONERN processed Landsat images into a digital map of large sections of the jungle.

Work by ERIM and others to build up Peru's mapping capabilities became more urgent after 1980, when the Shining Path launched guerrilla warfare against the US-backed regime. Under the banner of "fighting cocaine trafficking," the Be-laúnde government put much of the Amazon basin under martial law, bring-ing the army into combat against the Maoist insurgency. The US State De-partment set up and funded Peruvian "cocaine eradication units," actually counterinsurgency battalions, called CORAH and UMOPAR— the latter a spe-cial new branch of the national police.

Helicopter-based warfare against the highly mobile Shining Path required a precise knowledge of terrain and vil-lages, air and land routes. AID gave ON-ERN a $1 million grant — many times the 1975-78 level — to exploit Landsat images of Peru. By 1983, the first na-tionwide topographic map of the coun-try was completed and by 1985, CORAH alone employed 16 topographers mak-ing detailed maps of the Upper Hual-laga Valley where the guerrillas had a stronghold. ERIM had a long history of counterinsurgency support. In the 1960s, it had developed surveillance systems used by US forces in Southeast Asia to detect enemy field concentrations.

The new maps of Peru were also used for "development." AID granted $70.1 million to plan roads, bridges, power lines, and crop tests for the Upper Hual-laga Valley Development Program. De-signed to "win hearts and minds," such "development" schemes play an impor-tant role in US doctrine of "low-intensity warfare."

### Uncorking the Genie

An Air Force captain put the "hearts and minds" strategy in perspective: "To put it bluntly, our job is to break things and kill people," he said in a recent on-line debate about commercializing military production. He went on to ar-gue for the expansion of outsourcing to private contractors. "If it makes more sense to contract out certain services and/or bypass unresponsive bureaucracies to meet the mission, then I'm all for it."

The captain was endorsing a trend that has reshaped everything from wel-fare to prisons — the transfer of for-merly public functions to corporations. In military matters as well, private in-dustry's expertise and econ-omy of scale often exceed those of government. In-creasingly NIMA will rely on private firms producing items with dual civilian/mili-tary uses, such as flat panel displays and geographic in-formation systems. But ex-perts worry that in "con-tracting out" parts of the national security apparatus, the imagery system and other intelligence data might leak out of their control.

As one analyst put it: "The proliferation of high-resolu-tion satellite imaging is as much a national, regional, and international security is-sue as the proliferation of weaponry." During the Gulf War, the French company SPOT suspended sales of satel-lite imagery except to the Allied ar-mies, but was the only such company to do so. More recently, with the US de-cision to sell its oldest spy satellite photos for commercial and scientific use, Congress barred release of images of Israel more detailed than those avail-able commercially. That is gradually becoming meaningless as commercial imagery improves and several firms plan to launch imaging satellites and distribute their products on the In-ternet. As one congressional report con-cluded, "Where imagery is concerned the technology genie is clearly out of the bottle."

In a 1995 case that fed such worries, the govern-ment won convictions after a graduate student stole clas-sified mapping data from a Cornell University com-puter and sold it for commer-cial uses. The data, which were on restricted loan to the Geological Sciences Depart-ment's Andes Project, had passed through several hands by the time federal of-ficials were alerted. Prosecu-tors focused on a map vendor, Bill Stewart of Cartographic Imports (Ann Arbor, Michi-gan). Despite his claim that he had no idea the data were classified, he was convicted for felony conversion of infor-mation, conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud, and sentenced to 30 months in prison.

The surprisingly hardball prosecu-tion reflected real government fears. What had been stolen were DMA level-one digital terrain elevation data (DTED-1) for various parts of the world. Essentially lists of three-dimensional co-ordinates on the earth's surface at 94-meter intervals, the information is used in cruise missile guidance systems and other sensitive military applica-tions. DoD argues that DTED-1 could give foreign armies an offensive military capability, and that its coverage areas alone could reveal priorities of US or al-lied military forces. In 1993, the Joint Chiefs of Staff rebuffed a Freedom of In-formation Act request for DTED-1. They wrote that its release "has the potential of not only disclosing operational plan-ning but also the potential to jeopardize or significantly interfere with military or intelligence operations."

The government is caught in a bind: Unless maps and images are digitized, they cannot be woven into a seamless imagery system; but in that form they are more vulnerable to theft and sabotage. Predict-ably, everybody from hackers to spies is breaking into mili-tary computers via the In-ternet, once an exclusively military network. Last June, the General Accounting Office estimated more than 250,000 attempts in 1995 alone; 65 per-cent were successful. The DoD and CIA have launched major initia-tives to develop defenses against such "cyberwar." In 1995, a teenager in England tapped into a computer at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, New York, where the CIO's Bosnian images were assembled.

Concerns about information leakage have not prompted security officials to slow their race for a national imagery system. "Information supremacy may well define the US as a superpower," noted former NRO director Jeffrey Har-ris. "Winning wars in the information age, with US forces potentially stretched thin, will be possible because we control critical information."

For people around the world, how-ever, the Pentagon's ability to patrol their land from afar and to make war on them from a safe distance is a chilling prospect. US efforts such as NIMA to fuse a system of all-source intelligence data will no doubt continue to be cloaked as initiatives for peacekeeping, environmental monitoring, scientific research and the like, but it is sobering to realize that its prime use will be to reinforce the domination of peoples and resources on a global scale.

## Mexico Practices What School of the Americas Teaches

by Darrin Wood

Mexican generals implicated in serious human rights violations studied at the School of the Americas while the institution was routinely teaching torture techniques.

The US Army's School of the Americas (SOA) has never had much good press, but recently its reputation went into a tailspin. It all be-gan with an item in the June 28, 1996 Intelligence Oversight Board's "Report on the Guatemala Review":

"Congress was also notified of the 1991 discovery by DoD [Department of Defense] that the School of the Americas and Southern Command had used improper instruction ma-terials in training Latin American officers, including Guatemalans, from 1982 to 1991. These materials never received proper DoD review, and certain passages appeared to condone (or could have been inter-preted to condone) practices such as executions of guerrillas, extortion, physical abuse, coercion, and false imprisonment. On discovery of the error, DoD replaced and modified the materials, and instructed its representatives in the affected coun-tries to retrieve all copies of the materials from their foreign coun-terparts and to explain that some of the contents violated US policy."

Such practices in any case, the Pen-tagon assured, did not represent US government policy, and all instruction in torture, murder, and mayhem had been discontinued in 1991.

The government admission that the manuals did in fact exist and had con-doned torture was made under pres-sure. Despite numerous first-hand sighting, no one had managed to hold onto a copy until one made its way to Congress member Joseph Kennedy. When the Pentagon learned that the Massachusetts Democrat had the hard evidence, it tried to beat him to the punch and release the excerpts. The seven manuals — nearly 1,200 pages in the original Spanish — recom-mended using "fear, payment of boun-ties for enemy dead, beatings, false imprisonment, executions, and truth se-rum." The chilling text forever disproved the School's claims that the Noriegas, Banzers, and D'Aubuissons who came out of SOA were just a few "bad apples." Rather, they were the bad seeds that SOA acting as "Johnny Rot-ten-Appleseed" — had planted in the fertile ground of Latin American dictatorships.

SOA public affairs offi-cer Maj. Gordon Martell was left hanging out to dry by the change in the offi-cial line. He had admit-ted that some SOA grads were guilty of abuses but had down-played the impact. "Out of 59,000 stu-dents who have graduated from a variety of programs, less than 300 have been cited for human rights violations like torture and murder, and less than 50 have been convicted of anything." In fact, the low number had more to do with the level of impunity in Latin America than any failure of the stu-dents to master their lessons. And up until the end, the hapless Martell was denying that the manuals contained anything untoward. "All of the manuals used by the School of the Americas are approved by the Army, and the school has never done those things, ever, in its history."

### Torture, Lies, and Videotape

Two people who had been on the trail of the manuals were Robert Richter, whose 1995 film, *School of Assassins*, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Documentary, and Roy Bourgeois, a Maryknoll priest who had long opposed the school. After reading an article in CAQ that reported the existence of the manuals, they trav-eled to Paraguay. (The article had linked the manuals to serious hu-man rights abuses per-formed under Operation Condor and documented that they taught torturers how to keep prisoners alive during sessions using electric shock). In Asunción, Bourgeois and Richter met with Martín Almada, the activist and torture victim who had told CAQ of seeing the manuals and of having experienced their lessons first hand. Although the two did not find the instructional material, which had dis-appeared from the archive where it was catalogued, they ferreted out former SOA students who were now willing to talk. In Richter's updated version of the documentary, one of those former stu-dents revealed some of his "unconven-tional training":

Mr. X: "The difference between the conventional and the unconventional training is that we were trained to tor-ture human beings. They would use people from the streets of Panama, be-cause they would bring them into the base and the experts would train us on how to obtain that information through torture. And there were several ways of doing it. There was the psychological torture and there was of course the physical torture."

Bourgeois: "Are you saying that or-dinary citizens were brought to the School of the Americas and used as hu-man guinea pigs for torture?"

Mr. X: "Some of them were blind-folded and they were stripped and put in a certain situation, I mean setting, where they were tortured. At the time they had a medical physician, a US medical physician which I remember very well, who was dressed in green fa-tigues, who would teach the students in the nerve endings in the body, he would show them where to torture, where you wouldn't kill the individual. He would tell them how much the heart can toler-ate, can hold up. And there were also times where they would revive the per-son with a powerful drug. When the person was [near death], the doctor will tell you this is enough, you can't go on anymore because this man will die. So it's very simple. If he hasn't talked yet, then you've got to stop because other-wise, he'll be dead."

Richter also talked with José Valle, an SOA graduate and ex-member of the US-backed Honduran death squad Bat-talion 3-16. "They told us we could re-spect human rights, that it was not necessary to beat the prisoners," he said. "But that was in the classroom. The problem was that in the actual situ-ation the interrogators were told that they had to get the information out of the people in any way possible."

### Lesson Plans for Torture

The following are translations made directly from Spanish-language manuals obtained from DoD, by the National Security Archives.

*   "The government can quickly find out about insur-gent activity in these organizations by means of the distribution of its employees in all or-ganizations that are suspected of being of in-terest to the insurgent group. Among the main organizations of this type, one may mention the political parties, un-ions, and youth and student groups." ("Manejo de fuente," p. 7; excerpt not in-cluded in DoD Fact Sheet).
*   "The CI [Counter Intelligence] agent can in-crease the value of the employee by destroy-ing the structure of the guerrilla organization surrounding said employee. This can be done by means of arrests, executions or raids, taking care not to ex-pose the employee as the source of information." ("Manejo de fuente," p. 80, part of which was included in DoD Fact Sheet).
*   "Determine the method to neutralize personalities.... Place the identity of the Target on the Black, Gray or White lists.... Carry out psychological operations against person-alities.... Carry out propaganda operations to discredit the target.... Carry out deception op-erations. Neutralization by means of decep-tion may employ false information to con-fuse the target." ("Contrainteligencia," pp. 242-43; excerpt not included in DoD Fact Sheet).

The English manuals promoted the following tactics:
*   "A deserter could be more or less certain that there will be no reprisals against him if all other members of his cell are elimi-nated by government security forces."
*   "Once a security agent of the guerrilla organi-zation has been identified, he could be forced or induced to abandon his cause without abandoning his position or he could be neutralized."

Based on interviews, Richter be-lieves that the torture manuals — in use for seven years at Fort Benning — were used prior to 1982 and formed the basis for daily lesson plans at SOA.

### The SOA "Redefines" Itself

The increased public attention on the School of the Americas in the past few years has forced the School to scramble to justify its multi-million dollar budget and to fabricate a revisionist interpre-tation of its goals and curriculum. A re-cent article in the Spanish language edition of *Military Review* tries, without admitting past flaws, to "redefine" SOA's mission as the promotion of democratic principles and human rights in the hemisphere. "[...T]he School of the Americas has more possi-bilities than ever at this time to contrib-ute to those causes that are so important for its adversaries, even though they might not be convinced of it without first abandoning the notion that any use of military force in Latin America is inevitably wrong...." The article, according to its author, Army Lt. Col. Geoffrey B. Demarest, "is not di-rected to the enemies of the School nor does it offer any apology for what oc-curred in the past." An SOA graduate and an ex-assistant military attache at the US Embassy in Guatemala, he has good reason to know what he is not apologizing for.

Demarest does acknowledge that SOA's makeover will not be easy be-cause the concept of human rights "can be difficult for many Latin American of-ficers, since many of them consider that that term has been employed in a propa-gandistic and damaging way for some le-gitimate uses of military force." And Demarest admits that the issue of hu-man rights has been used for political expediency. "It is possible," he writes, "that the emphasis put on the subject of human rights has been a response to the School's critics, who have shown to be hardly convinced of its merit based on its role during the Cold War. With the end of said conflict, and in spite of the increased emphasis that the instruction in human rights receives, the School is still criticized because its fundamental concepts appear to be obsolete."

### SOA vs. EZLN

Although the school is currently deep into a PR campaign to paint a smiley face on a death's head, those "funda-mental concepts" still include the use of force to maintain the US "backyard" and to back the political and financial fortunes of those leaders who play ball in it. The role of SOA graduates in Mex-ico is a case in point. From 1953 to 1992, almost 500 Mexican military officers have received training at the SOA. Since the 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico has taken the lead in the number of Latin American military personnel receiving US military train-ing. With millions of dollars in US mili-tary aid and training, Mexico has undergone a massive militarization in the past few years. To top it off, Bill Clinton and the Pentagon recently un-veiled a plan to spend an additional $48 million on helicopters and training to shore up the Zedillo regime.

While it is impossible to know how many US-trained officers are partici-pating in counterinsurgency opera-tions, some evidence can be gleaned by checking SOA enrollment lists against press reports of military operations. The headquarters of the Mexican Army's 31st Military Zone, located at Rancho Nuevo near San Cristóbal de Las Casas in Chiapas, had a kind of SOA class reunion feel to it when Zapa-tistas rose up in arms on December 31, 1993. Three of the army generals there — Gaston Menchaca Arias, commander of the Military Zone, Miguel Leyva Gar-cía, and Enrique Alonso Garrido — were all SOA alumni. Menchaca Arias and Leyva García had been classmates at the SOA back in 1971.

However, Gen. Menchaca, who as a captain in 1971 when he studied "ir-regular warfare" at SOA, probably won't be the school's poster boy for mili-tary expertise. As the Zapatista Army was taking control of San Cristóbal in the early morning hours of January 1, 1994, Concepción Villafuerte of the San Cristóbal newspaper *El Tiempo*, called the Commander at 1:45 am to ask him why there were so many armed people in the town. The US-trained specialist replied: "I don't know. Aren't they just people celebrating New Year's?"

As the fighting continued in early January of 1994, another SOA grad, Gen. Juan López Ortiz, was sent into Chiapas with troops under his com-mand from the states of Campeche and Tabasco. In a 1994 interview with the Mexican magazine *Impacto*, this SOA grad called the EZLN "very criminal peo-ple [who] dare to call themselves an army while they send people to their deaths, armed with wooden rifles; when they use innocent people as human shields and they cover their faces with ski masks." López Ortiz had first made a name for himself in 1974 fighting the Partido de los Pobres (Party of the Poor) in the mountains of the Mexican state of Guerrero. That infamous campaign left hundreds of peasants "disappeared." In 1994, the troops he commanded in the town of Ocosingo massacred suspected Zapatistas in the town's market; the prisoners' hands were tied behind their backs before the soldiers shot them in the back of the head.

The February 1995 invasion by the Mexican army of territory controlled by the EZLN brought another SOA grad onto the scene. Gen. Manuel García Ruiz (SOA Class of 1980 — the same year and course as Gen. Garrido), boasted to journalists of the army's "hu-manitarian" work in the aftermath of the invasion of the Lacandona jungle. According to the Mexican news weekly *Proceso*: "Brigadier Gen. Manuel Gar-cía Ruiz, with a diploma from the Gen-eral Staff, was ordered to occupy Nuevo Momon, one of the Zapatista strong-holds; on Friday, February 10, Lieut. Col. Hugo Manterola was killed in cir-cumstances that still haven't been cleared up." Testimony compiled by the press states that there was an exchange of gunfire, which lasted approxi-mately 10 minutes, between govern-ment and Zapatista soldiers. Gen. García Ruiz's official version, how-ever, denies that a confrontation oc-curred and claims that Manterola was the victim of a sniper.

Chiapas has also report-edly suffered the presence of a group of mercenaries from Argentina who were sent to the infamous 31st Military Zone in July of 1994 to help the Mexican Army perfect its counterin-surgency tactics. These same Argentines have worked for the CIA in the past in training US-backed death squads in Honduras led by SOA graduate Gen. Gustavo Al-varez Martínez.

In 1974, López Ortiz had led an infamous campaign in which hun-dreds of peasants were "disappeared."*

### SOA vs. EPR

On June 28, a new guerrilla organiza-tion calling itself the EPR (Ejército Popular Revolucionario — Popular Revolutionary Army) appeared in Guerrero during a memorial service for 17 peasants murdered by police in Aguas Blancas the previous year. In Au-gust, the EPR carried out coordinated attacks throughout Mexico. In their pursuit were SOA graduates in the states of Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán, More-los, Oaxaca, Tamaulipas, and Yu-catán. Some SOA grads who were stationed in Chiapas and are now in-volved in anti-EPR operations are gener-als Menchaca Arias, García Ruiz, and Juan López Ortiz.

With US-trained troops or weapons on the ground almost everywhere, US Am-bassador to Mexico James Jones was coy about Washington's role. After the EPR's attacks in August, he said that although Mexico still hadn't directly asked for sup-port from its friendly northern neighbor, the US would be more than willing to offer help and expertise in combatting the new guerrillas. Mexico has yet to publicly accept that goodwill. But so far, military aid to Mexico, mostly under the guise of anti-drug campaigns, has led to many "gifts" of helicop-ters and airplanes.

Predictably, the militarization of Mex-ico, which was occur-ring before the appearance of the EPR, has been accompanied by an increase in the number of reported human rights abuses. Nowhere has that link been more prominent than in the long suffer-ing state of Guerrero, whose 9th Mili-tary Region contains two military zones, the 27th, located in the tourist resort town of Acapulco, and the 35th, located in the town of Chilpancingo. From the June 1995 peasant massacre by police, to the recent allegations of the rape of 12 indigenous women by the army, Guerrero had more than its share of brutality and School of the Americas graduates.

In a report on the 1995 Aguas Blan-cas massacre, *Proceso* noted that five weeks after the atrocity, Gen. Adrian Maldonado Ramírez was relieved as the commander of the 35th Military Zone, which is in the same military region in which the atrocities took place. In 1978 and 1979, Maldonado Ramírez had stud-ied "Joint Operations - Latin America" at SOA. So far, the scandal surrounding the government ambush of the unarmed civilians has resulted in the prosecution of the police officers who pulled the trig-gers and the resignation of Gov. Rubén Figueroa. With Maldonado Ramírez safely transferred, the possible role of the military in the ambush has re-mained unexamined. This omission is particularly troublesome in light of the statement by retired US Army Col. Rex Applegate that "[Mexican] army zone commanders generally work closely with state officials..."

The current com-mander of the 9th Mili-tary Region located in Acapulco is Gen. Ed-mundo Elpidio Leyva Galindo. During a search mission for the EPR in September, which he reportedly headed, one of his troops thought he saw some masked men running in an open field. Using a reporter's cellular phone the gen-eral ordered, "Shoot them, kill them..."

Leyva Galindo not only is a graduate of the School of the Americas, but was there for the same years and for courses as Maldonado Ramírez.

Leyva Galindo and Maldonado aren't the only former SOA class-mates involved in the Mexican Army's pur-suit of the EPR. Gen. Renato García Gon-zález, the current com-mander of the 27th Military Zone in Aca-pulco, trained at the School of the Americas in 1980 along with Gen. Rubén Rivas Peña, the commander of the 28th Military Zone, located in the neighboring state of Oaxaca. Both coin-cided with the previously mentioned Gens. Enrique Garrido and Manuel García Ruiz. Oddly enough, the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca were the sites of the EPR's strongest attacks on Au-gust 28, 1996.

### Counterinsurgency With a Human Face

The latest disclosures about the School of the Americas have revived calls to shut it down — sort of. Activists have backed Rep. Joseph Kennedy's (D-Mass.) proposed house bill, HR 2652, which would "close the United States Army School of the Americas and estab-lish a United States Academy for De-mocracy and Civil-Military Relations."

A closer look at HR 2652 doesn't leave much hope for Latin Americans. Under its new, blandly cheery name, the "Academy" would eliminate combat training with live ammunition and emphasize "human rights" and civilian control of the military. But, as a former SOA instructor wrote: "The military skills required to oppress indigenous populations were finely honed long before most Latin American faculty members and students were flown in at U.S. government expense for their vacations in Columbus [Georgia]." The Kennedy bill does not, however, ban such training at other institutions currently run by the US military.

The bill's supporters should prob-ably also scrutinize the concept of "Civil-Military" relations. According to the US Army's Command and General Staff College Field Manual 100-20: "Civil-military operations (CMO) in-clude all military efforts to support host nation development, co-opt insurgent issues, gain support for the national government, and attain national objec-tives without combat. Successful CMOS reduce or eliminate the need for combat operations, especially when initiated early in the insurgency. They also help prepare the area of operations for com-bat forces, if they are required."

In the "First Declaration of the Selva Lacandona" from Mexico's Zapatista Army, the General Command of the EZLN called for "summary trials against the soldiers of the Mexican Federal Army and the political police who have received courses and have been advised, trained, or paid by for-eigners..."

While that scenario may seem exag-gerated, nonetheless, there should be a full investigation of those parts of the curriculum that have been connected to human rights abuses. Those found responsible for these and other abuses should be ex-posed, tried, and pun-ished. Then the program should be ended and all US training of foreign militaries should cease. If that does not happen, the School of the Americas, or whatever name it goes by in the future, runs the danger of being, as Lt. Col. De-marest states in his article in *Military Re-view* "an even more useful organization in the post-Cold War world than it was dur-ing this conflict."

And that, given the role of the School of the Americas during those grim years, is a frightening concept.

## Afghanistan: The Great Game Continues

by Asad Ismi and Farhan Haq

The destabilization that the US fomented when it sought to overthrow the Soviet-backed government continues. Despite initial US hopes that the Taliban would restore order — no matter what the human cost — the region stubbornly remains unsafe for US interests.

The story of how the US and its re-gional ally, Pakistan, have courted triumph and disaster in Afghani-stan through support of questionable leaders and dubious policies is yet an-other case study in how ill-conceived for-eign policy and CIA meddling can bring ruin in the name of US interests.

On September 26, a new protagonist in the tale took center stage when mem-bers of the Islamist Taliban rebels forced their way into the United Nations com-pound in Kabul. For the past four years it had been home to Mohammed Najibul-lah, former communist president of Af-ghanistan, and his brother, Shahpur Amadzai. The rebels shot the brothers and hung their corpses, dollar bills stuffed in their mouths, from a tower, where the city's residents could see the fate of the nation's last Soviet-backed leader. The close of this latest chapter of Afghani-stan's long war seemed to be scripted by the CIA: the Communists routed, the Is-lamic mujahedin in command.

The plot, however, has taken some dis-turbing twists. The Taliban (students), formed in 1994 in the madrassas (theo-logical schools) of northern Pakistan, are not the anticommunist Islamic rebels to whom the CIA had funneled some $5-6 billion between the Soviet invasion in 1979 and its withdrawal 10 years later. When the Taliban launched their first assault on Afghanistan in October 1994 from a base in Pakistan, they were one more faction in the complex civil war. Two years later, they had seized Kabul and most of the country and gained the upper hand against the main US-supported groups, Berhanud-din Rabbani's Jamiat-i-Islami (Islamic Society) and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami (Islamic Party). These groups may yet beat back the Taliban (at the time of writing, they have begun to regain strategic territory around Kabul). But if the Taliban retain power, Washington will have a hard time justi-fying an alliance with the group: In the two-thirds of Afghanistan which have fallen under their control during the past two years, the Taliban have banned a variety of activities as un-Is-lamic, including television, music, most sports, and even kite-flying. Their treatment of women has drawn almost universal condemnation, much of it from the Islamic world. The "students" have imposed fanatically extreme dress codes, banned women from working, and forbidden their education. "The worst fate befalls women in need of medical attention: Men are not allowed to treat them, but neither are women allowed to work in most clinics or hospitals."

What role the US played in the rise of the Taliban is not yet clear, but on the day the rebels captured Kabul, State De-partment spokesperson Glyn Davies touted them as "the group that might fi-nally bring stability to Afghanistan," and mildly labeled the execution of former President Najibullah "regrettable." Davies held out the possibility of re-es-tablishing full diplomatic ties and ex-pressed hope that "the new authorities in Kabul will move quickly to restore or-der and security and to form a repre-sentative interim government that can begin the process of reconciliation nation-wide." This quick support led to specu-lation that the US had been aiding the Taliban all along. But even if that is not the case, Washington certainly contrib-uted to the disorder and Islamist in-fighting that set the scene for the group's creation and quick success.

And, to a dramatic extent, the Tali-ban serve many of Washington's key strategic and economic policy goals in the Central Asian region. The US hoped that by keeping Teheran's Shi'ite rulers on edge, the Taliban's anti-Shi'a tenets (part of their strict Hanafi brand of Sunni orthodoxy) would further the US policy of containing Iran. The Taliban also showed early cooperation by shut-ting down one of the terrorist training camps against which Washington had rallied. The US also hoped the Taliban would impose the kind of stability that makes foreign investment and trade possible. The US would prefer warm ties with any government in Kabul which could assist its efforts to secure a multibillion dollar natural gas pipeline and an oil pipeline project involving the US firm Unocal and the Saudi group Delta Oil. The two companies have reached an agreement with the former Soviet republic Turkmenistan for the pipeline which would go through Af-ghanistan into Pakistan. It is projected to bring some $300 million a year to the Afghan economy and net large profits for the energy companies. Uzbek leader Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum held discus-sions with Unocal officials in Dallas last April on the portion of the pipeline that would pass through the northern territories under his control. It seemed in late September that a friendly Tali-ban government would ensure the ven-ture's feasibility and security — a crucial dividend for Washington, which wishes to prevent the creation of a simi-lar pipeline proposed by Pakistan and Iran. Indeed, this may have been the largest single factor behind Washing-ton's cautious acceptance of the nascent Taliban state.

Within a few weeks, however, as Af-ghanistan slipped back into civil war, the US was backing away from its early support. Even the *New York Times* noted some interesting timing: "The shifting of the Administration's position coincided with a similar shift by the Uno-cal Corporation." Where the company had formerly been quoted as "very posi-tive," Marty Miller, the Unocal vice president in charge of the project, now insisted that Unocal was "fanatically neutral when it comes to politics."

### Regional Power Shifts

If the US role in the Taliban's rise is veiled, those of Pakistan and Saudi Ara-bia, Washington's closest allies and some-time surrogates in the region, were more overt. Of the UN's 185 members, Paki-stan alone rushed to recognize the Tali-ban government. Between 1992 and 1996, the arms funneled to the muja-hedin had paved the way for brutal combat among the Hezb-i-Islami and the Jamiat-i-Islami, and played per-haps the largest role in fueling early support for the Taliban. Indeed, as UN Undersecretary-General Marrack Gould-ing made clear after a visit to Afghani-stan shortly before the Taliban seized Kabul, Hekmatyar's and Rabbani's con-tinued divisiveness and defections by their war-weary troops played a major role in the Taliban's almost bloodless seizure of most of 21 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces. And Pakistan's Inter-Serv-ices Intelligence (ISI) agency almost certainly helped arm and train the Tali-ban, in part to counter the drug smug-gling and weapons trade across its bor-der fueled by the continuing conflict. They also wanted to avoid a destabiliza-tion of Northern Pakistan which shares a Pathan population with Afghanistan. The Saudis, too, looked with favor on their fellow Sunni Muslims as a bul-wark against Iran. The Saudis funded the madrassas — laying the original base for the formation of the Taliban in the 1990s — and continued to provide training bases, financial backing, and political support.

By contrast, Iranian President Hashe-mi Rafsanjani was bluntly antagonistic to the Taliban's gains: "This is a disas-ter, and we regret it." Ayatollah Ali Khamenehi, Iran's chief cleric, explic-itly blamed the group's victory on Tehe-ran's nemesis, arguing, "The US support for this group... is an attempt to con-front the Islamic Republic of Iran." Kha-menehi claimed that Washington has been secretly aiding the Taliban, "whose knowledge of Islam is unknown."

Also worried, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned of "the danger that [the Taliban's victory] poses to the in-ternational community and its destabi-lizing effect on the situation in the region." During his short tenure as national security adviser, Aleksandr Lebed put his warning in tough terms reminiscent of Soviet posturing during its own Afghan involvement: "If the Tali-ban, backed by Pakistan, reaches the border with Ta-jikistan and Uzbekistan, including the city of Bok-hara [which] they want to annex, they will wipe away Russian border posts and see the road to the north free." Likewise, officials in Tajikistan are understood to fear that the Taliban will back Tajiki fundamental-ists although Rabbani has also aided those groups at times. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, however, appear am-bivalent: "The Turkmenians hope to ex-port gas through western Afghanistan and keep the Taliban from interfering in their affairs; the Uzbeks have been exploring an alliance with Pakistan that would enable them to trade via In-dian Ocean ports and so lessen their de-pendence on Russia."

### Unholy Wars

The fate of such calculations, and of Hekmatyar's role as a "useful tool," took a turn for the worse after the Soviets with-drew in 1989, leaving Najibul-lah's trusted Communist secret police in charge. Although Washington and Moscow now both sought stability — albeit on their own terms — in Af-ghanistan, the mujahedin in-fighting intensified, particularly as the rebels extracted drug profits from Nangahar prov-ince, where about 80 percent of Afghanistan's poppy produc-tion takes place. The trade in drugs and guns also began to hit Pakistan. There, smuggled rocket launchers started to be used in ethnic riots in Karachi while arms traders enjoyed brisk sales for Kalashnikovs and other automatic weapons from the war zone. Although prohibited in Pakistan, some were even bought as presents for government officials.

It was no secret to the United States that some of its main allies during the Soviet phase of the war were the chief beneficiaries of the drug trade. "The U.S. government has for several years received, but declined to investigate, reports of heroin trafficking by some Afghan guerrillas and Pakistani military officers with whom it co-operates," the *Washing-ton Post* reported after the Soviet pullout. Hek-matyar, in particular, was alleged by US offi-cials to have been deeply involved in the nar-cotraffic. Soon, fight-ing in the mujahedin-held zones was focused as much on gaining control of the main heroin pro-ducing regions as on defeating Najibul-lah's faltering state. By 1995, opium production had risen to 2,200 tons a year, up from only 200 tons in 1978.

### The Great Game, Updated

Today, Afghanistan is the subject of the machinations of at least six nations in the region — Iran, Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Russia — as well as the continuing influence of the mujahedin's two main outside pa-trons, Saudi Arabia and the United States. The leader in the pro-Taliban camp is Pakistan, which seeks stability along its northwestern border, and a lessening of the flow of drugs and guns which has turned its Northwest Fron-tier Province into a major heroin trans-shipment point and Karachi into a virtual free-fire zone. The control of Af-ghanistan's major trade routes by the Taliban offers Pakistan an additional benefit: a potential land route from the Pakistani city of Quetta to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, two former Soviet repub-lics eager to export the cotton which Pakistan's textile mills often lack.

Along with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan also looks forward to a nation ruled by Sunni Islamists who have received training from both nations — and whose Pathan ethnicity, shared with northwest Paki-stan, is expected to ease tensions and increase trade.

The anti-Taliban camp includes na-tions such as India, which wants to see Pakistan's regional ambitions con-tained, and those which, like Tajikis-tan, fear the Afghan Islamists will spread their radical religious views to their largely secular neighbors. Tajikis-tan also backed Rabbani, an ethnic Ta-jik who took a moderate line on supporting Afghanistan-based Tajikis-tani Islamists seeking to overthrow the secular post-Communist government in Dushanbe. Following Rabbani's flight from Kabul, however, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan united behind Uzbek warlord and former Communist general Abdul Rashid Dos-tum, albeit offering him varying de-grees of support. Dostum was friendly to the Taliban as recently as this spring and was seeking better relations with Pakistan and the US. But by mid-October, after two years of enmity, Dos-tum had partnered with Ahmad Shah Massoud in a concerted counteroffen-sive against the Taliban, which he blamed for the failure of cease-fire talks brokered by Pakistan and the UN.

Iran's case is more complex: its Shi'a ally in Afghanistan, the Hezb-i-Wahdat, was routed by Rabbani and then forced to surrender to the Taliban outside Kabul. The leader of the Shi'a group, Ali Mazari, "died under suspicious circum-stances while in the custody of the Tali-ban and the shi'a believe that Mazari was killed by his captors." Iran has subsequently backed Rabbani, whose followers speak Farsi as Iranians do, while the Taliban speak Pashto; yet none of the Sunni Islamist leaders of-fers much advantage to Teheran's aims to expand its regional influence at pre-sent. With Hekmatyar all but defunct as a military asset — his fighters joined with Rabbani over the summer, but did little to stop the Taliban's advance — Massoud and Dostum have gained the bulk of support from the Central Asian and Russian governments.

The US, on the other hand, is still keeping its options open, much as it has done ever since the Soviets withdrew, leaving Washington in a bind over which of its assembly of warlords would best serve US interests. In one of the State Council's first statements after the capture of Kabul, the Taliban vowed to combat terrorism, and it has already closed one of the training camps near the Pakistani border. The US is less op-timistic that the Taliban will curtail the lucrative flow of raw opium from Af-ghanistan, which brings in hard cash and foreign exchange. According to US sources, "Taliban has followed the prac-tice of other Afghan armed groups in tolerating, and sometimes even taxing, the traffic." UN data appear to con-firm these suspicions: The Interna-tional Drug Control Program (UNDCP) found that poppy cultivation and yield in the 1995-96 growing season — when the Taliban held 95 percent of the area under cultivation — was at "virtually the same level" as during the previous growing season.

In fact, the UN estimated a slight in-crease in cultivation areas, while esti-mated yield rose by 8.8 percent over the 1994-95 season. The agency concluded that the Taliban's ban on marijuana us-age and trafficking actually helped boost opium cultivation in Oruzgan and Qandahar provinces. "The Talibans, who as fundamentalist Muslims oppose all forms of intoxication, oppose opium smoking, but in order to protect their support base have refused to declare a ban on the cultivation of poppy and traf-ficking in opium," the UNDCP noted.

The Taliban's opponents, however, are convinced that the geopolitical situ-ation will yet work in their favor. Rab-bani's side hopes that the worries over the students' extremist views — al-ready branded "primitive" and "medie-val" in several Western newspapers — will win it the unified support of the in-ternational community it so clearly lacked after it ousted Najibullah in 1992. Rabbani's Deputy Foreign Minis-ter Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai warned the UN, "The outside sponsors of the Taliban are attempting to cover up [the Taliban's] actual identity and nature, thus soliciting a kind of legitimacy for this illegitimate, obscurantist and ter-rorist group. Any relation established with the Taliban may be interpreted by the Taliban as if they have been toler-ated by the international community."

The UN is hedging its bets on whether the Taliban is capable of re-form. Upon his return from a mid-Sep-tember visit to Afghanistan, Goulding said of the Taliban, "Some of their views are monstrous." But, he added, the guerrilla leaders he met had no knowl-edge of the UN Charter, but after read-ing the document they claimed to be willing to uphold its tenets, including equal rights for women.

The Taliban, however, continue to send out contradictory signals: After Goulding's visit, the new leaders in Kabul issued statements that previous restrictions on women's movement and dress had been "wartime measures" and would be rescinded shortly; simul-taneously, reports from Kabul indicated that women were being beaten if they failed to cover themselves thoroughly in accordance with the Taliban's edicts. In response, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned that failure to respect women's rights could have "serious repercussions on the ability of the United Nations to de-liver programs of relief and reconstruc-tion to the country."

The history of the Afghanistan war has one of reversed expectations. The Soviet Union, which had hoped to strengthen its grip on Central Asia, was forced into a humiliating retreat. Paki-stan's military rulers had openly cheered at the prospect of a US aid bo-nanza following the 1979 Soviet inva-sion. Instead of prospering, Pakistan has been destabilized by the immense drug and arms traffic, which have fanned the flames of ethnic conflict in Karachi. Warlords such as Hekmatyar have slid in and out of obscu-rity, a fate which may yet await the rela-tively new faces be-hind the Taliban.

Even Washington, which invested so much in the war and was clearly pleased at the slow bleeding of the Sovi-ets, has grown ever more concerned with economic instability, increased heroin flow into the US, and the emer-gence of terrorist groups such as the one responsible for the World Trade Center bombing — all, at least in part, conse-quences of US support for the muja-hedin. In the long term, US interests may suffer new setbacks with the emer-gence of a new Islamist government that may yet prove as repressive and aggressive as those in Iran and the Su-dan. So long as the economic, geopoliti-cal, and ideological stakes remain high, however, the great game seems des-tined to endure.

## Crack, Contras & The CIA

### Tracking CIA-Contra-Crack Links

by Dennis Bernstein and Robert Knight

If federal investigators dig into the growing controversy over the CIA's alleged role in drug trafficking to support the Contra war in Nicaragua, there will be plenty of witnesses and documentation from their own court re-cords. At least a half dozen federal trials between 1984 and 1991 implicate Con-tra operatives and their US handlers in drug-related operations that were never followed up by US law enforcement.

The court records reveal a vast shadow world of wheeler-dealers, ex-spies, former government officials, and immunized witnesses who worked at various levels of the Contra re-supply op-eration. Their testimony could bolster allegations raised in the *San Jose Mer-cury News* series that the CIA was aware of or involved with drug trafficking to support the Contra war.

Perhaps the most compelling exam-ple is the trial of cartel kingpin José Ra-fael Abello, labeled by the FBI as "the most dangerous cartel leader ever to be extradited to the United States." In 1990, Abello was convicted in Tulsa, Okla-homa, largely on evidence supplied by his longtime operative, Fabio Ernesto Carrasco. Carrasco agreed to testify against his former boss in exchange for immunity from his own prosecution on other trafficking charges. During several days of thorough debriefings with US Customs officials and federal prosecu-tors, Carrasco disclosed that from 1984-86, he worked as a liaison between CIA-backed Contra leaders in Costa Rica and self-described cartel operative George Morales. Senate investigators and several Contra leaders have identi-fied Morales as a key funder of the Con-tras after Congress cut off the official flow of money.

Carrasco described how Contra leaders Popo Chamorro, Octaviano César, and others in Costa Rica ar-ranged for almost a ton of cocaine to be brought in from Colombia and Panama. After the drugs arrived at Costa Rican Contra camps, Carrasco and other members of the Morales organization supervised transport to the US.

### Testimony in Tulsa

In startling detail, Carrasco described under oath how in the fall of 1984, Con-tra leaders ordered Morales to land co-caine-filled planes at public airports in south Florida, assuring him that the flights would be "protected." Carrasco claimed he was one of the flights to North Miami's bustling Opa-Locka air-port, then under heavy surveillance by federal authorities because of its con-venient location for drug flights from Central and South America. The flight landed in the late afternoon and taxied to a hangar controlled by Morales, who was already under indictment by fed-eral drug prosecutors for utilizing that same hangar for smuggling activities. According to Carrasco, more than 400 kilos of cocaine packed in military-style duffel bags were unloaded in plain view on the tarmac.

Carrasco's sworn statements about this incident and the involvement of Contra leaders in trafficking were part of wide-ranging disclosures he made about drug smuggling activities in Haiti, Central America, and the Carib-bean. But it was not until he was cross-examined at the trial by Abello's defense attorneys that the CIA connec-tion was spotlighted.

Q: "Mr. Carrasco, during the time that you were working for Mr. Morales in 1983 and '84 and '85 and into '86, you knew that George Morales claimed to have connections to the CIA agency of the United States, right?"
A: "Yes, that's right."
Q: "And as a result of those CIA con-nections with Mr. Morales, you knew that he had protection to bring drugs into the United States, didn't you?"
A: "That's right."

Carrasco went on to testify that he had delivered weapons and retrieved cocaine from land controlled by Costa Rica-based longtime CIA operative John Hull. "They were war weapons, not personal type weapons," Carrasco stated. "There were submachine guns and I think grenade launchers." The drugs, he said, "came in military bags, green in color." Carrasco also said he met with Contra leaders in Florida and Central America, including Octaviano César, Popo Chamorro, Marcos Ar-guado, and Gerardo Duran, who claimed they were working for the CIA. Morales said César and Aguado cited their CIA links when they promised to "take care of the legal problems" (i.e., a 1983 drug indictment) in exchange for his help in arming the Contras. According to Car-rasco, between 1983 and 1985, he met with César and Chamorro 30 to 40 times to deliver millions of dollars in proceeds from Contra cocaine sales. Carrasco's testimony is consistent with Morales'statements in 1987 to the Sen-ate Committee on Narcotics and Inter-national Terrorism, headed by John Kerry (D-Mass.). There, Morales testi-fied that four contra leaders — the same four named by Carrasco — were involved in arms-for-drugs operations in 1984-85, when the Boland Amend-ment banned military aid to the Con-tras. Morales also implicated John Hull, who was eventually barred from the country by the Costa Rican govern-ment because of "the quantity and fre-quency of the shipment of drugs" that flowed through his property.

### Yet Another Link

Although not everything Carrasco said can be taken at face value, his trial adds one more example to a consistent pat-tern. Because he had immunity only for those operations which he revealed un-der the agreement, he had an incentive to confess to the broadest possible range of offensives. And while it is also true that witnesses who are given immunity in exchange for information tend to in-flate their own importance and that of their operations, Carrasco's assertions are consistent with other disclosures and the findings of the Kerry committee.

Florida-based attorney John Mattes, who had assisted Kerry's 1987 investi-gation into Contra drug trafficking, said that "Carrasco's revelations in Tulsa corroborated and confirmed much of what we had already uncov-ered in the investigation of the Contras from 1985 to 1988. The Tulsa disclo-sures echoed earlier testimony that the contra leaders had been able to smuggle a massive amount of cocaine into the United States unimpeded."

In October, spurred by public outrage over the Mercury News stories, the Sen-ate Intelligence Committee reopened in-vestigations into CIA-Contra drug trafficking. At the hastily called hearing, Jack Blum, former Kerry committee special counsel, charged that US policymakers had consistently ig-nored Contra drug dealing, and that "peo-ple connected very directly to the CIA" had allowed airstrips and other facilities to be used for narcotrafficking.

### Cracking CIA-Contra-Drug Connections

by Clarence Lusane

Recent revelations have linked the CIA to the crack plague. But only by framing the discussion in the context of a critique of US foreign policy objectives that have been operating since at least the mid-1940s, can the solid link between international affairs, racism, and illegal drugs be grasped.

In a series of explosive stories for the San Jose Mercury News, investiga-tive reporter Gary Webb asserts that US-backed Contras and Contra-supporters imported cocaine into the United States; that the cocaine was sold to at least one major Los Angeles black drug dealer with ties or membership in the Crips street gang; and that the CIA was aware of the Contra drug activities and chose to either ignore them or to protect the traffickers.

The response to the series from the black community has been phenomenal. Reprints sold on the streets of Harlem, Washington, DC, and other cities have ensured wide access, while Internet postings have spread the story like wildfire the world. Forums and meetings as well as demonstrations and other protests have demanded action; congressmembers and black leaders have called for investigative hearings.

### What It Said, What It Didn't

What is new and particularly shocking in Webb's series is his charge that US-backed Contras and Contra supporters imported cocaine into the US and sold it to black street gangs in Los Angeles. The Contra drug dealers, according to the *Mercury News*, "met with CIA agents both before and during the time they were selling the drugs in LA." De-spite their US backing, Nicaragua's Contras were often hard up for cash. Most of them were supporters of the US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza, who had seized power in 1936 and whose dynasty ruled Nicaragua with notable corruption and brutality. In 1979, a group of rebels, the Sandinistas, took power and instituted numerous lit-eracy, health, and land reform pro-grams. Washington was appalled both by their overtly Marxist cast and by their policies that favored the interests of peasants and workers over those of large landowners and international corporations. In response, with White House approval, the CIA created a Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) in mid-1981. This coalition of several groups, mostly Somoza loyalists, waged Washington's surrogate war against the Nicaraguan people even after inter-nationally certified elections were held. By the mid-1980s, the FDN had racked up a horrifying human rights record while the Sandinistas had garnered strong support around the world from both governments and solidarity groups. Under pressure, Congress cut off funding, but some US money authorized by President Reagan continued to pass covertly through the CIA. Some of the Contras looked to drug money to supple-ment the clandestine flow.

Webb's revelations added to the pic-ture by showing that from around 1982 to 1986, two men linked to the Contras — Los Angeles cocaine trafficker Danilo Blandon and his San Francisco-based supplier Norwin Meneses — sold large quantities of cocaine to "Freeway" Rick Ross. Ross, a black 22-year-old street dealer with ties to the Crips street gang in Los Angeles, turned the cocaine he bought from Blandon and Meneses into crack. Because the Nica-raguans' prices were well below normal costs, Ross quickly became a major dealer with broad influence over the spread of crack in Los Angeles.

Part of the profits made from the drugs that Blandon and Meneses sold to Ross, according to Ross' testimony cited by the San Jose Mercury News, were "then used to buy weapons and equipment for a guerrilla army." At first the CIA and Contra leaders, including Adolfo Calero, the US-based political leader of the FDN, insisted that Mene-ses was not a key player in the Contra war and that they were surprised to find out that he was involved with drugs. These disclaimers don't ring true. Meneses says that, for at least five years, he raised funds for the Contras, visited Contra camps, and sent people to Honduras to work for the Contras. Calero concedes Meneses visited Con-tra camps numerous times during the 1980s and the two men were even pho-tographed together at a Contra fund-raiser in San Francisco. Also, Calero's professed ignorance of Meneses' traf-ficking is not credible. A detailed *San Francisco Examiner* story linked Mene-ses' drug trafficking to his Contra con-nections. Not only was Meneses well-known in the US as a large-scale dealer, Nicaraguan newspapers dubbed him "Rey de la Droga" (King of Drugs). Af-ter being instructed to conduct a search, the CIA admitted that it had re-cords going back to 1984 implicating Meneses in drug trafficking.

### Media Role in the Misinformation Campaign

The major media, which had been over-looking or debunking CIA links to drug-dealing Contras for a decade, responded to Webb's series by either ignoring them or running a story on the story im-pugning Webb's motives, facts, and re-search skills. The corporate press responded to outrage in the black com-munity by chalking it up to what the *Washington Post* termed "black para-noia." While noting that a long history of government-sponsored activities against the black community have jus-tified black suspicion, the majors have categorized those suspicions as base-less conspiracies comparable to tales of UFO abductions.

There are inaccuracies and exag-gerations in Webb's series which the major media seized on, but instead of correcting the record on specifics, they used the flaws to dismiss the piece out-of-hand. They also created straw men only to tear them down. For example, while Webb exaggerates the case when he writes that the cocaine sold to Ross and later turned into crack created "the first mass market in America" for the drug, he never states, as some of his debunkers have charged, that Ross alone was responsible for the prolifera-tion or for its invention. It is gener-ally agreed that the stunning spread of crack in Los Angeles did occur around the time Blandon and Ross entered the market, but Webb explains how they took advantage of, rather than created, the circumstance in which "street-level drug users were figuring out how to make cocaine affordable... by changing the pricey white powder into powerful little nuggets that could be smoked — crack."

Nor does the series allege that the CIA as an agency or any of its identifi-able employees directly sold drugs in the US or specifically targeted the black community. These charges have been made by both critics and proponents of the series.

Even though the *Washington Post* and *Los Angeles Times* successfully challenged some of the *Mercury's* de-tails — such as the amount of cocaine sold to Ross and the profits they made — they do not address the broad issues and their implications. By asking the wrong questions they have diverted at-tention from critical points. For exam-ple: Even if the US-created taxpayer-paid Contras dealt only one rock of crack with the tacit approval of US offi-cials, then serious policy and ethical problems exist (not to mention legal ones).

Despite some factual errors, the *Mer-cury News* series has not only added evi-dence on how racism intersects with US drug and foreign policies, but also raised two key questions to which the blackcom-munity has long sought answers:
1) Did the CIA or other US officials authorize and participate in the market-ing and distribution of crack cocaine to the black community as a matter of policy or strategy?
2) Have the CIA and other US in-telligence agencies, through covert op-erations and other activities, facilitated a flow of drugs into the United States that has resulted in in-creased use and sales in the black com-munity?

The answer to the first question, so far as can be determined, is no. Neither the series nor other reports and studies provide evidence of such high-level authorization and targeting of the black community. While there are ex-amples of convictions of US officials for narcotics trafficking, no conspiratorial network inside the CIA has ever been identified. If the question were re-phrased to ask if the blight of drugs in the black community has had seren-dipitous effects — the blunting of social protest and organizing, an excuse to warehouse in prisons hundreds of thou-sands of young black men for whom there are no jobs — the answer would be yes. But a useful consequence that is tolerated or even appreciated is not the same as a deliberate conspiracy.

### History of Involvement

Official collaboration between US gov-ernment entities and known drug traf-fickers dates back at least to World War II. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS), predecessor of the CIA, made deals with Corsican heroin traffickers as well as with US gangster and known heroin dealer Lucky Luciano to prevent communists from gaining a political foothold in post-war France and Italy.

From 1924-44, the US heroin addict population had dropped from 200,000 to about 20,000. Then Washington, "through the CIA and its wartime prede-cessor, the OSS, created a situation that made it possible for the Sicilian-Ameri-can Mafia and the Corsican underworld to revive the international narcotics traffic," according to the leading aca-demic study on the topic. After Lu-ciano established a worldwide network of traffickers, distributors, and retail-ers for the drug, the number of US ad-dicts grew rapidly again.

Similar alliances led to similar con-sequences in Southeast Asia. In Laos, beginning around 1960, the CIA cre-ated a secret army of 30,000 Hmong tribesmen to fight their communist gov-ernment. Hmong Gen. Vang Pao (who eventually moved to Montana) was al-lowed to use the CIA's Air America planes to traffic opium, the Hmong's major cash crop. Turned into heroin, this crop not only addicted thousands of US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, includ-ing a disproportionate number of Afri-can Americans, but by the war's end in the mid-1970s, comprised about one-third of all heroin in the US. By 1989, Southeast Asia was producing 73 per-cent of the world's heroin.

Beginning in the late 1970s, in Southwest Asia's Golden Crescent — where Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran come together — the US supported the anticommunist mujahedin guerrillas fighting against their Soviet-backed government. The CIA's covert activities in the region created new trafficking lines and a tremendous wave of heroin that flooded the lucrative US market. Scholar Alfred McCoy noted one of the con-sequences: "As heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan poured into America throughout 1979 — the number of drug-related deaths in New York City rose by 77 percent." By the late 1980s, the surge in her-oin from the Golden Cres-cent "had captured 60 percent of the US market."

The pattern of exploding narcotics trafficking would be repeated when the Reagan administration made the deci-sion to support anticommunist govern-ments and rebels in Central America. Between 1982 and 1985, covering the first Reagan term, the number of US co-caine users grew to 5.8 million, a 38 per-cent rise. During that period, the CIA and other agencies employed drug traf-fickers throughout Central America to assist their covert wars against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and guerril-las fighting to overthrow military and political dictatorships in El Salvador and Guatemala. Gen. Paul F. Gorman, former head of the US Southern Com-mand, captured the rationale for these unsavory alliances: "The fact is, if you want to go into the subversion business, collect intelligence, and move arms, you deal with drug movers."

It is critical to note that it was not just the CIA but the entire US foreign policy apparatus — including all branches of the military, the NSA, and the State Department — that helped implement the covert war against Nica-ragua and was complicit in the drug trafficking. Many of their activities were revealed in the investigations and hearings by Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) in the late 1980s. McCoy notes that the committee found, for example, that "The US State Department paid four contractors $806,401 to supply hu-manitarian aid to the Contra forces in Central America. All four of these com-panies were owned by known drug traf-fickers." The report went on to say that the State Department made "pay-ments to drug traffickers for hu-manitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted — on drug charges."

The committee's report was unambi-guous in assigning guilt: "On the basis of this evidence, it is clear that... ele-ments of the Contras... knowingly re-ceived financial and material assistance from drug traffickers.... In each case, one or another agency of the US government had in-formation about the in-volvement."

The Kerry report also concluded, "The logic of having drug money pay for the pressing needs of the Contras appealed to a number of people who became involved in the covert war. Indeed, senior US policy makers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contras' funding problems."

### Racism and the War On Drugs

The flood of drugs into the US, Contra-carried and other, had a devastatingim-pact on the black community; the harmful effects were only compounded by the "war on drugs" — pursued in turn by Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and Clin-ton— that disproportionately targeted African Americans.

That effect is consistent with a long history of drug wars that have, without exception, demonized communities of color as the main traffickers and users. In the 1880s, the growing Chinese American population was targeted by oppressive anti-opium legislation. While they were deported and impris-oned, whites comprised the largest group of users. They were mostly women who con-sumed great quantities of opium-based over-the-counter "tonics" and male Civil War veterans seeking pain relief. After opium was declared illegal, these white users were chan-neled into the medical rather than the criminal justice system.

The turn of the century "war on drugs" made co-caine the boogie monster, and the press was full of sensationalized stories about black men — crazed by the demon drug — who raped white women and committed horrible and de-praved crimes. The "re-sponsible" *New York Times* joined the chorus, at one point running a headline that blared "Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are a New Southern Menace," and reporting that southern sheriffs were forced to switch to higher caliber handguns to effec-tively stop drug-empowered blacks. There was, in fact, no evidence of a wave of cocaine-induced crime.

During the anti-marijuana wars of the 1930s, Mexican Americans were targeted at a time when they were mov-ing in large numbers into cities and competing for scarce jobs. Again the pa-pers were peppered with reports of drug-crazed attacks on innocent whites. The 1950s heroin war, which co-incided with the rise of the civil rights movement, followed the same pattern once again aimed against blacks.

"The drug war is always the pretext for something else," noted political ana-lyst Noam Chomsky. In the United States [it] "is basically a technique for controlling dangerous populations in-ternal to the country and doesn't have much to do with drugs." Politicians have long used it to excuse failed social and economic policies that have gener-ated unrest and as an expedient cam-paign issue. Richard Nixon took advantage of drug war rhetoric in the 1960s and early 1970s and set the stage for the ingenuous sloganeering cam-paigns of the 1980s. Then, while Nancy Reagan intoned "Just Say No [to drugs]," the president did just that to spending for social programs, aid to the cities, and most policies which had the potential to ameliorate conditions in the black community. President George Bush and his drug czar William Bennett continued the Reagan program with greater hyperbole but with no more effect in reducing trafficking or addiction, and Dole in his 1996 failed bid for the presidency unimaginatively varied the theme to "Just Don't Do It."

Meanwhile, in the 1980s and into the 1990s, the black community has been ravaged by a drug crisis of historic pro-portions, resulting in "crack" babies, re-cord drug overdoses, unprecedented numbers of black male youth incarcera-tions, a rise in AIDS, and numerous other harms. In Los Angeles County alone, according to the *Mercury News*, there are more than 70,000 children in foster care for drug-related reasons. In Washington, DC, of the thousands of cases of neglected and abused children removed from homes, 90 percent in-volved crack mothers. In fact, how-ever, most drug users are white, while a disproportionate number of people in-carcerated for a disproportionately greater number of years are black. Max-ine Waters (D-Calif.), who represents the Los Angeles district at the center of Blandon's and Ross' activi-ties, wrote Attorney General Janet Reno:

"In addition to the stress caused by crack cocaine use, I am also terribly disturbed by the heavy-handed, arbitrary, and discriminatory manda-tory minimum sentences which politicians have attached to crack co-caine use and possession. These sentences have the effect of severely pun-ishing small-time users, and are prosecuted in a discriminatory way which disproportion-ately impacts African American males."

### Policy Implications

It was into this context that the *San Jose Mercury News* story fell. One word characterizes the black com-munity's response: outrage. That reac-tion has sparked a mass movement of sorts to distribute the *Mercury News* se-ries as widely as possible and to force investigations into the allegations.

Black community leaders and activists are mobilizing around the issues raised. From Washington, DC to Cali-fornia, there have been protests, rallies, and forums. Howard University law students held a march and rally on the US Capitol steps. More than 1,500 showed up at a forum held by the Con-gressional Black Caucus on the issue. In Los Angeles, 1,000 turned out for a forum while 1,500 waited outside. Acti-vist Dick Gregory, radio host Joe Madison, activist Mark Thompson, and President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Rev. Joe Low-ery, have all been jailed for demonstrat-ing at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia or at the Justice Department. Gregory and Madison also have gone on hunger strikes.

Politicians are turning up the heat. In a letter to Attorney General Reno, Rep. Waters requested "a full and complete investigation into the connection between law en-forcement agencies, most particu-larly the CIA, and the early 1980s importation of crack cocaine. In ad-dition, I would like to know what ac-tions may have allowed these drug shipments to continue. I would also like to know the status of any efforts to investigate, punish, or prosecute those involved in this matter."

California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan have all written let-ters calling for an investigation. Rev. Jesse Jackson is demanding that Clin-ton order his Intelligence Oversight Board to conduct a full and independent investigation and calling for the release of all classified documents on the CIA's in-volvement in the Contra war, all DEA re-cords related to the Contras, and all DEA files on Meneses and Blandon.

While promising internal investiga-tions, the Department of Justice, CIA, and other US agencies all issued quick denials. At an October 23 Senate hear-ing, for example, CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz testified that based on the investigation up to that point, there is "no credible information" to support the *Mercury News'*stories.

### What Next?

The controversy around this issue un-derscores the necessity for black com-munity awareness and involvement in US foreign policy issues. The creation of the Contras was a policy initiative that emanated from the White House and was supported by policy makers. The fact that the policy was consistent, sus-tained, and sanctioned by the highest US officials is far more disturbing than any conspiracy theories about secret teams or rogue operations.

Black leaders must move beyond criticism of the Contra involvement in drug trafficking to questioning a for-eign policy that shows little regard for democratic processes or the interests of the poor and working people in the de-veloping world. It is not enough that those involved in drug dealing be brought to justice — an unlikely pros-pect at this point. What is essential is an overhaul of the mission and prac-tices of US intelligence agencies.

It is also time to renew the call for major reform of the nation's drug laws. The current laws and policing prac-tices are racially discriminatory in re-gard to arrest patterns, sentencing, imposition of mandatory minimums, crack-powder sentencing dis-crepancy, and punitive charac-ter of laws such as the "three strikes and you're out" provi-sions in a number of state and federal statutes.

It is also important to reiterate the demand that education and treatment access be given a higher priority in the federal drug budget. Under Reagan and Bush, 70 per-cent was aimed at law enforce-ment while only 30 percent was focused on education, prevention, and treatment. Under Clinton, two-thirds of the budget is still focused on law enforce-ment.

In this presidential election year, both parties played the game of who was toughest on crime, and neither raised concerns about increasing treatment mo-nies or the racialized nature of the na-tion's drug crisis and drug war. If the concerns raised by the *Mercury News* se-ries are to be answered, then these re-forms are only just the beginning.

### What They Knew & When They Knew It

#### The Crack-CIA-Contra Nexus

Testimony by Jack A. Blum
Former special counsel to the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations to Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Blum: Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate the invitation to appear here this morning. I find it ironic in a way that I'm here in the same room where we began hearings on the same subject... in January of 1988.

The answer you get to the question you ask depends totally on how you frame the question. If you ask the ques-tion, did the CIA sell drugs in the Black neighborhoods of Los Angeles to finance the Contra war, the answer will be a categorical no. The fact of the matter is we found no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there was a targeting of the African American community.

Cocaine in the mid '80s and into the early '90s was a perfect equal opportu-nity destroyer. We had addiction and problems in schoolyards across Amer-ica. It didn't matter what color you were, where you were from, what your national origin was. The problem be-came more acute in the African Ameri-can community because the definition of a problem addict in America is an ad-dict who runs out of money. And if you run out of money quickly, you become involved in the drug trade. You become a visible social problem. And you get on the screen. In fact, the stockbrokers, the entertainers, the lawyers who used co-caine around America escaped that at-tention, but their lives were ruined, too. Perhaps not financially.

The second issue is, did the CIA do the selling of the cocaine? And did the Contras profit? And as far as we were able to determine, no member of the staff of the CIA, that is someone on the payroll as opposed to people they work with, was in the cocaine business. And certainly no one on the staff of the CIA as far as we could determine, was ac-tively selling the drug.

And then finally the question of, was it used to support the Contras? I will tell you of two meetings that I had with Contra veterans, one in 1986 and one in 1989, at the beginning and the end of my investigation. And they said, our prob-lem was we never had any money. Our leadership stole most of it. They had houses in Miami. They had opportuni-ties to gamble. They had girlfriends. They traveled. And we, who were in the field, and one of the groups that I talked to had men who lost their arms and their eyes and their legs fighting the Sandinistas — we in the field had none of the benefit. So I submit what went on led to the profit of people in the Contra movement, not to supporting a war that we were trying to advance.

Now, having said that we have to go back to what is true. And what is true is the policy makers absolutely closed their eyes to the criminal behavior of our allies and supporters in that war. The policy makers ignored their drug deal-ing, their stealing, and their human rights violations. The policy-makers — and I stress policy-makers — allowed them to compensate themselves for helping us in that war by remaining si-lent in the face of their impropriety and by quietly undercutting law enforce-ment and human rights agencies that might have caused them difficulty.

We knew about the connection be-tween the West Coast cocaine trade and Contras. There was an astonishing case called the Frogman Case. In that case — I believe it was in that case — the United States attorney from San Fran-cisco, a man by the name of Russoniello, returned $35,000 of cocaine proceeds voluntarily to the Contras when it had been seized as proceeds of drug traffick-ing.... We had a telephone conversation with Mr. Russoniello, asking him to pro-vide us documents and access to the people involved in the case. And he shouted at us. He shouted at Senator John Kerry, who chaired the committee. He accused us of being subversive for wanting to go into it.

It should be stressed that the Blandon-Meneses ring was part of a very much larger picture. And to give you an idea of how large that picture was, there was a point where the wholesale price of cocaine on the street in Los Angeles reached $2,500 a kilo. We were talking about cocaine that was available in such quantity they could not find buyers. [that] is, below cost. And that is a flood of cocaine. And our friend "Freeway" Ricky [named in the San Jose Mercury article as the street level dealer who worked with the Contras] was touching only a tiny fraction of what was coming in. We had a definite cocaine epidemic.

Now, you might ask, why did... the hearings we ran in '88 and the report we released in 1989 not get more attention? And the answer is, we were subject to a systematic campaign to discredit every-thing we did. Every night after there was a public hearing, Justice Depart-ment people, administration people would get on the phone [and] call the press and say the witnesses were all liars, they were talking to us to get a better deal. That we were on a political ven-detta, that none of it was to be believed, and please don't cover it. ... It was a sys-tematic effort to discredit us that pre-vented the conclusions from receiving the attention I believe they warranted.

Now, I would argue that over a long period of years, covert operations were undertaken — and it's not only the CIA, obviously, the decision in that area is at a political level, and the CIA would be an implementing agency — were taken on an ideological basis that verged on religious belief, and with an eye to short-term results and not long-term conse-quences. Never again should that kind of ideological blindness and short-term vision infect intelligence assessments.

In the 1980s, all of us could count the number of people dead on the streets of America as a result of the drug problem. You couldn't find me a single person in America who had died as a result of an attack by a Sandinista inside our borders.

There should have been some ability to notice that distinction and under-stand the importance of the drug prob-lem and understand that that had to be addressed and, at the very least, that anything you did to solve any other for-eign policy problem not make the drug problem worse.

I think that among the other things you should be looking at is a review of the relationship in gen-eral between covert op-erations and criminal or-ganizations. The two go together like love and marriage.... Criminal or-ganizations are perfect allies in a covert opera-tion.... They know who the corrupt government officials are, and they have them on the pay-roll. They'll do any-thing I want for money. It's a terrific working partnership. The problem is that they then get empowered by the fact that they work with us. So now they have stature and influence and impact on their country. And if they have influ-ence with politicians and people who come to power, we now have a new power-ful criminal enterprise, and we can't al-ways control what they do once we stand down. And unfortunately, we have yet to figure out how to prevent criminal friends from becoming an albatross.

There's a second problem, and that is when you run covert operations, you train people in a lot of skills,... [and] once you've bitten the apple of knowledge, you can't unlearn it, ever. And when you teach people how to change their iden-tity, how to hide from the law, how to build bombs, how to assassinate people, they don't forget how to do it. And you wind up, after the covert action is over, with a disposal problem. [Blum briefly describes the history of the relation be-tween drug trafficking and covert ops from the '50s with the Kuomintang army, to the Vietnam War to Afghanistan. For a fuller treatment, see pp. 53-59.]

### Untrue North

Now, to turn specifically to the Latin American story and where our inves-tigation picks up on the drug trail. We had testimony from a man who was a civilian employee of Argentine mili-tary intelligence, Liandro Sanchez Ris. [phonetic spelling - ed.] He told us that the United States had encouraged the Argentine military to act as proxy for the United States during the Carter administration because we had a pub-lic policy of supporting human rights and another policy of really trying to sustain our anticommunist efforts.

And the Argentines, he said, spon-sored the cocaine coup in Bolivia and then set up a money-laundering opera-tion in Fort Lauderdale.... And, indeed, he had set up that operation. He used the money-laundering operation in Fort Lauderdale to provide funds to the Argentines all over Latin America who were in the business of "fighting com-munism." We should remember it was the Argentines who were the original trainers of the Contras. They were the ones who brought the original Contras to Honduras [and] Guatemala and began to teach them how to do what they had to do against the Sandinista government.

Sanchez Ris told us that he believed that the reason the Argentines were so willing to go to war with the British over the Falklands was that the Argen-tine generals seriously thought that the assistance they had given us, the covert assistance they had given us, was going to put them in our good graces to the point where we would side with them — a tragic mistake indeed if he was correct.

The second man who turned up on our screen very big time was General Nori-ega. And, as you'll recall,... Noriega was on our payroll. The accounts we heard were that he was getting paid some $200,000 a year by the United States government. At the time that was going on, virtually everybody who dealt with him knew he was in the drug business. It was an open secret. In fact, it was so open it appeared on the front page of the *New York Times* in June of 1986. I testi-fied about it in a closed session of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1986.

We have, as the absolute low point of the Contra War, Ollie North having a meeting with General Noriega. And he recorded that meeting in great detail in his notebooks in which he's bargaining with Noriega. Noriega says to him, "I've got this terrible public relations prob-lem over drugs. What can you do to help me?" [Noriega replies) "Here's what I'll do to help you. I'll assassinate the entire Sandinista leadership. I'll blow up build-ings in Managua." Ollie doesn't call the cops. What Ollie does is he goes back to Poindexter, and Poindexter says, "Gee, that's a little bit extreme. Can't you get 'em to tone it down? Go back and meet with 'em again." Which Ollie does.

When our committee asked the Gen-eral Accounting Office to do a step-by-step analysis of just who in our government knew that General Nori-ega was dealing drugs, and when they knew it, and what they did to act on that knowledge, the administration told every agency of the government not to cooperate with GAO, labeled it a na-tional security matter, and swept it into the White House and cloaked it in ex-ecutive privilege. That investigation never went forward, should have gone forward. I was very much dismayed.

Our committee subpoenaed Ollie North's notebooks. And the history of those notebooks is quite astonishing. Not many people realize this, but the Senate never got a clean copy of those notebooks. North's lawyers were per-mitted to expurgate sections of the notebooks based on "relevance."... And we engaged in a ten-month battle to get them. And ultimately the investigation ended, the subcommittee's mandate ended, we never got them. ... The note-books in their entirety are still not public, and my belief is that your committee, the Intelligence Committee, should un-dertake at the earliest opportunity a complete investigation of the notebook situation and do your best to make it public to restore some degree of confi-dence in the process.

### Criminal Behavior

Now, the problem of General Noriega and Ollie North's notebooks and what was in them is only [one] of a number of prob-lems related to this war and related to drug trafficking that we stumbled into. We had problems in Haiti, where friends of ours, that is, intelligence sources in the Haitian military, had turned their facili-ties, their ranches and their farms over to drug traffickers. Instead of putting pressure on that rotten leadership of the Haitian military, we defended them. We held our noses. We looked the other way. And they and their criminal friends distributed, through a variety of networks, cocaine in the United States, in Miami, in Philadelphia, in New York, in parts of Pennsylvania.

Honduras was another country that was key for the Contras. Honduras was the base of Contra operations. Most of the Contra supplies came through Hon-duras. We wanted to do nothing to em-barrass the Honduran military. Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a member of the gang that was involved in the Camarena murder, went to Honduras and found refuge there. He was walking in the streets of Tegucigalpa, openly and publicly. The response of the United States government was to close the DEA office in Honduras and move the agents stationed there to Guate-mala. We took testimony from that DEA agent. He said it made no sense. The drug trafficking was going on in Hondu-ras. And the Honduran military were at the center of it.... But we sat by as long as they were helping us and allowed them to carry on their illegal business.

We also became aware of deep con-nections between the law enforcement community and the intelligence com-munity. I personally repeatedly heard from prosecutors and people in the law enforcement world that CIA agents were required to sit in on the debriefing of various people who were being ques-tioned about the drug trade. They were required to be present when witnesses were being prepped for certain drug tri-als.... At various times the intelligence community inserted itself in that legal process. I believe that that was an im-propriety, that that should not have oc-curred. [Asked by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) if he was "suggesting that the intelligence community thwarted or stopped prosecutions which should have gone forward," Blum replied] That too; that too.

When there were criminal cases that threatened to expose various covert op-erations in the region, those criminals would be then put aside for one reason or another. And there was a procedure for doing that within the Department of Justice. We attempted to probe that procedure. The Department of Justice rebuffed us rather systematically. We had some conversations with one of the Justice Department officials involved and took his deposi-tion. But we were never able to get really satisfactory responses to the questions we asked.

We do know that Ollie North directly intervened in a number of cases to help people who had helped the covert war.

### Looking the Other Way

There was a flip side to this drug problem as well. One of the favored techniques of vari-ous people in this operation was, whenever there was someone they didn't like, they would label him a drug trafficker.

We ran into the case of Ron Martin who had set up an arms warehouse in Tegu-cigalpa, Honduras, and he did it at the request of various friends of his in the US government and it was sort of a pre-posi-tioning of weapons to help the Contras. And the idea was that when the ban on direct aid was lifted, his stuff could be sold.

Ron Martin was a potential competi-tion of the Secord-North supply net-work. North started telling everyone that the Martin warehouse was financed by cocaine, not to deal with it. And the impact was to destroy Ron Martin fi-nancially. So this became a matter of af-firmative and negative use.

I would say, based on my experience with this affair and my look at the long history of our covert operations dealing with criminals and drug dealers, that this entire affair needs a thorough review, a historical review as well as the narrow review of the issues posed by the article in the *San Jose Mercury*. The problem as I see it is, if you go to bed with dogs, you get up with fleas. If you empower criminals because empowering them hap-pens to be helpful at the time, the crimi-nals are sure to turn on you next.

The most important loss that we had as a result of the covert war in Central America was the loss of public trust in the honesty and integrity of the people who run America's clandestine opera-tions.... We had people in the Contra movement, southern front Contras, and indeed there is a television, a video deposition of one of them, who says look, I discussed the problem of the drug dealing among our number with my case officer. And he told me... This is a Contra leader. He was a member of the Contra directorate. We took his deposition in video form, in San Jose, Costa Rica.... He told us that he had dis-cussed the drug problem and his case officer said look, there is nothing we can do about it.... [Asked by Specter, "what kind of a case officer," Blum replied] CIA. [Asked if "you're saying is that the CIA individual did not stop them from dealing in drugs," Blum replied:] Right.

[After saying he did not believe the CIA encouraged the Contras to sell drugs, Blum added] Now, there's one other thing you have to understand about the situation in Central America at the time. And it's relevant to the question you asked. There were facili-ties that were needed for running the war. Clandestine airstrips. Cowboy pi-lots who would fly junker airplanes. People who would make arrangements for the clandestine movement of money. Every one of those facilities was a per-fect facility for someone in the drug business. So there [were] people who were connected very directly to the CIA who had those facilities, and allowed them to be used, and indeed personally profited from their use as drug traffick-ing.... It's not that someone from the CIA permitted them to be used. It's that a contract employee had the facilities. He was doing a job. That job wasn't de-livering drugs for the CIA.

The point is that this was going on in tandem with the war. And the people who were organizing it from our side saw all of it. In fact, you had to be blind not to see it. And instead of trying to stop it or say, "Wait a minute, we really ought to change our policy here, or re-think how we're doing it," they went for-ward and said, "We're going to solve the problem with the Sandinistas, and the devil take this other set of issues."

### Ban Covert Ops?

[Asked by Specter if "Con-gress as a matter of public policy ought to ban covert operations," Blum replied] I think that there may in some circumstances, des-perate matters of national urgency, be some kind of ar-gument for them. But I will say that in my experience we have rarely considered the blowback, we have rarely considered the long-term political consequence. And if you look at the kind of catastrophic record that the operations that got us tangled up in the drug business led to, I would say they failed. Remember, we lost the war in Nicaragua. Remember that our dear friends in the Argentine military disappeared thousands of people. Look at the horrible, brutal reality of Pino-chet's Chile. And ask what kind of threat there was to the United States that warranted that kind of behavior. Here's my problem. I think that if people in the government of the United States make a secret decision to sacri-fice some portion of the American popu-lation, in the form of exposing them let's say — deliberately exposing them to drugs, that is a terrible decision that should never be made in secret. [Af-ter explaining that he didn't think that had been the case, Blum returned to a discussion of when or if covert operations are justified.]

There was a judgment call here. And that judgment call erred so far on the wrong side of where judgment should have been that we wound up with a ter-rible problem. And that terrible prob-lem was a de facto result that I was describing; that is, where many people did suffer as a consequence.

And I started to say, when DEA al-lows a controlled delivery of drugs, there is a furious debate. Those control-led deliveries are monitored because DEA says, our job is to prevent it from coming in. And if it escapes on the street, for any reason, we've blown it. And that kind of standard is really the kind of standard that should have, I think, been applied here. And maybe you can give me — and maybe we would both agree, that there is some dreadful circumstance where this should have occurred and been allowed to occur and so on. And I probably could be convinced in the right set of circum-stances. But the problem was that that issue wasn't put that way. And the sen-sitivity to what was going on was sim-ply missing.

### Who Killed George Polk: The Press Covers Up A Death in the Family

by Elias Vlanton with Zak Mettger

TEMPLE UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1996, ENDNOTES, BIBLIOGRAPHY, INDEX, 322 PP., $27.95 HB.

Nearly five decades have passed since a Greek fisherman pulled the body of CBS Middle East correspondent George Polk out of Salonika Bay. Polk had been bound and blindfolded, shot in the back of the head, and dumped, still alive, into the water. Because of his re-porting on corruption and human rights abuses in the Greek government's civil war against communist partisans, the re-gime and its right-wing allies were the prime suspects in his murder.

Under great pressure from the Tru-man administration to solve the case, the Greeks quickly convicted one man — whom they painted as a communist rebel. The US government and an ad hoc, high-profile journalists' group, the Lippmann Committee, pronounced it-self satisfied that the crime had been solved and the Greek communists were responsible. With few exceptions, the US journalistic community agreed, and the Polk Affair, which had threatened to derail the fledgling US aid program to Greece, faded from the front pages.

Over the years, various authors have challenged the official version and of-fered alternate theories about who re-ally murdered George Polk and why. The cast of suspects includes the Greek right wing, the CIA, British intelli-gence, and Greek or US profiteers. At first glance, yet another book on the Polk Affair appears gratuitous, but Greek-American writer and researcher Elias Vlanton has produced the defini-tive study. Relying on extensive re-search in the State Department archives, contemporary press reports, interviews, and other archival materi-als, Vlanton demolishes the official story. He also tells the tale of a craven US press establishment that kowtowed to US foreign policy imperatives in-stead of pursuing the truth.

In 1948, the birth of the Cold War, Greece was the frontline of the US anti-communist crusade. Communist guer-rillas who had fought the Nazis during World War II now battled right-wing Greek Royalists for the country's fu-ture. President Truman, determined to foil "communist expansionism," an-nounced the Truman Doctrine, and the US began pouring millions of dollars into Greece. Vlanton shows how the ad-ministration counted on the press to play a vital role in manufacturing sup-port for its new, interventionist policy.

He also shows how the press largely complied. Along the way, Vlanton illu-minates the unseemly relationship be-tween the press and the US government. Although some of Polk's comrades in the Newspaper Guild at-tempted to initiate an independent in-vestigation, moves by establishment press luminaries led by Walter Lippmann undercut their effort. In-stead, the Lippmann Committee (whose general counsel was Col. Bill Donovan, former head of the CIA's predecessor, the OSS) agreed to monitor the Greek investigation. With State Department and other records, Vlanton exposes the close collaboration between the US Em-bassy in Athens and the Lippmann Committee.

Vlanton does not cry conspiracy, nor does he claim US involvement in Polk's death. What he does argue, quite con-vincingly, is that the US government and the establishment press shared funda-mental assumptions about the Cold War and the critical importance of the Greek anticommunist struggle. For both, solving Polk's murder was less im-portant than resolving it. Similarly, the Greek regime used the Polk Affair to ad-vance on two fronts: It pleased and ap-peased its sponsor, and scored a propaganda victory against its commu-nist foes. What both the Greeks and the Americans wanted was to quickly dis-pose of this looming scandal; justice for George Polk came in a distant second.

Vlanton and coauthor Zak Mettger provide a minute-by-minute account of Polk's peregrinations before his death, the Greek government's investigation, the lone trial in the case, and the flurry of US diplomatic activity designed to keep the lid on. They do so with pa-nache; the book reads as much like a thriller as a historical investigation. They also evaluate earlier theories of Polk's murder (and find them wanting) and pre-sent their own, based on documents un-covered during Vlanton's research.

Every year, the US journalistic com-munity presents the George Polk award for "the best in American journalism" (last year's winner was Alan Nairn). But, as Vlanton makes achingly clear, "the best in American journalism" did much less than their best when it came to uncovering Polk's killers.

### The Laundrymen: Inside Money Laundering, The World's Third-Largest Business

by Jeffrey Robinson

ARCADE PRESS, 1996, BIBLIOGRAPHY, INDEX, 358 PP., $25.95 HB.

In its unending war against "interna-tional crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism," the US legal system has proven ingenious at creating new crimes with which to snare its targets. Criminal syndicalism ordinances begat conspiracy prosecutions begat RICO. Now, money laundering laws are prose-cutors' latest statutory weapon. Having defined the failure to report certain fi-nancial transactions to federal authorities as a crime, the feds are understandably eager to glamorize their tactics.

They have found their messenger in Jeffrey Robinson, a professional writer (he also wrote books on Brigitte Bardot and Grace Kelly), who seems to have talked exclusively to bankers, cops, and prosecutors. Unsurprisingly, Robinson suffers from the tendency to identify with the protagonists of his book, the law enforcers.

Still, he knows how to spin a tale as he relates the money-laundering schemes of such varied scoundrels as Heidi Fleiss, Saddam Hussein, Richard Nixon, and the Cali Cartel. He also clarifies the nuts and bolts: the shell companies, off-the-shelf banks, false in-voicing ruses, and the rest. In the end, writes Robinson, the enforcers are fighting a losing battle. Bankers and governments worldwide scramble to make sure some of the estimated sev-eral hundred billion dollars in laun-dered funds each year sticks to their fingers. Even worse, he writes, new technologies such as "cybercash" will soon leave the launderers further ahead.

As a popular overview, *The Laundry-men* serves well, but as a serious study it has problems, not least its failure to source sometimes incredible claims. Al-though Robinson has compiled an im-pressive bibliography, he forgoes footnotes and frequently omits sources in the text. The reader can thus only wonder where he heard, for instance, that "the North Vietnamese used drugs as an effective weapon in the guerrilla war" against the US, or that hundreds of East European Communist officials raked in fortunes from drug trafficking. Perhaps such anecdotes are more than apocryphal, but *The Laundrymen* won't help you find out.

More likely, such sweeping claims, along with similar unsourced tales about Nicaragua, Cuba, the IRA, and other US demons, reveal the author's sympathies. Such biases also color Ro-binson's portrayal of European bankers as somehow soft because they refuse to go along with the US. Similarly, his im-mersion in fed-culture leads him to sug-gest that only applying the death penalty to bankers, attorneys, and bro-kers as well as international dope deal-ers might cure the problem. And even he admits that probably wouldn't work.

### The Militarization of the US-Mexico Border, 1978-1992: Low-Intensity Conflict Doctrine Comes Home

by Timothy J. Dunn

CMAS BOOKS/UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS PRESS, 1996, ENDNOTES, BIBLIOGRAPHY, INDEX, 307 PP., $14.95 PB.

The US-Mexico border has been con-tested terrain, both geographically and symbolically, ever since the Mexi-can-American War ended in 1848. As Timothy Dunn points out, it took the US Army, National Guard, and Texas Rangers to subdue Mexicano discon-tent along the Rio Grande until the 1920s. Relative tranquility reigned un-til the 1960s when Chicano nationalism emerged from the fields and barrios of the Southwest. Once again, the border looms large in US domestic politics, marking the frontier between apple-pie America and the Third World menace.

As Dunn perceptively notes, control-ling the human traffic across the border serves primarily to regulate labor flows for the benefit of US business. But such functions are not discussed in main-stream political discourse. Instead, the border becomes a symbolic locus for US phobias about security and identity. "Here, two of the hottest hot-button issues — immigration and drug traf-ficking — provide politicians the oppor-tunity to outbid one another as protectors of "the American way of life." Amid the posturing and symbolism, however, the push to tighten the lid on the border pro-duces real effects on the ground.

In detailing those effects, Dunn takes a fresh, unconventional, and ulti-mately rewarding approach. The Uni-versity of Texas sociologist views efforts to control the border through the prism of low-intensity conflict doctrine (LIC). After all, Dunn argues, although LIC was designed as a counterinsurgency strat-egy against Third World revolutionar-ies, enforcement measures along the border fit well within its parameters. Trends toward an increasingly para-military Border Patrol, the coordina-tion of police and military functions, the use of military equipment, and, most dis-turbingly, the doctrinal blind spot toward human rights abuses are all present.

Since 1992, the end of the period un-der his gaze, the pace of militarization has quickened dramatically. The size of the Border Patrol doubled in the 15 years of Dunn's study; it will double again under the new immigration bill. Similarly, coordinated state-local-fed-eral law enforcement efforts have mul-tiplied, and are expanding eastward.

### American Militias: Rebellion, Racism, and Religion

by Richard Abanes

INTER VARSITY PRESS, 1996, ENDNOTES, BIBLIOG-RAPHY, INDEX, 296 PP., $25.95 HB.

More than two years after the Okla-homa City bombing, the militias continue to make headlines. Before the Olympics, some Georgia militiamen were caught playing with dynamite, and this summer, the FBI and ATF busted the Ari-zona Viper militia for allegedly plotting to blow up parts of downtown Phoenix. In October, the West Virginia Mountaineer Militia went down in another alleged plot, this time to destroy the FBI's finger-print headquarters.

The militia phenomenon has like-wise spurred a publishing cottage in-dustry including a frenzy of reprints of decade-old works on militia precursors such as the Order and the Posse Comi-tatus. This year, professional militia-watchers Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Kenneth Stern of the ADL contributed worried tomes calling for tougher laws and stricter law enforcement. Anti-racist activist Mike Novick's *White Lies, White Power* also raised the alarm but cautioned not to rely on the state to fight the fringe right.

Like the other militia-related books, Richard Abanes' *American Militias* points to the Waco-Ruby Ridge-Brady Bill trinity as sparking the movement. He also agrees that the pivotal Estes Park, Colorado, meeting cemented the unholy alliance among white suprema-cists, Christian Identity followers, and "angry white guys." Similarly, all provide portraits of key militia figures and trace the connections among the different com-ponents of the militia movement.

Abanes separates himself from the pack on several counts. His nuanced ex-ploration of the lengthy conspiracy pedigree behind such militia bugaboos as the New World Order, the black heli-copters, and the international bankers is especially illuminating. Abanes traces modern conspiracy thought back to foes of the French Revolution, who in turn used the template provided by the blood libels against the Jews in early and medieval Europe. Along the way, he demolishes one by one the current myths of the militia movement.

Similarly, Abanes, founder and di-rector of the Religious Information Center of Southern California, is alone in adequately explaining the tenets of Christian Identity, the racist, apocalyp-tic dogma adapted by Randy Weaver, the Aryan Nations, and a significant — if unknown — portion of the militia movement. And it is here that Abanes has a point to make: Christian Identity is not, he says, a Christian denomina-tion. Citing chapter and verse, Abanes takes great pains to separate the hate-filled racism of Pastor Pete Peters and his ilk from the fellowship of main-stream Christianity. Along the way, he takes some well-deserved pokes at con-servative Christians such as Pat Robertson and militia members and leaders. He shows how they willfully ig-nore or, at best, fail to confront the hate-ful heresies of Christian Identity.

Abanes has an ax to grind, but it is a worthy one. And on the way to the grind-stone, he has produced an exhaustively documented, smoothly written, and ex-cellent portrait of a phenomenon.
