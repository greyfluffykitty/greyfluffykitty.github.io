# 'Stop the Steal' Was a Donald Trump Fans' War Cry Even Before Election Day  [1]
## _Trump had no grand plan and no interest in mapping out what to do if the dog actually caught the car_
The slogan Stop the Steal was already emerging on election night, even as the votes were still being counted.

Donald Trump was upbeat as polls started to close on November 3. He had locked up 210 electoral college votes and 23 states in the race against former Vice President Joe Biden. As the evening unfolded, many White House aides were giddy with excitement. TV analysts, though, were saying that Biden voters who were less predisposed to vote in person would swing the vote in many states once the unprecedented number of mail-in ballots was counted. And then, at 11:20 p.m., Fox News called Arizona for Biden. The West Wing was stunned. And the news would get worse; Biden would accumulate 81 million votes, seven million more than Trump. How would Donald Trump respond to the loss? That was on everyone's minds, from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. The president had been telling crowds for months that the election was rigged. There was no telling what the man would do: refuse to leave office, even declare Martial Law.

No one projected in early November what would happen two months later, and for all the claims being made today that the January 6 riot was pre-planned and well-organized, no one had yet begun to plan or conceive of a march on the Capitol, let alone an assault.

No one projected, and no one anticipated the ferocity of the demonstrations, even up to the eleventh hour. It is a story of many of the same intelligence failures as 9/11—not connecting the dots and focusing on the wrong things; pointing fingers and laying blame.Inside the highest reaches of the national security agencies, the fear that President Trump could do the worst led to the most unusual coup in American history. Right after the election, the president fired many of his Pentagon and homeland security leaders. Attorney General William Barr stepped off the stage. And so General Milley and the permanent national security establishment took over, ultimately ignoring and even conspiring against the commander-in-chief "for the good of the nation"—a satisfying result for many Americans but also a warning of a dysfunction that still grips the country one year later.

The federal domestic agencies, operating more or less autonomously with little input from the White House, also became tangled and blinded in their laser-like focus on some things and obliviousness of others. That cast of characters is vast: 23 federal agencies including the U.S. Capitol Police, U.S. Park Police, FBI, Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, ATF and the U.S. Marshals. They were joined by the Metropolitan Police Department and Metro Transit Police and police officers from Maryland and Virginia.

The collision of definitions and jurisdictions is almost comic. Why wasn't January 6th declared a National Security Special Event, which would have triggered an automatic state of alert and a federal force? Because it wasn't "national security," some in government say. Because it wasn't "special": the electoral count, they have argued, is a regular and scheduled event. (In fact, State of the Union addresses and Democratic and Republican conventions—even the state funeral of George H.W. Bush—were National Security Special Events.) Because the governor has to ask for the declaration, they say. In the District of Columbia there is no governor, and the powers of the mayor are significantly circumscribed. Because the mayor only "asked" for so many supporting troops. Because Capitol Hill itself is sovereign Congressional territory. Because the Ellipse and the National Mall are under Park Service control. Because the Secret Service was focused on Vice President Mike Pence's safety and continuity of government. Because, despite abundant chatter and even evidence, no one thought the crowd would be so big.

Somehow in all of this, the very homeland security organizations created in the wake of 9/11 were absent. This includes the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Northern Command (the military command set up after 9/11 to defend the homeland). Two subordinate Washington area military commands—Joint Forces Headquarters National Capital Region and Joint Task Force National Capitol Region—already active because of COVID, played no role.

And yet at the same time, lurking in the shadows, was the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team and other special operations components of both the Justice Department and the Pentagon, all of them deployed to Washington for the possibility of a catastrophic event on January 6th, an incongruity where the left hand was preparing for the very worst while the right hand was working on a contingency no more severe that some symbolic march on the Capitol.There was also the National Guard, a controversial absentee that Congress and the commissions and news media have argued about for the past year. Why weren't they moved more quickly? No one predicted the violence until it was too late, and the Pentagon, skittish, did not want to see troops in the streets. They had been soundly criticized for the military's presence during the George Floyd and racial justice protests in June. The brass also feared what Trump might do, never volunteering any resources that weren't the minimum.

The overarching problem, though, was that no agency of government understood who the protestors were. Thus there was no meaningful intelligence warning. No one understood the actual threat to the country they were pledged to protect. When the day came, it was not too late for warning signs.

But the notion that the military would have made a difference is also fallacious and dangerous. There were all of 150 Guardsmen and Guardswomen ready on January 6th. The number of staff officers in Washington intelligence and command centers exceeded that number by a ratio of thousands to one. And even if there were thousands of troops, did anyone really want to see the battleground turned into a battlefield, where guns do the talking? And then there was the effect of COVID itself. One-hundred-thousand new cases were reported for the first time in a single day on November 4th, the day after the election. New records continued to be broken during the month as cases surpassed 11 million and Americans were urged to stay home for Thanksgiving. A significant group of anti-government and conspiratorial naysayers emerged in 2020, many of them already in the ranks of the disbelieving. (And they are still 30 percent of the population, three out of every ten adults.)

And though it might not have seemed so crucial to the January 6th story at the time, when COVID hit the White House just days after the election, it took two of Trump's key advisors out of the picture, and it sent chief of staff Mark Meadows home for two weeks. The country's leadership was a man watching television and tweeting, his circle of advisors increasingly shrunk to a handful of true believers (and eventually down to a circle of one with Rudy Giuliani). The so-called "adults in the room"—the cabinet, his national security advisor, his own son-in-law—absented themselves.

Vice President Pence emerged as an unlikely (and very lonely) hero. The institution that really proved itself was the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, plus the men and women of the Capitol Police who actually attempted to hold the line—not the leadership.

And then there were the protestors themselves, the MAGA army, some 50 organizations that descended on Washington in a crowd for which there is no established estimate of its size. There were extremist groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters: according to many analysts since, a small seditious band of insurrectionists that hid in a civilian crowd.

On January 6th, about 1,200 people mounted the violent assault or entered the Capitol Building, many of them swept forward with the crowd. That was perhaps two percent of the total of some 100,000 protestors. That leaves 98 percent who are now largely ignored—a vast misunderstood segment of the American public. Who were they? Why were they there in the first place? What do they represent in the broader American society.

A year after the events of January 6, the appetite to rehash the election and its aftermath is as great as ever, with each side convinced that it is saving America. Half the country remains glued to the Donald Trump show, incensed by everything he does. Half believes the election was stolen in some way and they focus their hatred on Joe Biden. They are contemptuous of the Democrats, the liberals, the elite, the news media, and "the swamp" in Washington. They are the force that elected Donald Trump in 2016 and came close in 2020. They didn't just materialize after the 2020 election.

As election night closed, the always impulsive, improvisational president pivoted in the only direction he understood, to continue the Trump show. He had no grand plan and no interest in mapping out what to do if the dog actually caught the car. In the end, Donald Trump would no longer be president. But the show would be renewed—and the cliffhanger of what he would do would hold the audience in thrall.
# Fox News Called Arizona for Biden, Turning January 6 Into the Day of Reckoning [2]

Protestors in Arizona, many in MAGA costume carrying blue Trump-Pence signs and waving Trump flags, converged on the Maricopa County Recorder's Office, the local vote counting center, on November 4. Rep. Paul Gosar, who represented Arizona's 4th District, showed up. Mike Cernovich, an alt-right media gadfly and originator of the Pizzagate conspiracy, drove in from California. Members of the Arizona Patriots Movement were spotted in the crowd. The news media reported the presence of QAnon supporters. The crowd shouted "Fox News Sucks" in protest of the network calling Arizona in Joe Biden's favor. "They're not going to steal this election from us, are they?" Gosar yelled into the crowd.There was a lot of talk about SharpieGate, an alleged Democratic Party plot to steal the election from Donald Trump. The rumor was that ballots in Arizona filled out with Sharpies, the pen favored by the president and thus used by his supporters, were not being read by the vote-scanning machines. Actual voters testified to this story.

Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union tweeted about a stolen election. Trump's sons followed. The claim popped up on TikTok and 4Chan and other social media sites favored by Trumpers.As the protest grew, CNN reported that the protestors were "right wing" and that SharpieGate was "misinformation." Politico labeled it all "baseless conspiracy." Protestors were not "citing evidence," said The New York Times. Some of the protestors, Reuters said, were armed with "rifles and handguns."
"I won't accept a Biden victory," one protestor told the Times. "I don't want to live under Communist rule."
As the protests in Arizona unfolded, anti-Trump social media filled with counter-protests. One commenter said that good people—many elderly—were counting the votes and that they shouldn't be harassed. Donald Trump incited this mob, one commenter said. It's not an uprising but an organized protest, said another.

As the protests in Arizona unfolded, anti-Trump social media filled with counter-protests. One commenter said that good people—many elderly—were counting the votes and that they shouldn't be harassed. Donald Trump incited this mob, one commenter said. It's not an uprising but an organized protest, said another. The voting machines themselves came under suspicion. There was talk that the Supreme Court would intervene. Soon an increasing number of tweets were labeled false information and flagged, and users on Facebook were suspended and even barred. In a reversal of the usual positions, many progressive and liberal Democrats began to applaud censorship. They called on the police to do more or clamored for the military to intervene. Many of those who opposed Trump had, 20 years earlier, shouted "Not my president" to protest George W. Bush's controversial win over Al Gore.

"Why do these people get to stand around, terrorize, and interfere with an important part of American democracy, while those protesting racial injustice have rubber bullets and tear gas launched at them???'" one post said. "So where's the national guard oh yea their all white," said another. A key word used by both sides was "they." "They" believed the election was rigged or alternatively "they" dismissed their foes as brainwashed nutjobs. Some of the protestors in Arizona made their way into the offices to inquire about the count before being asked to leave, which they peacefully did. The crowd grew. Another protest commenced at the State Capitol. Count all ballots, they demanded in Arizona. But in Michigan on November 4th, protestors chanted "stop the count." Mail-in ballots, now potentially responsible for deciding the next president, had become the hanging chad of 2020: even after votes were cast and counted and certified, the actual election became just one day in a continuum. 

What the anti-Trumpers missed was that November 3rd was never an absolute end for pro-Trumpers because Donald Trump's election in 2016 was never the beginning. There was vast misunderstood class in American society—disgruntled with the elite, the news media and with Washington—that elected Trump in the first place.The battleground became January 6th, the day that Congress would accept the electoral votes as transmitted from each state recorder's office. Finally, the hard core believed, finally the people would be heard. One commenter on the Washington Post wrote on November 4: "Into the good night they should gently disappear chanting 'We were cheated' because they were, just not by whom they thought."

# 'I'm Going to War; I'm Bringing the Big Cock,' Posted a Trump Fan. The FBI Didn't Notice [3]

On Thursday, November 5, a grand jury returned a five-count indictment against Hawazen Sameer Mothafar, a Troutdale, Oregon, 31-year-old charged with material support to ISIS and lying to federal authorities. For years, the Justice Department said, Mothafar directly produced, edited and distributed articles and tutorials about how to carry out attacks on behalf of ISIS, working directly for its media branch. He'd also been involved in a plot to kill the president of Mauritania.

FBI Special Agent in charge of the investigation Renn Cannon said that Mothafar's online propaganda on behalf of ISIS sought to incite "lone actors"—including potential terrorists in the United States. "When it comes to cases like this one, a computer and a keyboard can be powerful weapons against enemies of the Islamic State," Cannon said. "This defendant is a legal permanent resident of the United States who abandoned the country that took him in and instead pledged allegiance to ISIS and repeatedly and diligently promoted its violent objectives," said U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams. "Our national security prosecutors and law enforcement partners will continue to ensure that those who threaten our country are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." In fact, a threat to the country—to the peaceful transfer of power, a matter of national pride and stability for 200 years—was already taking shape, and ISIS had nothing to do with it.

"I'm going to war," Christopher Joseph Quaglin said on Facebook on November 5. "I'm bringing the big cock," he wrote, evidently referring to a rifle. "I'm really ready to just the [sic] kamikaze." He was later arrested for storming the Capitol on January 6.

"It's time for fucking War if they steal this shit," said Ethan Nordean on social media the same day, a Proud Boys leader who would also be arrested for attacking the Capitol.

And then there was Steve Bannon, who on his podcast said he wanted to behead Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI director Christopher Wray and "put the heads on pikes ... as a warning to federal bureaucrats."

And where was the FBI? If potential terrorists—if people at their keyboards—were surveilled and arrested for their behavior, where was the FBI when it came to the right-wing extremists who were harassing and intimidating in their public and private statements? Where was the attention on pro-Trump Americans who intended to inflict violence? There was none.

"This mobilization was not hidden away in the dead of night," notes the Trial Memorandum of the impeachment trial of President Trump. "It was widely discussed on websites—such as TheDonald.win ... These sites hosted hundreds of posts about plans for the attack on the Capitol, with detailed discussions of weaponry and directions to 'find the tunnels and 'arrest the worst traitors.'"

Steven A. Sund, the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police who would resign after January 6, admitted after the assault, "Although it appears that there were numerous participants from multiple states planning this attack, the entire intelligence community (IC) seems to have missed it."

"The federal Intelligence Community—led by FBI and DHS—did not issue a threat assessment warning of potential violence targeting the Capitol," said the first Congressional report examining the attacks.

Evidently, neither the FBI nor homeland security saw repeated online posts and statements calling for violence at the Capitol as "credible." In testimony before Congress, representatives from both agencies said they considered much of the rhetoric online prior to January 6 as "First Amendment protected speech."

You might think the Bureau's lack of attention to domestic threats was due to being overextended, or a post-9/11 focus on foreign groups and Islamic individuals such as Mothafar. But you would be wrong.

By late 2020, the number of arrests and indictments for these types of terrorism cases had sharply declined from previous years. It might have been the result of successful FBI work or a temporary decline due to COVID, but either way, between Election Day and January 6, the Bureau announced just 12 international-terrorism-related arrests, indictments and sentences. Of almost 1,200 press releases issued during that time period, 289 related to fraud or money laundering, 111 to child exploitation, 87 to illegal drugs, 75 to human trafficking, and 54 to bank robbery.

Only five FBI releases related to domestic terrorism. That included William Garfield Bilbrough IV, a Maryland resident, "a member of the racially motivated violent extremist group 'The Base,'" who was sentenced to five years in prison on December 8. "Bilbrough and his cohorts intended to inflict violence on the basis of their racist and hateful beliefs," the U.S. Attorney said. And there was Cameron Emerson Casey Rankin, "a self-proclaimed Boogaloo Bois" member, indicted for possessing a firearm after previously being judicially committed to a mental institution. Rankin posted on his Facebook account photos of himself and others carrying firearms at a George Floyd protest in Texas. "I'm BOOGALOO we hate police," he said. "...[H]ope they burn the precinct down." (The other three FBI press releases involved groups that would play no role on January 6.)

The Boogaloo Bois are officially described as an anti-government, anti-authority, and anti-police movement focused on attacking enforcers of a tyrannical and compromised political order. A May 2020 classified intelligence report ("COVID-19 Protest Disinformation Campaigns") said: "Many groups have described the pandemic as the beginning of "boogaloo," a term used by far-right extremists to mean a new American civil war."

Bugaloo Bois emerged in 2019 and amassed quite a track record of violence in the year before the election, drawing the attention of the FBI. Such an organized group fit with the FBI model, accustomed as it was to going after crime syndicates whether in its battle with organized crime or al Qaeda. The approach was the same: map the leadership structure, build an informer network, attack the key nodes. But a more important insight, according to former FBI agents and officials, is the fact that the Boogaloo Bois also emerged as a direct threat to law enforcement.

Earlier in 2020, a Boogaloo Bois member killed a federal protective security officer in Oakland, California. In May, another fired bullets into a police station amid protests over the killing of George Floyd. And then, just a month before the election, 13 men linked to the Boogaloo-affiliated Wolverine Watchmen militia were arrested for planning to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

A month after the election, another member of the Boogaloo Bois pled guilty to conspiracy to provide material support, "namely property, services and weapons" to Hamas, the Palestinian group that is designated foreign terrorists by the United States.

It was a sophisticated sting of the "Boojahideen," as the FBI called it, not unlike al Qaeda and ISIS-related arrests, in which an FBI informant played the role of a Hamas operative to ensnare the target.

"This case highlights the real threat posed by domestic violent extremists who self-radicalize and threaten to violently attack others opposed to their views, with little or no warning," the FBI division head said.

Around the same time, the Department of Homeland Security put out a classified intelligence report about the George Floyd counter-protests stating that "violent opportunists will continue to exploit ongoing nationwide lawful protests as a pretext to attempt to disrupt law enforcement operations; target law enforcement personnel, assets, and facilities; and damage public and private property."

Why did the Bureau drop the ball? Contrary to speculation, Trump did not stop the agencies from reporting. And Newsweek's examination of 87,000 homeland security-related reports from 2020 reveals a marked tendency to focus on international terrorism and/or the presence of a threat to law enforcement. So what about the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, the main organized groups that would mount the attack on the Capitol? The FBI wasn't that interested. Another massive fail of the domestic intelligence community was brewing, none of it Donald Trump's doing.


# 'Just Put Me In Charge,' Rudy Giuliani Told Donald Trump. 'They Stole This Thing' [4]
As the numbers moved towards Joe Biden on November 6, Donald Trump went on a Twitter rampage. His tweets, and those of this closest advisors, fed the belief that the election had been stolen and that Trump was truly the winner.


> 07:20:19	So now the Democrats are working to gain control of the U.S. Senate through their actions on John James, David Perdue, and more. Would End the Filibuster, Life, 2A, and would Pack and Rotate the Court. Presidency becomes even more important. We will win! November 6, 2020 


> 07:22:47	I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide! November 6, 2020 

> This is what we know. We have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance. The Governor, Wolf, and the State Supreme Court, flagrantly violated the Constitution of the U.S. The power to set these rules and regulations is vested in the ....Legislature. They just ignored that, ignored the Constitution. Now we bring it down to the counting houses, and outrageously, observers, who are the sentinels of integrity & transparency, were excluded. Pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way, and........has been able to render decisions in a matter of days. Ken Starr, former Independent Counsel @Varneyco ....hopefully this will be corrected at the Supreme Court of the United States. Also, these late ballots past Election Day are illegal, exactly what the President has been saying. The Supreme Court, in extraordinary circumstances,...

> With the attack by the Radical Left Dems on the Republican Senate, the Presidency becomes even more important!

> Where are the missing military ballots in Georgia? What happened to them?
> Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!

> I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!

During the day, Trump met with campaign officials and lawyers whom he had charged with looking into election results. Trump brought in Rudy Giuliani on a call. "They stole this thing," the former NYC mayor told Trump. "If you just put me in charge" we could fix it, Giuliani said. Sidney Powell, a lawyer for the campaign and the former attorney for Michael Flynn, claimed on Fox Business a "likelihood that 3 percent of the total vote was changed in the pre-election, voting ballots there were collected digitally." At 9:00 a.m., Trump tweeted: "STOP THE COUNT!" following up an hour later with "ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED."

Donald Trump Jr. urged "total war" over the election results, tweeting: "The best thing for America's future is for Donald Trump to go to total war over this election to expose all of the fraud, cheating, dead/no longer in state voters, that has been going on for far too long." Via Twitter, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) called on Arizona Governor Doug Ducey to "investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Dominion ballot software and its impact on our general election." That tweet helped spark a social media wildfire, drawing intense interest from accounts that regularly circulated QAnon-related content.

In Detroit, Michigan, more than 200 protesters, including militia movement members, gather to demonstrate. In Youngtown, Ohio, Trump supporters targeted a local news station for a protest. More protests took place in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Kelly O'Brien posted, "DO NOT GIVE UP THE GOOD FIGHT! Elections will not be stolen in this country. Not My Country. What it took to accomplish THE MIRACLE known as THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is amazing. Fight for this. Fight for your freedom. Fight for future generations. It's up to you. DO NOT GIVE UP! We will win this. Truth always prevails." The Pennsylvania woman would later go on to lead protests on January 6 and was arrested for entering the Capitol.

The COVID-19 pandemic made no concession to the political turmoil, and Washington D.C. was a district caught in the middle. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued Mayor's Order 2020-110, which modified the requirements for visitors coming into Washington DC and District residents returning to DC from any state or country that was not considered "low-risk." The new requirements required visitors and residents to use testing, in conjunction with other strategies for stopping the spread of COVID-19, to understand their potential exposure.

Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who had frequently appeared at public events without a mask, had been diagnosed with COVID-19, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on November 6. It was not immediately clear when or how he had been infected.


# The 'Adults' Vanished, Leaving Four Seasons Total Landscaping for Rudy Giuliani [5]
Claiming "this was a stolen election," Trump again took to Twitter to rant.

> Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states. As a separate matter, hundreds of thousands of Votes were illegally not allowed to be OBSERVED.... This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States, including Pennsylvania, which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night, only to see a massive lead disappear, without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE, for long intervals of time, what the happened...Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed. Tractors blocked doors & windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms. BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE! ....This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States, including Pennsylvania, which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night, only to see a massive lead disappear, without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE, for long intervals of time, what the happened...Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed. Tractors blocked doors & windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms. BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE! People were screaming STOP THE COUNT & WE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY (As Legal Observers were refused admittance to count rooms)!

> Four Season's Landscaping! https://t.co/kZ6xTFOx6M 

> I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!
> THE OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES. BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHICH OUR OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WERE SENT TO PEOPLE WHO NEVER ASKED FOR THEM! 71,000,000 Legal Votes. The most EVER for a sitting President!

Son-in-law Jared Kushner, one of the few "adults" in the White House who had the president's ear, tried to talk him into conceding the election, CNN reported. But as Trump descended into fury and self-delusion, another pattern emerged. People inside the White House started to disappear, either because they were shunned by the president or they wanted to divorce themselves from Trump's increasingly incoherent challenge.Even Kushner vanished, off to the Middle East to continue work on the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and select Arab states, of which Saudi Arabia and the rich Gulf States were the ultimate prize. And Kushner's wife, presidential daughter Ivanka Trump, disappeared as well, spending time in Florida to make arrangements for post-White House life, finding a house and a school for the kids.
Trumpworld was in chaos, increasingly split between the regulars and the external yes men and women whom Trump increasingly relied on. Rudy Giuliani and several other hangers-on held a news conference in Philadelphia, in the outskirts of the city in an industrial part of town in the parking lot in front of a business called Four Seasons Total Landscaping.

The former mayor of New York, once a 9/11 hero, rambled at length, saying the president not going to concede, throwing out one conspiracy claim after another, including a claim that Pennsylvania ballots had been tampered with.

Donald Trump, who'd tweeted that his lawyers would appear at the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, wasn't happy with Giuliani's performance. He was particularly upset with the low-rent venue. It was the news media's reaction to the Giuliani show, once Trump got back to watching television from his normal weekend at the golf course, that galvanized him. Cable TV and the Internet were on fire with every form of mockery of Rudy and the Trump camp. Biden won, and as more votes came in, that lead would surely grow.

The MAGA spectacle, now transformed into a raucous tantrum, amused the mainstream media and Biden supporters. They believed that those in the streets didn't represent a constituency: they were idiots being instigated by a brilliant Donald Trump and riled up by an alternative media world that existed on a channel that Biden backers didn't watch. And most important, the view took hold that the protestors were white supremacists and armed militia, fascists and extremists. The names—Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, QAnon, Boogaloo Bois— started to become household talking points while the tens of millions of other Trump voters were invisible.

Stop the Steal protests took place across the United States at state capitols and ballot-counting locations in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia. At the Pennsylvania state capitol, extremists including armed militias, white supremacists, QAnon believers, and Proud Boys participated in a heavily armed protest.Extremists, including white nationalist movement leaders and Proud Boys, also begin promoting and planning a "Million MAGA March" in Washington D.C. for Nov. 14.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser traveled Saturday to Delaware, a state with significantly higher coronavirus risk than the District, to celebrate President-elect Joe Biden's victory, drawing immediate criticism from conservative media. Fox News' headline: "DC mayor disregarded own COVID restrictions to attend Biden victory speech, defends 'essential travel.' ""STOP WATCHING CORPORATE MEDIA OUTLETS. AND YES, THIS INCLUDES FOX NEWS," posted Kelly O'Brien, an Allentown, Pennsylvania, activist who would later be charged with entering a restricted building, disorderly and disruptive conduct, and engaging in physical violence on January 6.

"The media doesn't decide who our President is. We do. ... YOUR PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING FOR YOU! KEEP FIGHTING FOR HIM!," she said."WE NEED PATRIOTS! WE NEED FREEDOM FIGHTERS! Now!"At the Pentagon, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley attended his first security briefing about the November 14 "Million MAGA March.""This could be the modern American equivalent of 'brownshirts in the streets,'" he feared.
 
# As Tensions Rose, U.S. Intelligence Spotted Election Meddling by China, Russia, Iran [6]
"Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be?" Donald Trump tweeted on November 8. The campaign issued a statement that it planned to pursue legal challenges to election results in certain states. In early November, another issue, COVID-19, dominated the news in America. The number of daily cases in the United States exceeded 100,000, a record, on election day. And on November 8, global confirmed COVID cases surpassed 50 million, with twenty percent of them in the United States. Trump, his wife Melania and son Barron had already come down with COVID, and in the week of the election, White House staffers started to be infected with the virus. First was Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who tested positive days after the election. The former North Carolina lawmaker was President Trump's top advisor who regularly accompanied him on the campaign and other trips

Then the man who was leading the Trump campaign's legal challenges to the election, David Bossie, tested positive, removing him from the decision-making circle as he too was banned from the White House and campaign headquarters. Most important, Meadows and Bossie lost face-to-face contact with the president, the most effective way to keep his attention.Into the vacuum stepped Rudy Giuliani, who together with Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor from Texas, became the proselytizers of election fraud. Powell was the inventor of the claim that Dominion Voting Systems machines changed votes, an unsubstantiated assertion that later brought on a defamation suit by the company, as well as a federal judge ruling that Powell and other pro-Trump lawyers had to pay attorney's fees for the State of Michigan and the city of Detroit, which had incurred extraordinary expenses in their defense.

Giuliani was a "fucking idiot," Attorney General William Barr said later, according to Bob Woodward's and Robert Costa's book "Peril." He was desperate for money (and attention) and drinking too much, Barr said. Others thought the Rudy-and-Powell duo was a "clown show," with Powell claiming that Trump didn't lose the election because of "massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the interference in our elections."

Nearly everyone in the White House and the anti-Trump camp guffawed. But behind the scenes, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was reporting over 1,000 fake China-connected Twitter accounts agitating around the election. There was evidence as well, the intelligence agencies said in classified reports, of Iranian agitation influencing domestic politics. In March, Acting Homeland Secretary Chad Wolf had decried rumors spreading of a "national shutdown," saying the reports were part of a disinformation campaign, stemming possibly from Russia or other malicious cyber actors. "New reports indicate that China has shifted to use 'Russian-Style' disinformation tactics amid the COVID-19 outbreak," a March 31 report said.

In April, a homeland security classified report said that Russian intelligence services were using COVID to probe the United States. "Russia's examination of the American public's reaction to disinformation could help improve future campaigns unleashed during a crisis or degraded relations, shaking public confidence in the US government," the report said. "In preparation for a wartime attack," the report continued, Russia's Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets (SODCIT) "seeks to sap the will to fight from its adversary by, among other things, putting pressure on the population ..." In April as well, DHS reported that Russia was conducting "malign influence operations" against the 2020 Census. During the George Floyd demonstrations in June, DHS reported that Russia, China and Iran were using the U.S. protests for their own propaganda, "selectively amplifying content surrounding riots and portraying the country as divided, hypocritical, and racist." The intelligence communities' Election Threat Update in August highlighted cyber-attacks from China, Russia, and Iran. FBI Director Christopher Wray said a variety of foreign adversaries were looking to "amplify controversy in this country" using state and social media to convey disinformation and fake information.

The reports were a hodgepodge, but there was enough evidence of foreign influence and extremist intent to sound alarm bells. As early as January 2020, homeland security was reporting that "violent" extremist groups were using their own social media to foment others to target law enforcement officials and politicians. In February, a classified homeland security report said that "white racially motivated violent extremists" were suggesting "bioterrorism" to spread coronavirus. "When discussing the virus they have used terms such as corona-chan, bowlronavirus (referencing Dylann Roof) and boogaflu (modification of the term boogaloo which is used to reference a future civil war)."

DHS "Open Source Collections Operations" were monitoring Telegram and other right-wing favored social media, even encrypted messaging channels, issuing daily reports of threats to state and local officials and to "critical infrastructure in response to COVID quarantines." As early as March 19, the social media spying noted a "racially motivated violent extremist" organization posting a message "encouraging the dissemination of disinformation promoting 'doomsday' behavior and social unrest amid the coronavirus outbreak."

"Social media users are sharing and discussing perceived threats associated with the US Government response to the [COVID] outbreak," another report said, "specifically tied to social media rumors and fears of martial law and gun confiscation. Some domestic terrorism-related activity in the United States historically has been driven by similar conspiracy theories, increasing our concern that a violent extremist could seek to conduct an attack based on this misinformation." "Anti-government groups, specifically the Oath Keepers," yet another report said, "have long promoted the conspiracy that the U.S. government will use a major event, like a pandemic or terror attack, to impose martial law, confiscate guns, ban interstate travel, and engage in mass detention of citizens."

# The Silent Coup Against Donald Trump Emerged in a Super-Secure Meeting Room [7]
In the days following the election, the chiefs of all of the top national security agencies were on edge. Secretary of Defense Mike Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley, CIA Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher Wray: all believed they might be fired because they were not loyal enough to the president. Trump administration insiders, even former White House Chief of Staff retired General John Kelly, told them they were "dead meat."

The ability to hire and fire at will was largely the only unilateral power remaining to Donald Trump. At 12:54 p.m. on Monday, November 9, he tweeted that he was pleased to announce that Christopher C. Miller, "the highly respected" director of the National Counterterrorism Center, would become acting Secretary of Defense, "effective immediately." "Mark Esper has been terminated," Trump tweeted. "I would like to thank him for his service."

Esper had opposed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, had actively pushed back on the president's money-focused desire to withdraw from NATO and blow up the U.S.-South Korea alliance. And had disagreed with the president about putting troops of the streets of America to suppress George Floyd-related demonstrations.
Trump had grown to hate Esper, but it was still startling for a lame duck president to fire the most consequential member of the cabinet—the civilian leader of the military, the person in the chain of command for everything including launching nuclear weapons.

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had called Esper earlier to tell him that the president was not happy with his performance, that he had not been sufficiently supportive, that Trump was going to announce the firing that very day. It was just a head's up.You'll be replaced by Chris Miller, Meadows said. Esper thought to himself "Who?" according to an account in "I Alone Can Fix It" by Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker.

At the same time as the president's tweet went out, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien called the Pentagon to inform Gen. Milley that Miller and his principal assistant Kash Patel would be at the building very soon. And at 2:15 p.m., Miller arrived.

The new acting secretary was a former special operations officer and had retired from the Army in 2014, going on to work for a defense contractor before joining the White House two years earlier. He wasn't close to the president, but he was considered a member of his loyal group: one of the most loyal and therefore most dangerous in the eyes of D.C. national security experts. Patel was a former aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and he had worked with the Congressman during his famous leak—obtained from White House staffers—that the government had collected intelligence on the Trump transition team and that their names had been "unmasked" and widely shared inside the Obama administration.

Though the intelligence was collected incidental to a Russia counterintelligence probe, Trump had a field day, claiming he was wiretapped by President Obama. The leak was followed by a Nunes memo alleging an FBI conspiracy against the new president. Patel was author of that memo, rising from a congressional aide to principal deputy to the Director of National Intelligence—a political appointment—before moving to the White House where, according to all accounts, he was a back-channel and spy for Donald Trump, circumventing the normal chain of command just as the president liked to do, and involving himself in matters beyond his formal portfolio.

And then announcements came out that two other Trump loyalists—retired Army General Anthony Tata, a Fox News pundit, and Ezra Cohen-Watnick, former assistant to Trump's first national security advisor, retired Gen. Michael Flynn—also were being appointed to top Pentagon posts. At 2:30 in the afternoon, Milley met with the other military chiefs for an hour in the Tank, the super-secure room where personal matters and opinions can be openly discussed. All afternoon, his phone rang constantly—members of Congress, field commanders, retired military generals and admirals, personal friends, fellow officers and national security officials in other countries—all worried about what Esper's firing portended, curious about what Trump might be planning. In the evening, Milley met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, confiding that he thought, according to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's "Peril," that Trump was in "mental decline." Pompeo agreed.

A coup was gathering steam—but not necessarily in anything President Trump would or could actually do, nor on the part of the new Trump appointees. The coup was more on the part of Gen. Milley and other officials, the apolitical keepers of national security. They began taking action (for the good of the republic, as they saw it), doggedly continuing to run their departments, making decisions about the domestic situation and indeed the world, while the White House was paralyzed by its election fixation. Some talked about the 25th Amendment, where the majority of the Cabinet could declare the president unfit and remove him. Some pondered the safeguards they could put in place if worse came to worse. Senior officers talked among themselves about their responsibility to the Constitution and their oaths.

In their minds, they had to be ready to protect the country; as Trump became more obsessed with the election, he abandoned any pretense of governing. The word "coup" may evoke some sunglasses-wearing general standing at a podium announcing that the military has deposed the civilian leadership for the good of the country. But circumventing and even ignoring the commander-in-chief and the chief executive, as the nation's most powerful security officials did, was a coup nonetheless.

# The Oath Keepers Called for Attacks on the Government: Insurrection, by Definition [8]

In an Internet broadcast on November 10, Oath Keepers founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, a graduate of Yale Law School, talked about the upcoming rally planned for Washington over the weekend. He said his organization had armed men on standby by "as a nuclear option" to prevent the election from being stolen from Donald Trump.
"This election was stolen and this is a communist/Deep State coup, every bit as corrupt and illegitimate as what is done in third world banana republics," he said. The only way to prevent his men from engaging in a "bloody fight," he said, would be for Donald Trump to declassify the information already in the government's hands that would expose the ring of pedophiles in the "deep state" who were trying to prevent the president from staying in power.Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 after the election of Barack Obama. In 2010, homeland security intelligence merely described The Oath Keepers is "a nonprofit organization with a constitutionalist ideology" that "promotes themselves as patriots and is comprised mainly of military and law enforcement personnel."

"The Oath Keepers maintain several websites upon which they list 10 orders they believe are unconstitutional and therefore have the right to refuse to follow," said one of the first internal reports about the group. The next year, a homeland security-funded fusion center warned in a restricted report that many organizations like the "anti-government" Oath Keepers were attempting to recruit public safety personnel into their organizations to create greater legitimacy "and gain access to government information and contacts." Postings on YouTube, the report said, talked about a "New World Order" and a "rising up" against a "tyrannical government." "The Republic is on the verge of destruction precisely because Republicans have chosen the lesser of two evils (the lesser of two oath breakers) in each election," Rhodes said in 2012. "When you take a slightly reduced dose of poison, say 80% poison instead of 100%, you are still poisoning yourself, and you will still die."

At the end of the Obama administration, another homeland security report said the Oath Keepers and another organization—the Three Percenters—were the two largest national groups within the militia movement, justifying violence to counter "perceived threats or violations to the US Constitution," particularly to prevent the seizure of personal weapons on behalf of one-world government, the foreign troops on American soil forcing those who resist into secret FEMA-built concentration camps. Other intelligence reports said that though Rhodes portrayed immigrants from Central and South America as waging a war on the "the West to flood us with Third World people," the organization overall was not racist, having many African-American members.

During the 2016 campaign and throughout the Trump administration, armed Oath Keepers would show up to provide voluntary "security," sometimes illegal because of the presence of arms, sometimes even at polling places, sometimes after natural disasters such as hurricanes. With Trump in office, the Oath Keepers pivoted to supporting the president's "America First" agenda, increasingly suspicious of the "deep state" conspiracy that was, in their view, actively thwarting Trump's objectives. That became their rallying cry during most of the next four years.

By 2020, propelled partially by COVID, the Oath Keepers descended deeper into the world of conspiracies, promoting anti-lockdown and then anti-vaccine rhetoric. Rhodes started speaking of taking up arms in what he predicted would be a "bloody civil war" against the U.S. government. The organization continued to encourage law enforcement and military personnel to actively resist orders they considered unconstitutional. And they saw law enforcement officers who enforced what they called an illegitimate version of the Constitution to be enemies of freedom, a rarity (though growing) in right-wing ranks. An early 2020 intelligence report says, "The Oath Keepers' current recruiting pitch focuses on gun rights and the Second Amendment. But unlike other gun libertarians, the Oath Keepers promote paranoid fears of a 'New World Order' conspiracy and spread veiled anti-Semitism in distrusting 'elites.'" Another homeland security classified report in March 2020 called the Oath Keepers "one of the largest anti-government groups active in the United States," boasting a membership in the tens of thousands.

"The Oath Keepers conspiratorial ideology," the report said, "promotes the idea that the government will use a major event—like a pandemic, natural disaster, or terror attack—to impose martial law in the U.S. and confiscate guns, ban interstate travel, and engage in the unlawful mass detention of U.S. citizens."

Though the Oath Keepers would become one of the most widely-known, name-brand groups, there is no evidence that the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security shifted any resources to examining their violent and anti-government threats. The domestic security apparatus should not have ignored such talk: in speaking openly about attacking the federal government, the Oath Keepers were, by definition, insurrectionists.

# 'We Are On the Way to a Right-wing Coup,' the CIA Director Privately Warned [9]
It was the president's first public appearance since the election—apart from his golf outings. On Veterans Day, November 11, Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Ceremony. It was a somber occasion amid a steady rain, shadowed by the president's refusal to concede the election and by his firing of Secretary of Defense Mark Esper so close to a transition.Trump and Pence, accompanied by their wives, were late; their motorcade arrived well after the ceremony had started. The Army honor guard had already gone through most of their drill and the 21-gun salute rang out as the country's elected leaders were driving up.

At the appointed moment, Trump walked to the wreath and laid a hand on it before returning to his spot to stand for the rest of the ceremony, about a half-hour. He made no public remarks, according to the White House pool reporters there. Unlike most years, this Veterans Day ceremony was not open to the public because of COVID. The cemetery website stated that masks were required for all visitors, but neither Trump nor anyone in his inner circle wore one.

Trump was already at war with Arlington cemetery. When he heard that the annual holiday wreath event, where thousands of volunteers lay holiday wreaths on every headstone in the cemetery, was not scheduled to take place that year, he had tweeted that he "reversed the ridiculous decision to cancel Wreaths Across America."Despite the rules, and despite COVID, after Trump's tweet the Army reversed its decision to cancel the event and announced that it had found a "safe" plan. In fact, the Army had consulted public health officials who advised against holding the event, even though it was outside.Among the large Pentagon entourage in attendance at the cemetery were Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

On election night, Milley had received a private call, according to the book "I Alone Can Fix It," in which a uniformed colleague—a fellow four-star and close friend—reminded the top general that he and the military had an apolitical role in the post-election fracas."Your loyalty is to the Constitution," the caller said. "You represent the stability of this republic." Former Secretary Esper also told Milley that he hoped the outcome of the election would be crystal clear from the margin of victory, fearing that anything less might provide President Trump an excuse to refuse to leave the White House, or more important, to call out the military.

Since Esper's firing, General Milley had heard rumors that one of Trump's loyalists planted at the Pentagon told a colleague that they had to "take Milley out." Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy also thought Milley would be fired, as did the general's wife.Milley was taken aback by the prospect of such an unprecedented action, afraid that he was witnessing the unfolding of a coup. CIA Director Gina Haspel, who also expected to be fired, shared his fear. "We are on the way to a right-wing coup," she told Milley.

In the "tank," the military-only chamber famous for deliberations and private discussion, the seven joint chiefs, plus Milley and the vice chairman, quietly and privately began talking about what their options would be if they had to block an unlawful order from the commander-in-chief. According to a retired general officer who spoke to one of the participants, in the tank the discussions were frank and emotional. "They grappled with wide-ranging questions," the senior officer said. "Not just how to protect the republic should Trump threaten, but also ways to protect the military institution, a goal that didn't always easily mesh with what needed to get done."

After the ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, acting secretary Miller and Gen. Milley went on to a celebration at the new National Museum of the United States Army. Speaking of the history of the armed forces and the role that the military played in American society, nonpartisan and now "professional," Milley drew his line in the sand.

"We are unique among militaries," he said in his speech. "We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a tyrant or a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. No, we do not take an oath to a country, a tribe or religion. We take an oath to the Constitution. And every soldier that is represented in this museum, every sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman, each of us will protect and defend that document, regardless of personal price."When Chris Miller got up to speak after Milley, he thanked the general for "setting the bar very high.""I think all I would say to your statements is, 'Amen, well done,'" he said.Meanwhile on television, retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey also voiced what many in the brass were thinking, warning that Americans were "watching a slow-moving Trump coup to defy the Biden election and refuse to leave office by diktat."

What was unfolding, though, was unique among coups. Nobody really thought the disorganized and isolated Trump was capable of organizing anything. And the president didn't have the support of the military or the CIA or the FBI, or any of the other national security agencies, perhaps, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security, which had become embarrassingly partisan. Milley even remarked privately that a coup wasn't possible because his camp had all the guns—a comment that was both comforting and chilling, one that showed how perilous the post-election period had become.

Ultimately, the uniformed military and other permanent national security professionals did take it upon themselves to decide how to defend the nation from this prospective coup, disregarding the new secretary and the other Trump cronies filling leadership positions in the Pentagon. Miller was ignored except in cases where the Secretary of Defense's approval or signature was required. Flouting the hallowed tradition of civilian control of the military that is at the core of the Constitution, and ignoring the commander-in-chief, Milley set the uniformed military as a bulwark against disaster.

As self-appointed protectors of the nation, the military took on powers that are not in the Constitution. The armed forces are barely mentioned in the document and no powers are given to them to protect the sanctity of any vote. And until the inauguration on January 20, Donald Trump was the president and commander in chief: Trump's cabinet, the Congress and the Supreme Court were the appropriate place to look if presidential powers or behavior demanded action.

President Trump could at least in theory have launched a nuclear first strike on China. Because of his evident impulsiveness, proposals had been introduced in Congress to reduce his powers, to change the reliance on a single decision-maker. But post-election, the situation became more alarming. The only other person in the civilian chain of command who on paper could thwart a presidential order was the new secretary of defense, essentially unknown.

Gen. Milley wasn't formally in that chain of command, merely the "principal military advisor" to the president and a commander of nothing. Still, he had enormous influence over the entire military and could urge others to refuse an order. Military officers at the White House who would have to physically transmit a presidential order could disagree. Once transmitted, an order from the White House could also be opposed by the four-star commander of the U.S. Strategic Command—and then, even if made it past the Omaha-based command, every missile launch crew, submarine commander and bomber pilot ordered to launch a bolt-out-of-the blue would have to search their hearts and reflect on their oaths.

This set of officers, nevertheless, weren't the only chain. Over decades of worry about a Soviet first strike, the government's nuclear priesthood had designated alternate presidents—for the Pentagon, for Strategic Command, secreted away in bunkers and aboard airborne command posts across America—who under certain conditions could take over (especially if communications were lost) to circumvent the official procedures and institute their own. This safety net was deeply classified, but it certainly scrambled what might happen. And there were other secret and little known alternative apparatuses—continuity of government systems fiercely guarding the survival of the president, Presidential Emergency Action Documents, secret military and federal law enforcement units—that were autonomous enough and certainly presented many question marks.In the end though, many in the military and national security establishment believed—as did much of the public—that Donald Trump's last line of defense was that he firmly controlled his fanatical base. By this reasoning, containing him would neutralize the mob: thus the necessity for the silent coup.Just eight weeks later it was clear that while Trump could fuel the fire, he could not douse it.

# 'Trump' Was Named in 1,200 Homeland Security Threat Reports Before the Election [10]

"Dominion Deleted 2.7 Million Trump Votes Nationwide," Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday, November 12. Citing a news story he saw on the right-wing One America News Network, Trump said that 1.2 million Trump votes in Pennsylvania had either been deleted or switched by Dominion Voting Systems machines. States using Dominion machines, Trump said, had overall switched 435,000 Trump votes to Joe Biden.Many people found the claims laughable, but at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Christopher Krebs, the head of the department's cyber security agency, was affronted. The idea that voting machines themselves were compromised was first raised by Rudy Giuliani's sidekick Sidney Powell. Trump picked it up and he now again repeated the claim. But Krebs' agency was responsible for protecting the election systems from external attack, and they had particularly worked on the integrity and safety of voting machines.

Krebs decided he "couldn't let it stand." He organized a response and his Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), together with the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee, a combination of state-level and civil organizations, issued a statement: "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history," they said. "Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result." The statement said that it was common to review any closely contested election. "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised," the statement concluded, directly contradicting the president.

All during the election cycle, behind the scenes, Kreb's agency had been working with the FBI and the intelligence community, monitoring potential threatening cyber activity and working with state and local authorities to offer technical assistance. And still, the narrative had been created from the muddled story of Russian hacking in 2016 that votes could be altered. It was, in fact, partly to thwart interference in future elections that the systems associated with voter rolls, voting, and counting the vote had been declared "critical infrastructure" in the last year of the Obama administration. And from that, Krebs' agency was born.

Critical infrastructure or not, with the election system now something to be protected, voting turned into a quasi-national security matter—and a point of contention. It seemed like the beginning of some federal mandate for standardization amongst thousands of separate state systems: which might itself, by eliminating the diversity of rules and methods of voting and counting, make voting systems more vulnerable. And others, including many state Attorneys General, believed it was federal encroachment into a state-level function as specified in the Constitution.

DHS, created in the wake of 9/11, has always been an odd man out, an amalgam of disparate agencies: a larger federal law enforcement agency than the FBI, a uniformed military with its own reconnaissance planes and drones but no responsibility for the national defense (other than in the Coast Guard), an organization created to be the counter-terrorism hub when it was neither the National Counterterrorism Center nor the FBI. Homeland security wandered far from its original intent since 2003, a not-quite civil agency and not-quite national security, a finger in everything from flood maps in America to civilian cyber security, but not really in charge anywhere. They were bureaucratic interlopers.

To make matters even more complicated for DHS, terrorism itself had also been redefined in the span of two decades, from the people who attacked America to everyone and anyone threatening the United States and its allies. Domestically, from a narrowly defined group of revolutionaries, hijackers and bombers, terrorism expanded to encompass Unabomber-like deranged individuals and "lone wolves" attracted to whatever cause (including racist and anti-Semitic ones). And then with a definitional softening—the term terrorist shifted to "violent extremist" in Washington lingo—the number of possible terrorists expanded into a gigantic potential threat base, the word extremist applying to potentially destructive and violent individuals on the left (ecoterrorists, Antifa activists, hackers) as well as those on the right. But it was not just those who were driven to violence. Many activists and protestors, now labeled extremists, became potential enemies of the state.

Still, beyond al Qaeda, ISIS and their ilk, the department hardly ever found itself out in front of whatever was the public mania of the moment. Whether actually securing the border or figuring out the domestic security mission, DHS was always almost there, in search of a unique mission. The department and its agencies—ICE, TSA, border patrol—came to be hated, seen as the control freak of air travel, the abuser of migrants and asylum seekers, a federal enforcer and private-sector bully in a country that otherwise eschewed a domestic intelligence agency and reserved the majority of powers to the states.

"The mission of the Department kept expanding," says a homeland security executive. "But I'm not sure I could say that homeland security ever fully mastered any of the responsibilities it was given." The official requested anonymity because he feared retaliation.

Perhaps that too—the ambiguity of what homeland security actually was, plus what they should do that was unique—is what made them so susceptible to being a changeling in different administrations. Under Trump, DHS became a partisan government outlier, largely an outsider to the national security community. Over four years of the Trump administration, the traditional national security agencies—the military, FBI and CIA—fiercely protected their turf and created a force field to repel homeland security overreach and presidential whim. DHS was happy to take on Trump's border wall and feed the growing anti-immigrant constituency in America. This also explained the department's interference of local law enforcement during the protests of 2020 after the death of George Floyd.

Homeland security targeted extremist threats on the right and left. Contrary to popular opinion, of 1.1 million threat reports stored on the "for official use only" Homeland Security Information Network for the years preceding the 2020 election, the ratio of right-wing to left-wing reports is almost five-to-one. Ten times more reports cover hate crimes and white supremacists than any left wing causes. Of course the number of reports should reflect the prevalence of threats and incidents—that is, that there was a greater threat of violence emerging from the right-wing. So the numbers do seem to suggest that the right was indeed the subject of more intelligence attention than the left. The largest single group subject to reporting was the anti-government Sovereign Citizens, resulting in six times more reports than Antifa.

Newsweek's exclusive review of the evidence also suggests, though, that homeland security didn't overly bother itself with pro-Trumpers. Mention of the word Trump appears in just 1,200 of the 1.1 million reports; "Make America Great Again," in any context, appears in just 30 reports. There is no evidence in the reports of much interest in the groups—Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters—that would be involved in the January 6 assault, and contrary to conventional wisdom, the reporting between election day and the attack on the Capitol regarding any threats to Washington was sparse compared to every other threat from Russian meddling to COVID fraud.What the numbers suggest is that the entire apparatus of domestic security, from DHS to the state-level fusion centers, failed to understand what was going on in the country—the threat to the nation—despite abundant dots existing out in the open. That was in contrast with 9/11, where the dots lurked within the intelligence community.

And then there's homeland security's many missions. Perhaps in a desire to avoid politics, the bureaucrats targeted transnational organized crime, child porn and human traffickers. There are 10 times as many reports related to child exploitation than any kind of domestic terror, five times as many dealing with critical infrastructure—everything from the electrical power grid to amusement parks. And most of the reports about individual groups focus on groups like Sovereign Citizens which are considered threats to law enforcement itself, a major preoccupation of the domestic intelligence apparatus.

Insufficient resources and attention were allocated to the growing domestic threat, but the answer was never more resources or people for DHS. The real issue: what was the department's mission and why did America even have a domestic enforcer when it had an FBI, an ATF, a DEA and U.S. Marshals, all of whom had primary responsibility for everything people imagined that homeland security was there to do.

# Donald Trump Supporters Didn't Appreciate Barack Obama's 'So-Called Wisdom'[11]

If President Trump had been running the country, he stopped after Friday, November 13, focusing almost all of his attention on election results and his Stop the Steal claims. Republicans also began lining up behind the president, and not just the right wing of the party.The day began with the latest in what would become an avalanche of court defeats for Donald Trump and the Trump campaign. In Arizona, the Trump campaign withdrew its overvotes challenge, dropping its formal claim that voting machines counted Joe Biden votes more than once. In Michigan, a judge threw out a petition to restrict certification of the votes in the state. In Pennsylvania, two judges rejected the Trump campaign's attempts to stop counting the votes, though the court ruled that the Harrisburg-based Secretary of State lacked the authority to change the voting deadline just two days before election day.

But, according to Michael Wolff's "Landslide," Trump's four primary campaign advisors (White House counsel Pat Cipollone; former impeachment lawyer Eric Hershmann; former counsel to Vice President Pence and general counsel of the Trump reelection campaign Matt Morgan; and Justin Clark, deputy national political director of the Trump 2016 campaign, head of the office of public liaison at the White House, and now a 2020 campaign advisor) all whipped Trump up, saying that there were "great constitutional offenses that had been committed against him."

Meanwhile, former president Barack Obama spoke up for the first time about the election controversies. He said that he was "more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, humoring him [Trump] in this fashion." CBS News released his remarks; his full interview on 60 Minutes would air on Sunday night. Obama said he felt the challenges were "delegitimizing" the incoming Biden administration but also "democracy generally." It's a "dangerous path," he said.His remarks drew harsh criticism. "Where was Obama when the Democratic Party refused to recognize that Trump had won the 2016 elections?" one social media commenter posted. "Too busy giving speeches to the same people he demonized during his time in office (Wall Street). Obama has shown that he is another professional politician who gets into politics to become a millionaire."

A second commenter wrote: "Once again we are showered with the so called wisdom of a president who thinks he is still important. ... He, as usual, like the democrats think because we think different we are not intelligent."A third said: "Obama is concerned about delegitimizing the Biden presidency when he and Biden both attempted along with the entire democratic establishment doing exactly that with Trump."

And yet another wrote: "Funny how a vast majority of the Democrats for the last four years refused to acknowledge Trump as the duly elected president, and have spent its entirety trying to get rid of him by any means necessary (legal or not) .... The Democrats with the help of Obama himself falsely accused the Trump campaign of conspiring with Russia to influence the 2016 election when it was Hillary and the DNC that actually conspired with Russians to influence the election. When that effort failed, they then began a farcical impeachment investigation along party lines, with nothing more than second and third-hand information and opinions, which failed to remove Trump from office."

Still another said: "It means Obama is desperately afraid of Trump's populist movement and it's push against globalism and socialism that Obama urgently wants our Country to turn to."There were inaccuracies in what some people said. But these were not, by and large, racist conspiracy-mongers. The Democratic Party machine and the mainstream did feast (and enriched themselves) on exaggerating the threat of, making fun of, and trying to get rid of Obama's unlikely successor. They stuck doggedly to the Trump collusion story long after it was proven baseless.These November 13 social media posters represented the core of the 74 million Americans who voted for the re-election of Donald Trump. And over and over they asked, What's wrong with making sure the votes are counted? What are they afraid of?

# 'There Will Be Bloodshed': As Night Fell, the Million MAGA March Turned Violent [12]

On Saturday, November 14, on a brilliantly sunny day, 11,000 Trump supporters descended on Washington for an amalgam of the Million MAGA March, March to Trump, and Stop the Steal. It was nowhere close to a million people, and that fact, together with what unfolded—a battle between protestors and counter-protestors—set the stage for almost everyone to focus on the wrong signs as January 6 neared.

At Freedom Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue, just east of the White House, a crowd of thousands showed their support for Donald Trump's election fraud claims, voicing their grievances about the direction of the country: an accumulation of disgruntlement with Washington, the feds, the CDC, politicians, the mainstream media, even with law enforcement. They marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Supreme Court, located just across the street from the Capitol building. "Fuck Antifa," the crowd chanted.

Speakers included the bombastic Alex Jones, host of Infowars and a vocal right-wing conspiracy guru, made even more seductive when he was banned by mainstream social media. Jones was accompanied by members of the Proud Boys, erstwhile bodyguards and extra security, a task that they had taken upon themselves, escorting the leadership of their world. One bodyguard wore a "Pinochet Did Nothing Wrong!" t-shirt, a reference to the leader of a military junta in Chile who toppled the democratically elected president and arrested over 100,000 enemies of the state, torturing a third of them.

At the rally, Jones spoke of a "second American Revolution" and led chants of "1776." It was his patented Deep State patter, conspiracies all around, a little bit of QAnon and a lot of Alex Jones. "We declare independence from that communist Chinese agent Joe Biden and his demonic pedophile family," he shouted. Former Trump administration official and right-wing social media influencer Sebastian Gorka whipped up the crowd and turned the focus back to Donald Trump, saying, "We can win because he did win."

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a QAnon conspiracy adherent just elected to Congress from Georgia, was also on hand to speak. Earlier in the day, she tweeted a diatribe about the repressive conditions in the nation's capital. "NOTHING is open," she said, not even her hotel gym, because of "Democrat tyrannical control." Later, she attacked those wearing COVID masks, calling them "oppressive." The Oath Keepers acted as security for several of the speakers.

To signal his acknowledgement and support, President Trump's presidential motorcade made a slight detour on the way to deliver him to a golf course in Virginia. They drove by the crowds on Pennsylvania Avenue. The previous day, Trump had tweeted: "Heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there, especially the organic Rallies that are springing up all over the Country, including a big one on Saturday in D.C. I may even try to stop by and say hello."

"The Million MAGA March was ... organized as a peaceful exercise of demonstrators' First Amendment rights with respect to the 2020 Presidential election," the FBI stated after the protest. "Members of the Proud Boys attended the demonstration wearing their yellow and black colors and other recognizable emblems and logos associated with the group."And though there were tensions between MAGA marchers and counter-protestors, the daytime rally was mostly peaceful. But as night fell the rally gave way to a number of violent clashes between MAGA agitators, counter demonstrators and police. "Activists spewed profanity and shouted threats, threw punches and launched bottles. On both sides, people were bloodied ... including four whose allegiances remain unknown on gun charges. The chaos also left two officers injured," reported the Washington Post. At least one person was stabbed and hospitalized.

Near midnight, a massive "TRUMP LAW AND ORDER" banner was laid atop Black Lives Matter Plaza, before it was moved close to the White House.The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) later reported 21 arrests for assault, assault on a police officer, possession of a weapon, disorderly conduct and inciting violence. There were also seven firearms recovered by MPD during this event, according to the Department of Homeland Security's internal "Million MAGA March After Action" report.

In its reporting of the protest and its aftermath, the mainstream news media mostly focused on the small size of the crowd and the big name individuals and groups like QAnon, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, portraying Trump supporters as conspiracy freaks and idiots. Counter-protestors, quoted as opposing racism and "fascism" and all things Trump, were given equal voice. The mainstream media also focused on the election count and the actual outcome of the election, ignoring the larger grievances of those who were there.

Law enforcement was occupied with clashes between contending groups. That had been the main focus of local and federal law enforcement in earlier protests. There were some important themes emerging, such as the condemnation of Fox News by Trump supporters. And there were armed protestors, violating District of Columbia law and signaling a propensity towards violence; the talk of revolution and a new Independence Day should have alerted the homeland security apparatus to see the groups as engaging in acts that could be considered insurrectionist and seditious.

Ron Schaffer, a member of the Oath Keepers from Indiana who attended the November 14 march, spoke to the news media that Saturday. "A group of thugs and criminals hijacked this country a long time ago. And now they're making their big move, and it's not gonna happen," he said. "They're messing with the wrong people here, trust me on that."We're not going to merge into some globalist, communist system, it will not happen," he said. "There will be a lot of bloodshed if it comes down to that, trust me ... If somebody wants to bring violence, I think there's a lot of us here that are ready for it ... they're pushing us to a point where we have no choice."Schaffer was later indicted for his role in the January 6 assault on the Capitol.

# 'Terrorists' at the Border? To Please Donald Trump, Homeland Security Tweaked Reports [13]

Continual role-changes and chaos at the Department of Homeland Security essentially destroyed the department's ability to secure the homeland. On November 15, for example, Chad Wolf was stripped of power. A federal judge in New York City ruled that Wolf was unlawfully serving as the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, violating the rules of succession and the Vacancies Reform Act. His orders, therefore, the judge said, particularly those relating to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, were "not an exercise of legal authority," nullifying the Trump administration's suspension of the program.
It was the latest court ruling against Donald Trump's attempt to undo the Obama-era program that shielded about 650,000 young immigrants who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children from being deported. Earlier in June, the Supreme Court dismissed the administration's attempt to cancel DACA, saying that Trump's reasoning was "arbitrary and capricious." President-elect Joe Biden had already announced that he planned to reinstate DACA and reverse other Trump administration immigration actions.

Wolf, a fierce Trump loyalist, had risen from chief of staff at TSA to deputy chief of staff, to being acting chief of staff before moving to the secretary's office and becoming Chief of Staff to Kirstjen Nielsen, all in the first year of Donald Trump's presidency. He then became acting Undersecretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans and then the Senior Official Performing the duties of the Undersecretary, the political commissar of the department. While working for the new secretary, he was point man on immigration and the border wall. Nielsen soon stumbled over her claims about how many terrorists had crossed the southern border, trying to justify the wall. She said that 3,755 "known and suspected terrorists" had been intercepted, and that an average of 10 individuals a day on the terrorist watch list were trying to enter the United States.

"I'd argue probably 98 percent of people that want to come here want hope, opportunity, liberty, freedom and all the things we may even take for granted ourselves," Fox News' Sean Hannity said in an interview of Nielsen. "But it's a 2 percent I worry about ... There are instances that you can confirm that you know of terrorists that have tried to cross our southern border and we've apprehended them.""Yes, Sean," Nielsen answered, "and we've talked about the thousands—the thousands of terror watchlist individuals who traveled through our hemisphere last year. To pretend there's not a danger on an unsecured border, on an open border, is just ridiculous. It belies common sense."

But the 3,755 number referred to all individuals of interest in fiscal year 2017, and not just those already on the watchlist. Most of them attempted to travel by air to the U.S., or had applied for visas and never traveled anywhere, and the vast majority didn't try to enter on the southern border. Moreover, the 3,755 number became muddled with more than 3,000 "special interest aliens"—individuals with suspicious travel patterns who may pose a national security risk—that the border patrol encountered at the border.

The Department and the White House dug in their heels to justify the border wall, even as new information indicated that a total of six people on the terrorist watchlist had actually been encountered at the southern border in FY2017. Three had crossed. As Brian Murphy, the DHS analyst who supplied the actual numbers, complained about the manipulation by the Trump-appointed leadership, Wolf and others discussed how they could fire him. He was soon excluded from meetings and later emerged as a whistleblower.

Nielsen resigned. The Senate-confirmed Undersecretary for National Protection was next in line to be the acting secretary, but the department installed the Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, as Acting Secretary. In June 2019, Wolf, as acting undersecretary, testified before Congress that "our Nation faces persistent threats and a dynamic threat environment. "As we look at attacks since 2014, what we see is four-fifths of those are domestic terrorism-related attacks here in the homeland. About one-fifth, or a little under one-fifth are what we call homegrown violent extremist (HVE) attacks, that deal more with a foreign ideology."Wolf said that identifying perpetrators of domestic terrorism "and racially motivated extremists," deciding how to intervene, and how homeland security could "counter the narratives" on social media, were the tasks as the department moved forward.

But Wolf and DHS kept busy changing offices. And the department's focus actually stayed on the Donald Trump-pleasing issues of immigrants and the border wall. Within months, McAleenan also departed. Wolf would be acting Secretary of Homeland Security. This was just days before the Senate actually confirmed Wolf to be Undersecretary, which allowed him to be sworn in. His appointment was illegal, as it occurred before Senate confirmation of Wolf as Undersecretary. Many experts and former government officials argued that appointing him in the first place from a non-Senate confirmed position was unconstitutional. And again, under the rules, he was not the senior-most official of the department, thereby making his appointment contrary to the law.

Wolf's claim to fame in 2020, before he disappeared from the public scene after the election, was picking a fight with New York State. He revoked New York residents' ability to participate in Global Entry and other Trusted Traveler programs in response to the state's "sanctuary" immigration policies. The case went to the courts where Trump administration lawyers admitted that DHS had made false statements to justify the exclusion. The department then removed the Global Entry restrictions. Congress badgered Wolf and the department to focus more on the issues that mattered. But it wasn't domestic terrorism they were pushing for: it was protecting the country against COVID. And even there, with COVID raging, Wolf focused on Russian disinformation, especially in dispelling rumors of a national shutdown, which he blamed on Moscow.

Though the department found itself on the outs with the growing anti-vaxxer movement, it roared back in mid-2020, intervening in the George Floyd and racial justice protests that sprung up across America. Whistleblower Murphy again complained about pressure to focus on Antifa and "anarchist" groups rather than white supremacist groups—including pressure on him to modify intelligence reports to harmonize them with what President Trump was saying. By November, homeland security was irrelevant.

# With a Tweet, Donald Trump Fired the Official Who Stated There Was No Election Fraud [14]

On Monday, November 16th, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray were worried enough about Donald Trump & Company's loud claims to meet with election security experts to more fully understand the systems and machines that had been used in the elections. "I won the Election!" President Trump tweeted in the morning. "The Radical Left Democrats, working with their partner, the Fake News Media, are trying to STEAL this Election," he tweeted. "We won't let them!" Then election conspiracy head Sidney Powell was quoted as saying that Trump's lawyers were "getting ready to overturn election results in multiple states."

FBI forensic experts and Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) officials piled into the Top Secret cleared special room at the Department of Justice to brief Barr and Wray and answer questions. According to a homeland security executive who was in the room, who requested anonymity because he is discussing classified matters, the discussion was intense and technical, the two men drilling into the details.

Was there any way that the Dominion Voting Systems machine could change votes? The answer was no. Was there any veracity to the claim that the microchips in the machines, made in China, could be programmed a certain way or manipulated in the machines? The answer was no. Was there any way that other systems used to count votes could or were penetrated? The answer was no. Was there any way mail-in ballots were thrown away, fraudulently submitted, falsely counted? The answer was no: nothing even close to what the Trump camp was claiming. There was discussion of the intelligence on Russian and Iranian attempts to interfere in the elections through social media as well as attempts traced back to them to penetrate state-level databases. But after 2016, holes had been plugged up and the two agencies—along with the CIA, the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command —were this time focused on thwarting any interference. Was there any way that the integrity of the elections were questionable? The answer was no. What about fraud on the part of vote counters and local officials? No sign, said the FBI.

The conclusion was definitive. All of the claims were false and concocted. There was no way votes had been stolen from anyone. Maybe there were mistakes in tabulating at the county or state-level. Yes, mail-in ballots were processed after November 3. But nothing—nothing—suggested any steal. "Yes, there's been election fraud in the past, but the controversies surrounding the outcomes of elections, in 2000 with Bush and the election of Donald Trump, were never about anyone changing votes. They were about mistakes. And mostly politics," the homeland security executive told Newsweek.

The head of the CISA Christopher Krebs, a former Microsoft policy director, had maintained a rumor control blog. He felt so strongly about the work of his agency that he stated publicly that the election had been secure and that fraud allegations were baseless or "technically incoherent." "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised," said the agency in a public statement. NBC News reported that the Homeland Security acting secretary had tried to "rein in" Krebs, asking him not to tweet or counter claims being made by Trump.

Donald Trump promptly fired Krebs via tweet, "effective immediately." He had put out a statement, Trump said, that was "highly inaccurate."Senators and representatives spoke out in support Krebs, his expertise and credibility, condemning Trump's move. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) called Krebs' firing "a gut punch to our democracy."

# This Donald Trump Advisor Used the Word 'Transition'—and Scuttled Out of Town [15]

On Tuesday, November 17, White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien slipped out of Washington for a three-country trip to Asia, visiting Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. With a focus on China since becoming national security advisor in September 2019, O'Brien was discussing shared concerns about Beijing's aggressive behavior and South China Sea territorial claims.It was highly unusual for the president's top national security person to leave the capital during a transition. But there was nothing usual about O'Brien, or the Trump administration. Normally a close confidante of the president and the person responsible for the trains running on schedule, Trump's fourth national security man was practically invisible. He did not have the president's ear and, despite being an establishment Republican, was not in the loop of the permanent establishment that was now increasingly worrying about the president and the transition.

His reason for leaving town was not a foreign crisis but a personal one: O'Brien had let slip a remark that contradicted the president. "If the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner—and obviously things look that way now—we'll have a very professional transition from the National Security Council," O'Brien said in a talk at the Global Security Forum. "There's no question about it."And, O'Brien said, in a slap at Trump's refusal to concede and the lack of movement at the White House regarding the transition to Joe Biden, the new administration "deserve[s] some time to come in and implement their policies." In the White House and to President Trump, O'Brien became a non-person.

O'Brien was the first high-level official to break with the president. By contrast, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised a "smooth transition to a second Trump administration." It was shock to the State Department and to the international community, many speculating that Trump might not leave office. Later on Fox News, when asked about all of the foreign leaders who were already congratulating Joe Biden on his win, Pompeo responded "We're reminding everyone that all the votes haven't been counted."

Former prosecutor Rudy Giuliani tried to make that argument before a Pennsylvania court for five hours that Tuesday, one of his first appearances in a courtroom in decades. U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Brann said the Trump campaign's legal argument, "like Frankenstein's Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together from two distinct theories in an attempt to avoid controlling precedent." He dismissed Giuliani's attempt to disqualify thousands of votes as "unhinged," according to the book "I Alone Can Fix It."

Behind the scenes, the National Security Council principals met to discuss Iran and a possible nuclear breakthrough, or any action Tehran might take during the transition to retaliate for the January 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. President Trump had reportedly inquired about military options to strike the primary Iranian nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz. At the meeting, Vice President Mike Pence, Pompeo and General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, agreed that if any military action was taken, it would mean war and then a regional conflict.

CIA director Gina Haspel, who was also in the meeting, later told General Milley, according to Woodward and Costa's "Peril": "This is a highly dangerous situation. We are going to lash out for his ego?" Milley told Pompeo: "We're going to land this plane safely. We've got a plane with four engines and three of them are out. We've got no landing gear. But we're going to land this plane and we're going to land it safely," referring to the transition and the on-again off-again Iran deliberations. Pompeo had skedaddled from Washington on his own foreign trip the previous Saturday, spending the next ten days visiting France, Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Pompeo would arrange a secret meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the normalization of ties and the situation with Iran. When White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked about various statements about the transition and whether Donald Trump would attend the January inauguration, she responded, "I think the president will attend his own inauguration."

# 'I Cannot Wait to Leave This Job,' Said the Acting Defense Chief, a Week Before the Riot [16]

On Wednesday, November 18, nine days after being appointed, Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller started touring the world. Miller had come into the Pentagon reassuring leaders that he wasn't going to do anything radical, even as his entourage of pro-Trump partisans filled key positions. He said little about the transition and nothing about the election fracas, going about the business of introducing himself, calling all of the combatant commanders around the world, dealing with White House requests.

Maybe Miller believed that he was going to be secretary for more than three months (he hasn't spoken out publicly since January 6th), but he then embarked on a global tour of military outposts and allies. He started with a voyage aboard the new aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford on the 18th, and left Washington on November 24th for a Thanksgiving trip to the Middle East, via Germany. In Bahrain, he met with Fifth Fleet leaders and served meals to sailors, flying on to Qatar, where he again served meals and met with U.S. and Air Force leaders and the Qatari Minister of State for Defense Affairs. From Qatar, Miller flew on to Camp Lemonier in Djibouti on the Red Sea coast of the Horn of Africa, again serving meals to military personnel and contractors, meeting as well with troops in Somalia. It was a traditional trip for a Secretary of Defense, to greet American soldiers, sailors, and airmen in war zones, but back in Washington, he took his first overt partisan move, informing members of the Defense Business Board that they were being dismissed or being terminated once their terms expired. There were always partisan slants in appointments to the oversight Board, but the mass dismissal was highly unusual. Two of the replacements announced were Trump lawyer David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's first campaign manager and later a political commentator for One America News Network, Fox News and CNN.

On December 5, Miller again left Washington for to visit U.S. Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii, Indonesia and the Philippines. While he and his chief-of-staff Kash Patel were on the trip, Patel (but not Miller) was called back to Washington by the White House. According to Leonig and Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It," when General Mark Milley heard, he thought another national security official was about to be dismissed. "Milley had never trusted Patel," the book says. "Sometimes in meetings with Miller, when Patel left the room, the acting defense secretary would visibly let his shoulders down, as if he could speak freely." Miller returned to Washington on December 10.

On December 16, Miller flew to Key West, Florida, where he met with the commander of Joint Interagency Task Force South and the commander of the U.S. Southern Command, visiting the special forces underwater operations school as well.On December 20, he was again on the road, to Europe, meeting with commanders and airmen at two airbases in the United Kingdom, before flying on the Afghanistan where he met with the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, in Kabul; as well as General Scott Miller (no relation), Commander of U.S. Forces Afghanistan. Miller announced that the U.S. presence would be down to 2,500 troops by the inauguration. Between his appointment and the end of the year, Miller spent 18 days on the road. The Defense Department's transcript of a January 14 press gaggle with Miller quotes him as saying, "I cannot wait to leave this job, believe me."

# Rudy Giuliani's Melting Hair Dye 'Freak Show' Made Even Donald Trump Flinch [17]

As hair dye dripped down the side of Rudy Giuliani's face during a November 19 press conference at Republican National Committee headquarters, many current and former Trumpers realized that Donald Trump's presidency was over."Oh my God, this is just like a freak show," said a West Wing staffer, according to "I Alone Can Fix It" by Carol D. Leonnig and Philip Rucker. "You see f---ing Rudy's hair dye dripping down his face?" said a video operator on the audio of the Trump campaign's official video feed. Giuliani talked and on, more and more frantic as the show dragged on for an hour and forty minutes, attacking the "fake media" and the "censored" media, who were televising the event."I know crimes, I can smell them," Giuliani said. "You don't have to smell this one, I can prove it to you, 18 different ways. I can prove to you that he won, Pennsylvania, by 300,000 votes. I can prove to you that he won Michigan, probably 50,000 votes."

"You're lying! You're lying! You're lying!" Giuliani screamed at one reporter at one point.It is a massive conspiracy personally directed by Joe Biden, but bankrolled by "communist money," to steal an election that "the president clearly won by a landslide," Giuliani sidekick Sidney Powell said. We are "uncovering more every day," Powell went on, "the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the interference in our elections."

Another Trump lawyer, Jenna Ellis, spoke up to assure the press that facts and figures were forthcoming."This is the 1775 of our generation and beyond!" Powell threatened. "Are these people threatening violent revolution if they don't get their way? Normally I'd say, 'Of course not!'" But the seed was planted.

The news media reveled in the scene. "An apparent hair dye mishap gave critics of Rudy Giuliani another chance to gleefully mock him," USA Today reported. "The most insane 90 minutes," said Vanity Fair, in a story headlined: "Rudy Giuliani's hair dye melting off his face was the least crazy part of his batshit-crazy press conference." Giuliani and the entire election claim of fraud was "Starting to melt," said The New York Times.

Recently fired head of cybersecurity for DHS Cristopher Krebs tweeted: "That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're lucky." Attorney General William Barr and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner dismissed the legal team. Even White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows privately admitted that the Trump presidency was over. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said the message from Meadows was "basically just that we got about 45 days left of the president's term."

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Bob Woodward and Robert Costa that the Rudy and Sidney show was a turning point. "They were just beyond bizarre," Graham said. "And I think it took a lot of the air out of the balloon that the challenges are so unfocused, haphazard and conspiratorial." The news conference "accelerated the beginning of the end," he said. Graham had been a fierce and vociferous supporter of the president, but after the hair dye incident, he even greeted Sen. Kamala Harris, still a sitting senator from California and now the vice president-elect, with a fist bump when she returned to the Capitol. Graham also spoke to Trump on the phone, not the first time, "trying to ease Trump toward acceptance of defeat."

The most important person in the drama, though, remained Donald Trump. And there is evidence now that he too turned. At first the president tweeted: "Evidence of voter fraud continues to grow, including 20,000 dead people on the Pennsylvania voters roll and many thousands all over the Country ..."Trump himself was "unsettled" by the hair dye spectacle and the media mockery, according to Leonnig and Rucker. From then on, the president subtly shifted to trying to convince his supporters that he still had a number of different pathways to overcome the apparent election loss: that no matter what the "lamestream media" was saying, supporters were right to believe that democracy was in peril and that there were conspiracies all around. As the White House increasingly hollowed, with some leaders quarantining after COVID exposures and others looking for post-administration jobs, President Trump stayed in the Oval Office, working the phones and tweeting, more and more isolated in who he talked to, uninterested in the presidency or in governing. The last defense, Trump increasingly argued, rested with "the people," those behind him who now had it on their shoulders to save the nation.

# After Her Family and Pets Were Threatened, She 'Ascertained' the Election [18]

On Friday, November 20, four leading members of the House of Representatives and 41 senators sent letters to GSA Administrator Emily Murphy expressing concern that she had yet to ascertain President-elect Joe Biden as the winner, almost two weeks after news outlets called the race for him. Ascertainment, the letters said, were critical for federal departments and agencies to openly share information with the transition team, especially classified information.

"Your delay in acknowledging Vice President Biden's status as president-elect could undermine efforts by the incoming administration to meet the needs of the American people in a time of national emergency," they said. A delayed transition in the year 2000, commentators said, was blamed for putting the U.S. at greater risk in the lead-up to the 9/11, according to the 9/11 Commission Report, because it harmed George W. Bush's ability to appoint national security personnel.

"The mistake right now of not sharing information with the incoming administration is outrageous," said Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland. "I think it's bad for Donald Trump. It's bad for the Republican Party, bad for the country and our standing in the world. It's diminishing the presidency."

Another concern was that less than a week before the election, President Trump had installed White House lawyer Trent J. Benishek as GSA general counsel. This was after a September 2, 2020 executive order that modified the order of succession within GSA to place the general counsel as fourth-in-line to perform the duties of administrator. If the president fired the top three officials, his man would be in charge. It all looked like a diabolical plan.

Few people outside Washington had ever heard of the General Services Administration. Established in 1949, the GSA is a federal government agency tasked with managing government buildings and real estate, and "acquisition, technology, and other mission-support services across government." In 1963, the Presidential Transition Act then additionally gave the GSA a prominent role in transitions, managing the complex process as well as the most mundane but important tasks, such as moving the incumbents out of the White House and the new president in just hours on the morning of January 20, Inauguration Day.

Caught in the middle of a deeply partisan nation, various election challenges and also reluctant to cross the White House, a week after the 2020 election the GSA established a new website—GSA's Role in Presidential Transitions—that, according to the snapshot on the Internet Wayback Machine, stressed that the GSA did not "pick the winner in the Presidential election."

The agency also tried to explain its role: "The GSA Administrator ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution." The news media declarations and the actual vote count wouldn't be sufficient. The GSA was saying that it had at least until January 6, when Congress certifies the vote, to formally "ascertain" the winner. But practically, the GSA said that "until an ascertainment is made" the agency would provide office space, networks, and expedited background investigations for security clearances. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said during a briefing on Friday afternoon—her first since October 1—that the White House had not put any pressure on GSA and the agency would make the ascertainment decision alone. And that seemed to be true. Though Donald Trump was still agitating about a stolen election, it is now clear that he never talked to Murphy, and also that he was increasingly distanced from any governing. The Biden transition team, led by future White House chief of staff Ron Klain, complained that agencies weren't cooperating with them. The news media was also generally reporting that Trump political appointees had told career officials not to work with the Biden transition team until the GSA ascertainment occurred.

Three days later, Murphy sent president-elect Biden a letter of ascertainment, one that was also deeply personal."To be clear," she wrote, "I did not receive any direction to delay my determination. I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely. Even in the face of thousands of threats, I always remained committed to upholding the law."

The FBI evidently did not take the threats of violence to a high-level government official seriously. (Neither did the mainstream media, which focused narrowly on Trump himself.) Perhaps the number of threats on social media and in real life made these threats seem like they were run-of-the-mill for 2020. Either way, there was a blind spot regarding the fact that there were U.S. citizens who were seditious—and violently disposed.

# Donald Trump Tweeted about 'Massive Corruption,' Demanded Recount, Went Golfing [19]
The Trump campaign formally requested a recount in the state of Georgia on Saturday, November 21. The day before, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had certified President-elect Joe Biden's win and then Georgia Governor Brian Kemp duly certified the appointment of a slate of electors, but President-elect Joe Biden's margin of victory was within 0.5 percent, which meant that the campaign had the right to ask for a formal recount.At this point, the chances of flipping anyone's electoral votes had dwindled to zero. Trump's people focused on signature matching for mail-in ballots, but ironically the recount involved only rescanning all of the paper ballots, not addressing the issue of signatures.

But Donald Trump's strategy had shifted to consolidating his supporters around a general sense of distrust: a belief that there had been cheating and fraud. No one in the White House really believed that there was any way to overturn the election.During the day, the president addressed his fellow heads of state at a G-20 virtual meeting, reportedly telling them he was looking forward to working with them "for a long time," which all interpreted as a statement that he was not ready to concede the election. Trump then boasted about the U.S. military, economy, and COVID-19 vaccine development.

Trump tweeted in the third person: "President Trump has done many great things (biggest tax & regulation cuts in history, Space Force, rebuilding our military, fixing the V.A., the Wall), but perhaps the most important of all will be what he is doing now, exposing the massive corruption in our Electoral Process." Then he went to play golf at one of his own courses in Virginia. COVID continued to wreak havoc in the White House. Andrew Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani's son and a White House aide, tested positive for COVID. So did Donald Trump Jr. "He's been completely asymptomatic so far and is following all medically recommended COVID-19 guidelines," a White House statement said.

An organization called Women for America First filed a permit application for a rally to be held at the Lincoln Memorial on December 12, again to protest the results of the 2020 election. (The group's original application for a rally in Freedom Plaza was denied because of inauguration preparations.) "Women for America First is a pro-Trump, female led group," said the Secret Service in a "Protective Intelligence Brief" issued on January 4, 2021. "The group was the center of organization for both the November and December protests. The group plans to host a 'March for Trump' bus tour from California to Washington, DC, arriving on the January 6, 2021."

Its Facebook group called "STOP THE STEAL" had already been shut down, after gaining hundreds of thousands of members in just days. Before its deletion, the group hosted an events section, which publicized rallies organized by multiple groups occurring across the country. Amy and Kylie Jane Kremer, heads of Women for America First, then took a Facebook group called "Boot Pelosi" and rebranded it as a "March for Trump" group. It promoted the November 14 protests and issued a list of recommended influencers, an amalgam of conspiracy theorists, COVID deniers, white nationalists and anti-Islam activists. Kelly O'Brien, who would later be arrested for her role on January 6, decried in a Facebook group the silencing of pro-Trump groups: "We will not be controlled. It is illegal. We have a duty to Our Country and Our Constitution. TO NOT COMPLY! I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees. PATRIOTS UNTIED [sic]."

# Donald Trump's Former Ally Chris Christie Called Rudy Giuliani a 'National Embarrassment'[20]

"Stop golfing and concede," Republican Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan tweeted at Donald Trump on Sunday, November 22. Hogan said the president's "ridiculous challenges that are not based on fact need to end." "We've always had a peaceful transition of power," he said on CNBC."The president has been saying for months that all mail-in voting was going to be bad and that they were going to be cheating. And look: if there are issues and problems, we ought to root them out," Hogan said on PBS's Firing Line. Donald Trump responded, of course, in a tweet: "Report: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Anti-Trump Hero, Paid for Flawed Coronavirus Tests from South Korea via @BreitbartNews. This (Republican In Name Only) will never make the grade. Hogan is just as bad as the flawed tests he paid big money for!" "If you had done your job," Hogan tweeted in response, "America's governors wouldn't have been forced to fend for themselves to find tests in the middle of a pandemic, as we successfully did in Maryland. Stop golfing and concede."

Hogan had been a consistent and outspoken critic of the president. But Chris Christie? The former governor of New Jersey and an early Trump ally? He appeared on ABC's This Week calling Trump's lawyers a "national embarrassment," saying they were relying on false conspiracy theories rather than evidence of voter fraud. "If you've got the evidence of fraud, present it," he said. "I have been a supporter of the president's. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen."

Christie and presidential campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani then had a bitter phone call. On that Sunday, several more prominent Republicans also called for Trump to end his legal challenges, to concede and to start cooperating in the transition process. Former Ohio Governor John Kasich, who ran against Trump in 2020, and John Bolton, Trump's former national security advisor, said it was important for more Republicans to speak up. Michigan Representative Fred Upton, a Republican, told CNN the voters in his battleground state "spoke" by choosing Joe Biden.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican, said on NBC that it was "past time to start a transition." Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, also a Republican, said Trump should concede because his lawyers had "exhausted all plausible options."

Hope Hicks, the longest-serving Trump political aide, who had returned to the White House in March 2020 and was an active member of the Oval Office entourage, told the president that he should start thinking about his legacy--that focusing on the election too much ran the risk of distracting from all the good he had done. She didn't ask him to concede, which would have been a sure route to being banished, just to think about his legacy.

Everyone close to Trump knew that what he saw on TV was more powerful and resonated more deeply than anything he read or even heard, and they knew he was still spooked by Rudy Giuliani's melting-hair-dye disaster, as well as the near-universal criticism on television of Sidney Powell and her claims of "communist" vote manipulation. His grievance was with the establishment in Washington and New York, and with the deep state and the news media, not Beijing or Caracas.

Rudy Giuliani sensed that the ice under him was thinning. According to Michael Wolff's "Landslide," the family "put it all on Rudy because Rudy was crazy, or drunk, or opportunistic, or all three."Later that day, Giuliani distanced himself from Powell. The campaign released a statement saying Powell was "practicing law on her own" and was not a member of the Trump legal team. It was Powell's fault, the pollster's fault, the campaign's fault, Rudy's fault. No one was really in charge, and though the president was bitter about his Republican defectors, it wasn't his fault.

# 'I Can't Afford a Big Frontal Attack on the President,' Mitch McConnell Confided [21]
On Monday, November 23, Attorney General William Barr met with President Trump in the Oval Office, the first time the two had met or even spoken since mid-October. He had been one of Trump's most loyal cabinet members and an unquestioned conservative. A White House aide had called Barr to tell him that the president was displeased that he hadn't heard from him. According to Woodward and Costa's "Peril," Barr went to the White House where Trump complained about election fraud, telling the Attorney General that he had heard that the Justice Department was "hanging back." Trump asked why Justice wasn't looking into the reports. "It's not our role to take sides between you and the other candidate," Barr answered. "That's what we have elections to decide."

Trump insisted that Justice should investigate, that there was a "crime of sufficient magnitude" that could affect the outcome, and Barr agreed that Justice would look into allegations on a "case-by-case" basis.
Barr had already instructed U.S. Attorneys around the nation to review all credible allegations of substantial fraud. Sixteen Assistant U.S. Attorneys in fifteen districts urged Barr to cease the investigation because there was no evidence of irregularities. Richard Pilger, head of the Justice Department's election crimes branch, resigned in protest.

The investigations turned up nothing. According to Carol D. Leonnig and Philip Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It," "Barr told his senior deputies that at some point someone was going to have to say that the emperor has no clothes. The question was when." None of that was conveyed to the president, who continued to tighten his circle. From the outside Barr looked like a Trump apologist, or even co-conspirator, though the evidence now suggests that Barr was just humoring the president.

At the White House that day, Barr urged Trump to protect his legacy, to focus on "all the great things you've accomplished. "Be positive," he said to Trump. "Then go down to Georgia and make sure the Republicans hold the Senate." Barr was reportedly so alarmed by Donald Trump's mindset from the meeting, he told the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner that things were "getting out of hand." The two assured him that the president was easing into his defeat, as evidenced by his outward support of the beginning of transition preparations for President-elect Joe Biden.

"I had no motive to suppress" any actual evidence of fraud or impropriety, Barr later told Jonathan Karl in his new book "Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show." "But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit." Barr then spoke to Mitch McConnell. The Senate majority leader hadn't spoken up and was therefore portrayed as pro-Trump, but was actually one of the few high-level elected officials who was thinking strategically at the time, his actions matching his words. He told Barr they still needed Trump to focus on Georgia ahead of the January 5 runoff election that would determine if Republicans held the Senate. "I can't afford a big frontal attack on the president at this point," McConnell told Barr.

According to both "Betrayal" and "Peril," McConnell felt that he couldn't declare Joe Biden the winner, fearful that his pronouncement would provoke Donald Trump into doing something like sabotage the Georgia race, or worse. "You're in a better position to inject some reality into this situation," he pleaded with Barr. "You are really the only one who can do it."

"I understand that," Barr said. "And I'm going to do it at the appropriate time." Over the next few days, McConnell urged Barr "to come out and shoot down the talk of widespread fraud. "Bill, I look around, and you are the only person who can do it," McConnell said. A week later, all of his ducks in order, Barr broke with the president.

# 'Anyone Who Opposes Trump Supporters' Could Disrupt Capitol Rally, Planners Feared [22]

The original permit application, filed on November 24, set the demonstration in Washington for January 22 and 23, the days after the Inauguration and long after the electoral vote count in Congress. The setting: Freedom Plaza and the Lincoln Memorial. The expected attendance, the application said, was 5,000, even though 11,000 people had attended the November 14 event, also sponsored by Women for America First. In the requisite federal form filed that day, the organization said that the "First Amendment Rally" might be disrupted by "anyone who opposes conservatives, Trump supporters, or Republicans." That was the only mention of Donald Trump. It seemed simple and straightforward, except no one in the federal or District of Columbia governments ever believed it would be.

The National Park Service, responsible for security of the Mall and monuments, including the Ellipse, started corresponding with demonstration organizers on November 14, the day of the first Trump demonstration in Washington, with 11,000 attending. "Right now," an NPS official wrote in an email, "it sounds like there may be more internet traffic than actual attendees but they are expecting pro-Trump groups and counter groups." On December 21, Women for America First, stated in an email to the NPS that they were relinquishing January 22-23 for the Lincoln Memorial and Freedom Plaza and instead were requesting January 5-7. Those who might disturb the demonstration were now listed as "anyone who opposes election integrity, conservatives, Trump supporters, or Republicans."

Just two weeks away, the organizers now predicted 15,000 attendees. The Park Service wrote in an internal email that they needed to find "a location suitable for 15,000," telling the organizers that Freedom Plaza and the Lincoln Memorial were no longer available. It is not clear in any of the documents released by NPS or leaked to the press since January 6 how the Ellipse, just south of the White House and adjacent to the Mall, emerged as the prospective venue. Officially, another application update was filed on December 29, the venue now moved to the Ellipse. Organizers said that the demonstration would run from approximately 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Prospective speakers included representatives from various pro-Trump organizations, members of Congress, Rudy Giuliani, and Roger Stone. (Donald Trump hadn't yet declared that he would speak).

"Women for America First will not conduct an organized march from the Ellipse at the conclusion of the rally," the permit issued stated. It was expected that some participants might leave the Ellipse to attend additional rallies at the Capitol "to hear the results of Congressional certification of the Electoral College count."

The organizers and the Park Service agreed that the event would take place in the southwest quadrant of the Ellipse, south of the Christmas Tree Lighting Site. During the period of the rally, the Park Service stated, "All areas are always to remain open to the general public." The demonstration organizers said that they recognized "the significant concerns to public health resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic." They pledged to use CDC guidance and best practices, to wear masks and practice social distancing.The National Park Service Record of Determination blithely stated that the event: "will not adversely affect the park's natural, aesthetic or cultural values and is not of a highly controversial nature." Thousands of emails about the rally were exchanged inside the Park Service, within the federal government and with the District of Columbia government, all the responsible agencies—there were many—and the event organizers. There is no evidence that any of the coordination included the FBI or the Pentagon. It was all very friendly.

All of the internal correspondence regarded concerns about the structures that might be built on the Ellipse, from the stage to the Jumbotron screens, about seating, tents, lighting, flags and bunting, fire and safety of the participants, what would and would not be allowed on Park lands, the provision of porta-potties and hand-washing stations, crowd flow into and out of the event, the presence of vendors, street closures and parking, emergency medical preparations, food truck permits, recycling and trash containers, photographers at the top of the Washington Monument, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, protection of the grass on Park lands, protection of the steam lines that ran underneath the Ellipse, protection of the "sanctity of the National Mall," particularly the preservation of the sightline that existed between the White House and the Jefferson Memorial, which by law could not be blocked. One Park Service internal email, worrying about the structures being built, sums up the federal government's concern. "I can't help but think if we authorize (permit) erection of hazards on our land and don't make reasonable effort by qualified staff to assure a minimum level of safety of applicable fire rules and regulations, we are liable." Liable to be sued, not liable for the outcome.

# Loyal Donald Trump Pardoned Mike Flynn, Who'd Gone Down a QAnon Rabbit Hole [23]

On November 25, as the Thanksgiving weekend neared and the formal government transition to a Biden-Harris administration began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 30,000 points for the first time. Joe Biden's transition legal team met with the FBI and Justice Department to begin the background check process for high-level appointees. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News, "We'll do everything that's required by law. We'll make this work."

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said in an internal memorandum to Trump administration appointees that they would "comply with all actions needed to ensure the smooth transfer of power." However, he forbade any communications with the Biden team "unless specifically authorized." Those who work in the Office of the President "are not permitted to speak directly with a member of the Biden transition team or the federal transition coordinator," he wrote.

Tweeting that the General Services Administration has been "terrific," the still recalcitrant President Trump gave his blessing to the transition as well, adding that "... Emily Murphy has done a great job, but the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be." In fact, the presidential election results were formally certified in Pennsylvania that day, and Governor Tom Wolf signed the Certificate of Ascertainment, making the certification of Pennsylvania's electors conclusive.

Donald Trump fought on, though, and in a sign of his allegiance to his most loyal defenders, the president pardoned retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, his first national security advisor who'd been forced to resign in light of news reports that he lied to Vice President Mike Pence and others regarding conversations he had with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. Flynn served for 22 days in January and February 2017. `It was reported that Flynn, along with son-in-law Jared Kushner, tried to facilitate the transfer of nuclear technology from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia, for use in a proposed joint U.S.-French-Russian-British project. And he was being investigated for illegal lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government. In the first days of the Trump administration, he told the White House Counsel Don McGahn that he was under federal investigation for his dealing with Turkey, that he had not reported his lobbying, as was required by law. Flynn subsequently reached a deal to plead guilty to a felony charge and agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller—mostly to save his son, who was also implicated in Flynn's Turkish business dealings.

In June 2019, Flynn dismissed his conventional attorneys and hired Sidney Powell, the later Rudy Giuliani sidekick. Powell started speaking publicly about the Flynn case, saying that the retired general should be exonerated. Reports circulated that she talked to President Trump more than once about Flynn. With Powell's guidance, in January 2020 Flynn withdrew his guilty plea, claiming government vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement in their continuing to pursue charges. The Justice Department then filed a court motion to drop all charges on May 7, 2020. The status of the case was still pending when Flynn was issued his full pardon.

But the man who roared "lock her up" at the Republican National Convention in 2016 and delivered a blistering attack on Hillary Clinton, further fell into world of conspiracy theories. Flynn hosted a QAnon event leading others in an oath to the organization. All during 2020, QAnon mounted an aggressive social media campaign arguing that COVID was manufactured in the Chinese laboratory and that the virus was part of a vast conspiracy to control the population. They argued that Black Lives Matter protests were not just being supported by dark forces of the "deep state" but that all the summer protests after George Floyd's death were violent. But most important, QAnon argued that a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles were secretly pulling the strings in Washington and the mainstream media. A December 2020 poll by NPR/Ipsos concluded that fewer than 47 percent of those polled couldn't correctly identify this statement as false: "A group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media."

Flynn became a major proselytizer of a stolen election hidden behind the very deep state that he was a member of. The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency would say in speeches that "the people decide" who is president, not the courts or the elites. "I will tell you one more time—because I've been asked ... on a scale of one to ten, who will be the next president of the United States, and I say Donald Trump. Ten. A ten."

"I don't know what happened to Mike," a retired Army general who had been a colleague of General Flynn's told Newsweek. The general requested anonymity because he didn't want to have his name publicly revealed. Flynn, he said, was a dynamic leader and brilliant intelligence officer, always pushing for a more aggressive and focused intelligence effort, as well as for less secrecy with American allies in the war on terrorism. "Is it the allure of social media, of being a star and a so-called influencer?" the general said. "I just don't know, but I've watched some national security leaders, who are otherwise cautious men, descend into tweeting and building their brand, saying things that are extreme and intemperate, shaking my head." "Maybe, thrown out of the lobbying and consulting world, Mike sees MAGA as his new client, hoping to score a payday promoting these ideas. I don't think he believes any of it. But if he does, God help us."

# 'You Play Golf, Right?' Donald Trump Rambled On as Commanders Tried to Interrupt [24]

"The foundations are ready for one of the best years we've ever had," Donald Trump said in a 45-minute video teleconference on Thanksgiving, November 26, speaking to service members around the world, hinting at a second term. It would be a startling performance, even for him. "Our nation is doing very well. It's the highest honor of my life to serve as your Commander-in-Chief," he said. The president then called out specific units and commanders in Kuwait, in the Red Sea, at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and with his new Space Force, as he repeated a number of times. "You keep watch around the world to detect missile launches, space launches, and nuclear detonations while providing critical intelligence," he said to the commander of the 11th Space Warning Squadron in Colorado. "All of you are pioneers in the newest branch of our armed forces."

"We've been building up our military," he bragged. "We spent $2.5 trillion in the last three and a half years. And we've never had anything like it. ... All new tanks and missiles and rockets," all of it to be delivered in the next six to 12 months, "all of it made in the USA."

Speaking to the commander and crew of the destroyer USS Winston Churchill, Trump said: "We're building a lot of ships right now, as you know, and you'll have them very soon."

Speaking to a Coast Guard unit in Cuba, he said: "You have brand new Coast Guard ships, and it's my honor to have gotten them for you."

"You know, when we took over, our military was very depleted," Trump said. "You know that very well."

"When I came in four years ago—hard to believe, almost four years ago—we were in sad shape. And now we're in phenomenal shape."

"We went from old planes to brand new planes," he told an Air Force commander in the Middle East, "from planes that were very visible to stealth, where you can't see them."

"A president—four years, no wars," he went on. "We stopped wars. And we won, as you know, 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. We've done a job."

A half-dozen commanders around the world delivered solemn prepared remarks, thanking their men and women, describing their missions. Donald Trump hardly paid attention to the members of the armed forces, blustering instead about his own greatness and his claimed accomplishments. Nothing, other than the Space Force, could fairly be credited to the president. The United States was still "at war" all over the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. No ships or tanks or airplanes were being produced at a rate any greater than during the previous three administrations. Trump was not responsible in any way for stealth planes. And though President Barack Obama might have pledged disarmament and reductions in defense spending, there had been no real reduction, and America's troops were pretty much in the same state as they had been for a decade.

At one point the president appeared to wander off into a conversation with himself. "Thank you very much," he said. "That's great. That's really great. Are you a golfer? Do you play golf? You love it, right? That's good. It's pretty good. Thank you very much. The only form of exercise. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And really, everybody, just congratulations."

When a soldier asked if the president had plans for Thanksgiving, Trump proceeded to talk about the elections. "They're finding tremendous discrepancies in the votes. Nobody believes those numbers. Those numbers are incorrect numbers." He talked about false ballots and recounts and fake signatures; the more he talked, the more he got lost in his own head, rambling on and on as incredulous members of the armed forces tried to interrupt. 
"But..," they said. "Mr. President...," they tried to say, asking more than once if the president would concede the election.Trump talked over them. "We're like a third-world country. We have machines that nobody knows what the hell they're looking at. I mean, you take a look at all the mistakes they made."

Michigan. Pennsylvania. Georgia. Wisconsin. Arizona. Texas. He mentioned them all. "We'll see what happens. Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has ... has really come to represent." They want to get rid of 'America First,' he told the soldiers, sailors, airmen and women, Marines, Coast Guards, and Space Force guardians on the call, "I mean, they want to get rid of 'America First.' They don't want 'America First.' You know why? Because China doesn't want it. China expressed their wish: 'Please get rid of "America First.'" And the Biden administration said, 'Oh, that's okay. We'll get rid of 'America First.'

"So I don't know what is going to happen," he continued. "I know one thing: Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes. It was a rigged election—100 percent—and people know it.... People say the votes are counted in foreign countries."

Referring to the upcoming Senate runoff vote in Georgia, he spoke of the Democratic candidate, not remembering his name. "But he's either a communist or a socialist. Probably a communist. This is not for Georgia."

At one point, the soliloquy was interrupted by an unidentified reporter in the Oval Office, watching the show.

"You won't concede?" he asked.

"It's a possibility they're trying to—look, between you people..."

"Just answer the question about concession," the reporter pressed.

"Don't talk to me that way," Trump said.

"I'm sorry, sir, I'm just asking you to ..."

"You're just a—you're just a lightweight," Trump sputtered.

"Answer the question about concession," the reporter repeated.

"Don't talk to me that—don't talk to—I'm the President of the United States. Don't ever talk to the president that way," Trump said.

"Sir, I'm just asking you to answer the question about concession," the reporter said.

"All right," Trump responded. "I'm going to go with another question. Go ahead."

But Trump didn't take another question. He went on talking for another 10 minutes, talking about fraud and a stolen election as the reporter continued to press his questions, asking numerous times about conceding, about why the president wasn't producing the actual fraudulent votes, about him leaving the White House. Donald Trump talked on. At one point he called the Republican Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, an "enemy of the people". "If the media was honest in this country—which, you know, for the most part, they're not—this would never have happened, he said. "What they did is they use COVID in order to defraud the people of this country. And the whole world is watching and the whole world is laughing at our electoral process. The whole world is watching. And it's a very sad thing. A very sad thing.""You know that it's tradition for previous presidents to go to the next president's inauguration. So will you attend Joe Biden's?" the reporter asked. "I don't want to say that yet," the president answered.

# 'Tyrants and Traitors Need to Be Executed,' Said the Army-Vet-Conspiracy-Theorist [25]

On November 27, San Clemente, California, yoga practitioner, wellness and New Age leader Alan Hostetter, 56, who would later be indicted for his role in the riot at the U.S. Capitol, posted a video of himself on his own American Phoenix Project YouTube channel talking about his attendance at the November 14 "Million MAGA" March in Washington. "People at the highest levels need to be made an example of with an execution or two or three," Hostetter said. "Because when you commit treason against this country and you disenfranchise the voters of this country and you take away their ability to make decisions for themselves, you strip them of their Constitution rights. That's not hyperbole when we call it tyranny, that's fucking tyranny. And tyrants and traitors need to be executed as an example ..."

Hostetter, who had previously served with law enforcement for more than a decade, rising to be Chief of Police for La Habra, California, had turned to the southern California spiritual side, proselytizing peace and tranquility before 2020, when COVID lockdown seems to have radicalized him. He started to embrace conspiracy theories, speaking at a QAnon conference. Soon he started saying that California Gov. Gavin Newsom should be hanged and that traitors to the country "need to be executed as an example."

In a sworn Grand Jury statement, the FBI later said that Hostetter "used the American Phoenix Project as a platform to advocate violence against certain groups and individuals that supported the 2020 presidential election results." He argued on YouTube that votes for Donald Trump had been "switched" to Joe Biden and otherwise "stolen"; he appeared as a speaker at "Stop the Steal" protests. He was highly regarded by the right-wing movement as an Army veteran with a long career in law enforcement.

Upcoming protests, he said in November, were going "to be a shot across the bow of the deep state when they see a million Patriots surrounding that shit hole of a city—the swamp." The Patriots, he threatened, were going to surround the city if the election wasn't resolved "peacefully and soon ..." At one point, according to NPR, Hostetter and others gathered outside the house of Democratic Mayor Katrina Foley of Costa Mesa, California, to protest what Hostetter called a "dictatorship" and an "unlawful, unscientific, ineffective and dangerous mask mandate."

After the election, according to prosecutors, Hostetter spoke about a stolen election and became involved with the Three Percenters (%ers, III%ers, and Threepers). A 2014 NYPD intelligence division report says the Three Percenters are a modern counterpart to a mythical three percent of American Revolutionary-era patriots who fought and are also the alleged percent of the population of American gun owners who will not disarm. A New Jersey 2015 report says the anti-government group, which justifies the use of violence to counter perceived threats to the Constitution, was one of the leaders of the militia movement.

In August 2017, Jerry Drake Varnell, 23, was caught in an FBI sting while attempting to bomb a BancFirst building in Oklahoma City. Varnell, who subscribed to the Three Percenter ideology, planned the attack for months, watched as a 1,000-pound bomb was assembled, drove it in a van to an alley next to the BancFirst building, and then twice dialed a cell-phone number in order to detonate it before being arrested. "'Three Percenters,' who were counted among attendees at the 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville ... believe that, as patriots, they must protect against a tyrannical government, particularly regarding infringement on Second Amendment rights," the NYPD said in a 2017 report.

On December 19, when President Trump tweeted that the upcoming protest in Washington, D.C., would be "wild," Hostetter posted on his American Phoenix Project Instagram account: "I will be there, bullhorns on fire, to let the swamp dwellers know we will not let them steal our country from us. I hope you can join me!"

Before January 6, Hostetter replied to a message from other group members who were planning to go to Washington as whether he was "brining firearms" to the capital. According to prosecutors, he replied: "NO NEVER (Instagram now monitors all text messages ... this has been a public service announcement)" and three added three crying/laughing emoji. On January 5, Hostetter spoke at the Rally To Save America in front of the Supreme Court, wearing his patent fedora with an American flag bandana around the base. "We are at war in this country, we are at war tomorrow," Hostetter told the crowd. During the protests on January 6, Hostetter posted a video from the Capitol steps, saying: "The people have taken back their house! I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful sight in my whole life."

Hostetter was arrested by the FBI on June 10, 2021. His Grand Jury indictment says he conspired "to obstruct, influence, and impede" the January 6 joint session of Congress. He plead not guilty to four charges, including conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. His attorney at the time, Bilal Essayli, pointed out that Hostetter was not charged with entering the Capitol, nor did the FBI claim that he engaged in any acts of violence or possessed any weapon. "He was there to protest and exercise his First Amendment Right," Essayli said. "He was charged with multiple felony counts and I think it's just very troubling as an American citizen."

At a public town hall event held on Zoom after January 6, Hostetter said prosecutors "connected me to Three Percenters in the indictment that I don't believe I've ever even met or had any contact with whatsoever." Hostetter announced last month that he was going to represent himself at trial. When the judge insisted that he at least accept a legal advisor to assist, Hostetter, according WUSA9 television in Washington DC, he said he wanted a legal advisor with no association with Skull & Bones, Free Masonry "or any other organizations that require oaths or vows of secrecy."

"Secret Societies (Freemasonry/Yale's Skull and Bones/Kabbalah, etc) are Luciferian death cults corrupting every aspect of our lives," Hostetter says on LinkedIn. "They must be destroyed so humanity might be saved. Grateful to God for my awakening." When contacted last month, Hostetter declined to be interviewed by Newsweek, calling it "fake news."

# Intelligence Analysts 'Didn't Understand Donald Trump, How Far He Would Go' [26]

On Saturday November 28, according to the local news site New Jersey.com, a "Stop the Steal" caravan involving dozens of demonstrators traveled around the state for several hours to support Donald Trump and his election claims. The caravan ended at Governor Phil Murphy's home, where the protestors shifted to criticizing COVID shutdowns, calling for the reopening of New Jersey. Festooned with Trump flags and signs, the caravan moved to the sound of honks of encouragement.

It was just one protest, not worthy of national attention. According to MSA Security," a private security company, eight protests were planned for that Saturday, in California, New York, and Oregon. "Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are reportedly warning officials of the increased chances of political violence amid ongoing election disputes," the company said. "Calls for civil unrest and possible violence have flooded social media," the company said. There is no tangible evidence that anyone was being warned. Neither the FBI nor the Department of Homeland Security kept a nationwide list of demonstrations. The FBI's effort focused on specific acts of potential terrorism, particularly bombings and other catastrophic attacks. The DHS served the nationwide network of state and urban-level fusion centers, funneling them open-source and investigative information. The primary focus was forecasting threats to law enforcement and "critical infrastructure, but also obsessions with new threats, such as countering unmanned aerial systems (drones)."

"DHS doesn't report on first amendment demonstrations per se," a contractor who works in the domestic intelligence world told Newsweek. He requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about government intelligence gathering and reporting. The first amendment label, the contractor said, isn't concocted or immaterial. "Balancing monitoring and protecting people's rights to protest is a constant struggle. So the intelligence system naturally gravitates towards the safer and less controversial subjects." One organization that does focus on nationwide protests and tracks trends is the U.S. Crisis Monitor at Princeton University. Their Regional Overview: The United States, 22-28 November 2020 reported that demonstrations decreased by half for the week, when compared with the previous week. "Demonstrations have declined overall in the weeks since the election," Crisis Monitor reported. With Donald Trump officially authorizing the transition process to begin, the report said, "the total number of election-related demonstrations significantly decreased." Election-related demonstrations declined from a high of over 300 during the week of the election "to less than a tenth of that number over the past week."

Crisis Monitor reports that the majority of demonstration around the country (just over half) didn't relate at all to the elections but were focused on COVID. Even there, though, coronavirus-related events remained below levels seen earlier in the year. More than half of these COVID demonstrations, the report said, were against government regulations and state-level restrictions. Demonstrations in support of government measures accounted for 40 percent of all COVID-related demonstration events. The "Stop the Steal" demonstrations, the report said, "seem to have lost momentum." Groups like the Proud Boys and Three Percenters were increasingly visible, with the group present in more than a quarter of election-related demonstrations. "Other armed militia groups"—including the New York Watchmen and Patriot Prayer—were present at various demonstrations across the country.

"Almost two dozen demonstrations associated with the BLM [Black Lives Matter] movement were recorded during the week," the report said, also a significant decrease. When presented with these numbers, the homeland security contractor said that much of the decline probably related to the Thanksgiving holiday and didn't reflect an actual longer term threat. He said the November 14 rally in Washington was dismissed by most observers and analysts, that the demonstration itself was "a bust," and was also dominated by a few violent agitators. "I don't think we could say that any insurrection or seditious activity was yet forming."

Did the FBI or homeland security ignore the right-wing protestors because there were analysts who were sympathetic to their cause? The contractor didn't subscribe to that idea. "Did half vote for Donald Trump?" he asked rhetorically. "Maybe so and perhaps even more." But he felt that in the ranks, the workers were scrupulously impartial, interested as much in identifying a right-wing as a left-wing threat to the government. "I can't say the same for the homeland security leadership," he said, "and that certainly influenced how far preparations could go." But then, he said, "the intelligence and law enforcement analysts also didn't understand Donald Trump, how far he would go. Because when it comes to threats to governance and the Constitution by those actually in power, no one in the federal government really bears any responsibility for thwarting that." 

# Donald Trump Must Have a Diabolical Plan, Officials Assumed. But There Was No Plan [27]

On November 29, President Donald Trump gave his first TV interview since the election, appearing on "Sunday Morning Futures" with Maria Bartiromo. The president spoke for 46 minutes over the phone and delivered an extended monologue, going through his litany of evidence of voter fraud, calling the election a "fraud" and "rigged." Trump accused his own government of not doing enough. "This is total fraud. And how the FBI, and Department of Justice—I don't know, maybe they're involved—but how people are allowed to get away with this is stuff is unbelievable," he said, arguing that Justice was "missing in action." As the interview ended, Trump implied that he was not going to concede even after Joe Biden entered the Oval Office. "It's not like you're going to change my mind," he said. "In other words, my mind will not change in six months."

The Washington Post described the interview as "baseless, conspiracy-fueled allegations about voter fraud.""A long tirade, repeating over and over again his baseless claim there was widespread voter fraud in the election even as his team keeps losing legal cases," Slate reported."Outrageous assertions," said Raw Story. His facts and his arguments were false, the mainstream media universally said. He had lost lawsuit after lawsuit. He had failed to produce any evidence.

What Donald Trump might do—in not conceding, in rallying his base, in ignoring the votes—introduced an uncertainty in the minds of even his own national security cabinet members, who feared that he might try to coopt the military or even declare martial law. It looked to them that he must have a diabolical plan.

But there was no plan. Donald Trump the president was never fully engaged in policy—he never developed any passion to be the chief executive. He never sank his teeth into the details of anything, operating solely from his own feelings, defying over and over again the recommendations (and cautiousness) of his own experts and advisors. He had no interest in the necessary alliances or coalitions in the world or in domestic politics, the very relationships that might facilitate a coup.

The absence of a conventional president drove the orderly, results-oriented government crazy. Officials were both shocked and filled the void. The very government Trump loathed—the so-called deep state—gathered more power because of the way Trump ran the country. His own Cabinet members, military advisors, credentialed experts and politicians all failed to understand that there was a wide gulf between the actual presidency and the man's theater of the presidency. The two personas weren't so divergent, if you stopped giving Donald Trump too much credit for any plan or any intention other than fueling the Donald Trump show.

Yet a vast number of Americans agreed with the great disruptor, either the man or the president: those who were themselves skeptics and haters of the elite, those who were disgruntled and unbelieving, not accepting the science, not accepting the numbers. The more the mainstream lampooned his 70-plus-million-strong voting bloc—that they were all uneducated idiots, survivalists and gun crazy extremists, white supremacists and militias, anti-vaxxers and even terrorists—the more the base solidified, if not around Donald Trump then around a complex and multi-dimensional rejection of all things Washington. The mainstream convinced themselves that Donald Trump was leading, pulling the strings of this unruly and intransigent army. But Trump wasn't leading anything. As the star of the show, Donald Trump had contempt for his own audience, privately calling his fans "the unwashed." He was uninterested in anything but adulation and the effect on his imaginary Neilson ratings, which continued to rise.

'Enemies Foreign and Domestic'? Threats the Daily Intelligence Briefs Left Out [28]

On November 30, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received their first President's Daily Brief, Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, and Senator Harris at a secure room in the Commerce Department in Washington. In 2016, Donald Trump had received his first PDB, as it is known, less than a week after the election. Trump had been given the same briefing as Barack Obama, and Biden and Harris received the same briefing that Donald Trump received that day. The PDB, the most secret and limited circulation newsletter, is read in the White House and among the highest level national security officials. Biden had regularly received the PDB as Vice President. Harris received her first-ever PDB.

According to an intelligence community official involved in the preparation of the PDB, the briefing this day dealt with Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and China, and also touched on COVID, terrorism and the economy. Additional items created just for Biden and Harris included a tour of the latest intelligence from around the world as well as forecasts regarding threats. The two also got the first of a number of briefings on CIA covert actions around the world—covert actions that Biden would inherit on January 20.

"From my experience with then-Vice President Biden, he was an avid reader and in general a voracious consumer of intelligence," Obama's last director of national intelligence, retired Gen. James Clapper, said on CNN. "I'm sure he will be especially so as president." Trump, on the other hand, often skipped getting the PDB and hardly ever scrutinized the written report, instead relying on live oral briefings, videos and extensive graphics prepared for his consumption. ("Michelle called it 'The Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,'" Obama wrote in "A Promised Land," his memoir. "On a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems," and "nearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable—a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9/11.")

And then there was the issue of Trump political appointees being quietly converted to fulltime civil servants. There was the prospect, Congressional Democrats argued, that the outgoing administration would seed the government with potential saboteurs. Leaders of nearly two dozen House committees demanded information from 61 federal agencies on any efforts to convert political appointees to career civil service positions ahead of President-elect Biden's inauguration.

Another letter, this one from the House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) inquired about a Trump plan to exempt high level policy-making positions from normal civil service performance measures. Maloney argued that this would undermine the merit systems that form the very basis of the civil service. The news media fretted that the two-week delay in the transition jeopardized the country. It was a legacy 9/11 concern, that a potential terrorist strike from abroad could happen during the transition, or that one of the four perpetual adversaries—China, Russia, Iran or North Korea—would make a move to test the new administration or even to attack outright. But the national threat was focused outward, from foreign sources. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI could forward warnings of domestic threats to the Director of National Intelligence for inclusion in President's Daily Briefs, but there is no evidence that domestic threats ever made it into the hallowed document. It was another blind spot that would become apparent on January 6, that "enemies foreign and domestic" was just a phrase.

# 'You Must Really Hate Trump,' a Furious Donald Trump Said to Bill Barr [29]

On December 1, the dam finally broke. Attorney General William Barr invited Associated Press reporter Mike Balsamo to lunch, telling him on the record that he was breaking with President Donald Trump."Disputing President Donald Trump's persistent, baseless claims, Attorney General William Barr declared Tuesday the U.S. Justice Department has uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election," the AP reported. "We have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election," Barr said.

"There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results," Barr said, referring to Sidney Powell's allegations that elections systems that stored results in Germany had flipped votes, and the software created in Venezuela "at the direction of Hugo Chavez" was capable of changing votes. "The DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that," Barr went on, referring to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice. (Hugo Chavez died in 2013.) The reaction from the Trump campaign was immediate. Rudy Giuliani issued a statement claiming that, "with all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn't been any semblance" of an investigation into the president's complaints.

But the most painful part of the day was Barr's visit to the White House for a previously scheduled meeting with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, where he was called into the Oval Office. Barr met with Donald Trump for three hours. The president continued to rail against the vote outcome, repeating some of the same claims of fraud and a stolen election. He asked Barr about his quotes in the AP story. "You must have said that because you hate Trump, you must really hate Trump."

Barr tells the president that he thinks the White House has no strategy. He says, according to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's "Peril" that "every self-respecting lawyer in the country has run for the hills. Your team is a bunch of clowns. ... You have wasted four weeks on the one theory that is demonstrably crazy, which is these machines."

"Barr had never seen Trump in such a fury," the authors write in "Peril." "If a human being can have flames coming out of his ears, this was it. Barr imagined the flames. He had never seen Trump madder." Senator Chuck Schumer is quoted as saying: "I guess he's the next one to be fired." Meadows asked Barr not to resign before January 20. He agreed to stay on if the president wanted him to, but, according to "Peril," "Barr immediately regretted saying he would stay ... Trump was not listening to him, and the attorney general was now a figurehead at best."

That night, Barr had dinner with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and they commiserated about Trump and the potential dangers to the country. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Army Gen. Mark Milley later called Barr, saying "you can't leave now. We need you," begging him to stay on to January 20. The silent coup plotters of the government, cabinet members now untethered from the president, worried that something terrible was ahead: there were still almost two months before the inauguration of Joe Biden.

In Colorado Springs, U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) was holding a two-day conference on threats to North America, including extensive panels on its mission of homeland defense: "deterring, detecting, and defeating threats to the United States." "The command is assigned forces whenever necessary to execute missions, as ordered by the president or secretary of defense," the command says in its official mission statement. "Per the Posse Comitatus Act, military forces can provide civil support, but cannot become directly involved in law enforcement," it says. All during COVID, the command coordinated nationwide National Guard response, even if those guard forces stayed under control of state governors.

Created after 9/11, NORTHCOM "consolidates under a single unified command existing missions that were previously executed by other DOD organizations," but it had really developed to coordinate the air defense of North America and then missile defense as well. It became involved in the drug war, the military efforts on the border, and support to civil authorities in a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina. The command took charge of assisting local authorities should there be a weapon-of-mass-destruction event inside the United States. And finally, during the Obama administration, it also took on, in its own words, efforts to "protect our nations' critical infrastructure."

It was a jumble of missions, some that seemed remote as the world evolved in its 18-year existence. There were secret operations and contingency plans behind the scenes, shadowy task forces and compartmented plans for emergencies in Washington and for continuity of the presidency and the government in case of an attack. There was Special Operations Command North, established during the Obama administration, with special operators skulking around at the southern border and in Mexico, but also having domestic mission. And there were other under-the-table projects that hinted at what was going on in highly classified corners. That day there was a panel: "Combatting False Information in Social Media via Machine Learning," evidently another threat to the homeland and an effort to defend it. Except that, in every way, as January 6 neared, NORTHCOM was completely absent, the Pentagon deciding what the military response would be.


# Donald Trump Should Declare Martial Law, Michael Flynn Retweeted from His Now-Banned Account [30]

"Freedom never kneels except for God," retired Michael Flynn tweeted on December 2, sharing an advertisement from the We the People Convention, an Ohio activist group. In the ad, the Convention asks President Donald Trump "to exercise the Extraordinary Powers of his office and declare limited Martial Law to temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections in order to have the military implement a national re-vote that reflects the true will of the people."

Trump had granted a full pardon to Michael Flynn, his first national security advisor, just eight days earlier. Flynn had already joined the Trump campaign and its most vociferous lawyer—Sidney Powell—in promoting the wildest conspiracy theories about a stolen election. And though his December 2 tweet was a retweet, and Flynn never explicitly mentioned martial law, behind the scenes the retired Army general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency pushed Trump campaign lawyers and the president himself to use the military to intervene in the results of the vote. Flynn, in a later Newsmax interview, said that Donald Trump had "options" to maintain the integrity of the election. "The president has to plan for every eventuality because we cannot allow this election and the integrity of our election to go the way it is,'' Flynn said.

"He could immediately on his order seize every single one of these machines around the country on his order. He could also order, within the swing states, if he wanted to, he could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states. It's not unprecedented," Flynn added."These people out there talking about martial law like it's something we've never done," Flynn told Newsmax. "Martial law has been instituted 64 times. I'm not calling for that. We have a constitutional process. ... That has to be followed. But I will tell you I'm a little concerned about Chief Justice John Roberts at the Supreme Court. We can't fool around with the fabric of the Constitution of the United States.

"Clearly there is a foreign influence that is tied to this system and it goes back to China, likely gets to Russia, likely goes to Iran," he said talking about the Dominion voting machines. "There's been problems all over the country with them."

In his new book, "Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show," Jonathan Karl writes that Flynn and Powell tried to enlist Trump's post-election appointee Ezra Cohen-Watnick to help overturn the election. According to Karl, Flynn called Cohen-Watnick, who previously worked for him at DIA and whom Flynn had hired in the first month of the Trump administration to staff the National Security Council, to return from the Middle East "immediately because there were big things about to happen." In "Betrayal," Flynn is quoted telling Cohen-Watnick: "We need you ... there was going to be an epic showdown over the election results." Cohen-Watnick was needed "to get orders signed, that ballots needed to be seized, and that extraordinary measures needed to be taken to stop Democrats from stealing the election," Flynn reportedly said.

"Sir, the election is over," Cohen-Watnick told Flynn, according to his own account in "Betrayal." "It's time to move on," the former aide told Flynn. Flynn, according to Karl's account, shot back: "You're a quitter! This is not over! Don't be a quitter!" It was the last time the two of them spoke.

As Newsweek previously reported, Pentagon Chief of Staff Kash Patel, rather than Cohen-Watnick (who was traveling with acting Secretary of Defense Miller in Asia and not the Middle East) was mysteriously called back to Washington. According to Carol Leonnig and Phillip Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It," Joint Chiefs Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley thought another national security official was about to be dismissed—maybe himself. Watnick-Cohen or Patel; Asia or the Middle East; another firing or a declaration of martial law: it is now clear that Flynn's machinations were taken seriously in the Pentagon, so much so that Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller held back on the use of the military on January 6.

According to the Department of Defense Inspector General's report on the Pentagon reaction to the elections and protests, Mr. Miller told us, "There was absolutely no way ... I was putting U.S. military forces at the Capitol, period." He cited media stories alleging that the President's advisors were pushing him to declare martial law to invalidate the election and that Mr. Miller was an ally installed as the Acting SecDef [Secretary of Defense] to facilitate a coup. He also cited a January 3, 2021 open letter from 10 former Secretaries of Defense warning the DoD not to use the military in a manner antithetical to the U.S. Constitution. Mr. Miller stated that he "made a very deliberate decision that I would not put U.S. military people ... East of the 9th Street, northwest. ... And the reason for that was I knew if the morning of the 6th or prior if we put U.S. military personnel on the Capitol, I would have created the greatest Constitutional crisis probably since the Civil War."

In the Inspector General's report, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy supports Miller's account, saying that Miller "made it clear that the military would not be involved in certifying the election results and that '10 different news agencies' asked him about military use and martial law." Some critics have suggested that Flynn be arrested for sedition or even treason, that all of the plotters and even January 6 protestors who attacked police and forcibly entered the Capitol be charged with the same. What is clear is that Flynn, in his public statements, never called for martial law. He repeated others' calls and said he wasn't calling for it himself. What he said to President Trump, and what he actually said to Watnick-Cohen or Kash Patel, is still a mystery.

The law is clear: "Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States ..." or anyone who might "teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence" is guilty of sedition.But sedition cases are rare in modern America, the proof of "overthrowing or destroying the government" by force of violence a high bar. Only 12 Americans have ever been successfully convicted in more than 200 years—rarities like Aaron Burr and Jefferson Davis. So many unsuccessful government attempts to apply the seditious label have made most prosecutors gun-shy about bringing charges. Most cases have been dismissed in court because judges have ruled that encouragement and incitement, no matter how radical, is protected by the First Amendment and doesn't prove that the accused had plans for a rebellion. The last person charged with sedition, the al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn, came in 2010. Before Gadahn could be tried in a court of law, he was killed by an Obama administration drone strike in Pakistan.

# Donald Trump's Lafayette Park Photo-Op Spooked Military Leaders [31]

On December 3, President Donald Trump authorized an extension, through March 31, 2021, for the use of the National Guard for COVID assistance. The decision mostly related to cost sharing. In 44 states, American territories, and the District of Columbia, the federal government would pay 75 percent of the cost, while in Florida and Texas the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent until the end of the year.

The COVID mobilization planted the seed of the view that military force—and specifically the National Guard—was essential for America in crisis, driving a frenzy of later questions around why they didn't save the day on January 6. The Pentagon's apparent paralysis does relate to the COVID mobilization, and also to the role the National Guard played, or was perceived to play, during the June 2020 George Floyd protests. Just as cost-sharing is the nitty-gritty of understanding the COVID response, the status of the National Guard and the rules for its use are key to understanding January 6. So who are the National Guard? And how do they differ from the active duty military, or even from the reserves? First, the Guard is the successor to the "militia of the several states" as written down in the Constitution over 200 years ago, which also outlines states' rights to create militias. As the militia, they belong to the governors, who each serve as the commander-in-chief of their state militia, the modern day National Guards. Guardsmen and women can be deputized to enforce the law, a role that generally is forbidden by the Posse Comitatus Act. (The law restricts the president's use of National Guard forces to enforce federal laws, unless it is to suppress an insurrection.)

The Guard is also a reserve component of the armed forces, different from the Army Reserve, that is a federal component of the Army. It wasn't until the modern era that this force began to be required to conform with federal guidelines in practice and equipment, to make them capable of being mobilized for active duty. When ordered to federal-level active duty (when the president "federalizes" them), the Pentagon pays for the Guard. When under the command and control of the governor, they can be paid for by federal funds (as in the case of the COVID mobilization), but not always. Then they are paid for by the state.

Because of discrimination against the citizens of the District of Columbia (in that it is neither a state nor a territory or commonwealth), the DC National Guard (DCNG) is under the control of the president. The Mayor of the District is not in the chain of command. In 1969, President Richard Nixon delegated most responsibilities for supervision and control of the DCNG to the Secretary of Defense, responsibility of Army national guardsmen and women further delegated to the Secretary of the Army. After the death of George Floyd in May 2020, National Guard personnel in 23 states and the District of Columbia were activated to help deal with protests across the United States. In June, as civil unrest increased in the nation's capital, about 800 guard members from the DCNG and from five adjoining states were called to active duty.

The presence of the Guard downtown, particularly around Lafayette Park across from the White House on June 1, met with widespread criticism. Federal law enforcement officers employed riot control agents and smoke bombs to disperse the protestors as Donald Trump left the White House and walked to St. John's Church for a photo op with the Bible. Trump was accompanied by a gaggle of aides and cabinet members, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Mark Milley, who later apologized for taking part in the event because it created a perception of military involvement in domestic politics.

Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy justified the use of the DCNG. "It turned very violent," he told the Pentagon Inspector General. "They looted buildings. They spray painted monuments. They burned a church. Six of our [DCNG] soldiers were injured and over the course of those 3 or 4 days about 100 policemen were injured." McCarthy responded to each of the main points of public criticism: that a low-flying an Army helicopter was conducting reconnaissance and buzzed the crowd, that federal officers identities were obscured, and that active duty soldiers were mixed in with the responders. The helicopter, he said, was a medical evacuation asset, doing its job. Though DCNG soldiers were present in the park, he said, they were confused with federal law enforcement because the guard lent them military police shields. And as for claims that active duty soldiers were present in violation of the law, based on their uniforms showing the patches of regular army units, this was caused by a lack of understanding. Many Guard soldiers, the Army explained, wore active duty patches of the units they served with on their right shoulder. On their left shoulders were their Guard unit patches. In addition, the Army said, some might have thought that some federal law enforcement officers who wore military-style uniforms were soldiers. But they were not—even if those personnel from other agencies wore no identifying clothing or patches.

The events of the summer disturbed the Pentagon leadership, particularly General Milley. Congress held hearings on the incident at Lafayette Park and the question of the role of the military, passing legislation setting new rules for the Defense Department and requiring all personnel to be identified when operating in American cities. At the Pentagon, procedures were put in place to ensure that soldiers—or any Guard formation—would not be used in case of civil disturbance unless the responsible federal civilian agency, mostly the FBI or Secret Service, made a formal request.

The hyper-sensitive military leadership thought, according to the Inspector General report, that "civilian authorities had become over-reliant" on the military as first responders rather than as a last resort. All of this played a factor on January 6, but of course the biggest factor was that intelligence analysts never anticipated the crowd or the violence.


#Donald Trump's Post-Election Fury Prompted a Warning from His General [32]

Joint Chiefs Chairman Army General Mark Milley spent December 4 at the White House, attending meetings with the national security team and principals—all the while, thinking he'd be fired. The chain of command, and the entire national security leadership had been disrupted. Secretary of Defense Mike Esper had been fired by Donald Trump, and a line of national security officials followed, terminated or forced to resign: Pentagon chief of staff, undersecretaries for policy and intelligence, chief of the nuclear weapons program, head of the cybersecurity agency, a gaggle of deputies and assistant secretaries at defense and homeland security. CIA director Gina Haspel and FBI director Christopher Wray were waiting to be axed as well. And there was the beginning of public rumbling that "the military" would do something if Donald Trump refused to leave office, which left Milley to hold the line.

Two days earlier the general had given an un-rosy assessment about the state of the U.S. armed forces, as gloomy a view as any president's primary military advisor could publicly speak. In a virtual event to the liberal Brookings Institution in Washington, Milley circumnavigated the globe in talking about the hazardous state of the world, concentrating as well on the progression of technology, and the changes that had happened in the information society since he joined the military in 1980. As expected—virtually required, in fact—Milley said no one should underestimate the might and determination of the U.S. military. "The United States military is a very powerful military," he said. "No one should ever mistake it for anything other than that: adversaries, friends, foes. The United States military is extraordinarily capable. We are very, very powerful." While the United States military had been involved in what he called "counterinsurgency warfare" for almost two decades—the perpetual war on terror in the Middle East—China and Russia had modernized their conventional forces, closing the gap. China, the general said, was now as big a military adversary, or bigger, than Russia.

At the same time, Milley said, the U.S. was moving towards a "relatively small footprint" overseas, one with greater risk. "We need to adjust our global footprint," he said. U.S. deployments in the Middle East and even Europe were being reconsidered and were shifting towards a few major bases supporting smaller satellite bases. With only 2,500 troops in Afghanistan (President Donald Trump's directive) the United States would be able to continue "our train, advise, assist mission and continue our counterterrorist mission." When pressed about this mission in Afghanistan, and the overall success of U.S. operations over 20 years, Milley said: "We went to Afghanistan ... to ensure that Afghanistan never again became a platform for terrorists to strike the United States. We believe that now after 20 years—two decades of consistent effort there—we've achieved a modicum of success.

A modicum of success. As long as we are supporting the government. China and Russia closing the gap. Nothing in Milley's speech approached the usual bravado about America being number one, nor did it promise that there was a path to get there. Milley didn't lay out some numerical comparison of the military balance. Everything in the future depended on advanced technologies—space, artificial intelligence, robotics—and a healthy United States, he said.

It wasn't a fundraising speech per se. To prepare the military to meet the future while continuing the war on terror would require about three to five percent real growth year, he said. "But that's also not necessarily going to happen, and I don't anticipate that it will happen," he said, predicting that defense spending was going to decline or at best start flattening out in the future. And on the question of strengthening the armed forces, he gave a particularly unmilitary answer. To be a great power, he said, certainly requires a strong and capable military. But it also requires a strong and capable economy, and a strong country internally, he said. "You have to have a very resilient country as a whole; you have to have a great education system; you've got to have great infrastructure. You have to look at it as a whole, of which the military is one piece of the whole."

"Your military is dependent upon a national economy," Milley said. "And we have had a significant pandemic, we've had a downturn, and an economic situation nationally for almost going on a year now. We've got significant unemployment, and so on. So the most important priority that you need is to take care of the COVID piece, get that behind us, and breathe new life into the economy." At the beginning of his talk, in addressing the strength of the military and the future, Milley also pledged: "We are determined to defend the U.S. Constitution and to protect the American people and their way of life. No one should doubt that."

"Part of the job I'm in right now as the chairman is to communicate with our adversaries in very close hold, classified back channels," Milley said, "but I do that, and so do a few other members of our government in order for our opponents to clearly and unambiguously know that if action A were to be then reaction B would happen as a result."

Was it a message for Donald Trump's ears?

James Webb, former Secretary of the Navy and Senator from Virginia, and accomplished novelist wrote in Responsible Statecraft: "General Milley appears to have spoken as much truth to power as one on active duty can, short of resigning in protest. While acknowledging the accomplishment of our primary mission in 2001—eliminating al-Qaeda in Afghanistan—and then tactfully laying out the reality on the ground, he provided policy-makers and Congress the information and space to bring the conflict to an honorable and expedient close."

There's no question that Milley had changed, both in his own post-9/11 framework of the future, and in pondering the role of the military in domestic affairs. He had already apologized for being in Lafayette Park in June 2020, and had spoken with Chinese General Li Zoucheng, his counterpart in Beijing, on October 30, 2020 and January 8, 2021, the first time to communicate reassurances that President Trump—"the United States"—was not planning any "October surprise" to provoke a crisis with China to win the election. The second follow-up was coincidental to January 6: planning for it had begun in early December.

Milley's calls were more routine military-to-military engagements with his counterpart, coordinated with the State Department and both Secretaries of Defense, Mark Esper and Chris Miller, and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows was briefed soon after. "I believe that I was faithfully executing the intent of the president, the United States at the time, because I knew with certainty that President Trump was not going to attack the Chinese just out of the blue," Milley later told a Congressional committee. By Milley's own admission though, they were never coordinated with Trump.

In Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's "Peril," which first brought attention to the calls, the calls are labeled urgent. "I want to assure you that the American government is stable and everything is going to be okay," Milley told his Chinese counterpart, according to the book. "We are not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you." "If we're going to attack," Milley went on, "I'm going to call you ahead of time. It's not going to be a surprise." Woodward and Costa write that on January 8, Milley called to reassure his Chinese counterpart about January 6. If true, a routine call turned into a private message. "We are 100 percent steady. Everything's fine. But democracy can be sloppy sometimes," Milley is reported as saying. Trump, speaking to the Newsmax television network after Woodward and Costa's book was published in September 2021, labeled Milley's actions "treason." For Milley to say Trump "was going to attack China is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and everybody knows it. That is a treasonous statement." "The way I look at Milley," Donald Trump later said in a statement, "he's just a better politician than a general, trying to curry favor with the Radical Left and the absolute crazy people espousing a philosophy which will destroy our Country!"

# Donald Trump Peddled His 'Stolen Election' Story. The Job was to Promote GOP Candidates [33]
On Saturday, December 5, Donald Trump flew to Valdosta, Georgia, to speak at a rally to support two Republican party candidates for the Senate, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. It was his first rally since the election, a month earlier. The point of Trump's trip to Georgia was to encourage voting in the January 5 runoff, a race that would decide the balance of power in Washington. Republicans needed only one victory in Georgia to maintain their majority. Democrats need a Georgia sweep to create a Senate divided down the center, making Vice President-elect Kamala Harris president of the Senate and the tiebreaking vote.

Thousands of Georgians came out, largely unmasked, to the rally site at Valdosta airport—not for the candidates, but for their president, the fighter, their fighter. Chants of "fight for Trump" drowned out the senate candidates when they briefly spoke. The rally was a success for Trump, strengthening his connection to his personal base. For the Republican party, it was a disaster.
After perfunctory introductions of Loeffler and Perdue, Trump pivoted back his favorite subject, his fictitious narrative of a stolen election. "You know we won Georgia, just so you understand," the president said, "and we won Florida and we won a lot of places. ... remember we were going to lose Florida ... I think they say that if you win Florida and if you win Ohio, in history you've never lost an election this has got to be a first time, but the truth is they were right we've never lost an election. We're winning this election."

In his two-hour speech, Trump called the state of Georgia corrupt and said that votes were coming out of the ceiling and out of leather bags. He urged everyone to vote, cautioning that they needed to make sure that no one threw out any ballots, that the Georgia secretary of state didn't know "what the hell he's doing." And at every point, the crowd interrupted with shouts of "stop the steal."

"Very simply you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether they will grow up in a free country and I will tell you, this socialist is just the beginning for these people, these people want to go further than socialism they want to go into a communistic form of government and I have no doubt about it," Trump said.

Calling the Democratic Party candidates two of the most "extreme far left candidates in the history of our country," Trump urged people to vote, while also saying that "they could cheat in Georgia" and "they're going to try and rig this election too." He went on and on, about all the good he'd done, about everyone else being a fraud or a danger, about saving America, about protecting their right to free speech, about saving their guns, about stopping the "radical indoctrination" of their children. "We can't let them do it again ... steal Georgia. Your governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing," he said.

Hours before his appearance in Valdosta, the president called Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, asking him to convene the state legislature, appoint pro-Trump electors and overturn the results. Governor Kemp refused, according to the AP's account. Kemp tweeted that Trump asked him to order an audit of signatures on absentee ballots—a move, he said, that he was not empowered to take because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process. Trump responded on Twitter: "Your people are refusing to do what you ask. What are they hiding? ...""As I told the President this morning," Kemp tweeted, "I've publicly called for a signature audit three times (11/20, 11/24, 12/3) to restore confidence in our election process and to ensure that only legal votes are counted in Georgia." An audit had been initiated by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the race had already been certified; Biden had won.

At this point, many mainstream Republicans in Washington were concerned that Trump's harping on fraudulent elections would actually discourage people from going to the polls. The margin for Biden in Georgia was only 12,500 votes of five million cast, so even a small shift could have an outsize effect. Vice President Mike Pence was worried enough to address the issue. Campaigning with Perdue in Savannah, he said: "I know we've all got our doubts about the last election, and I hear some of you saying, 'Just don't vote' ... If you don't vote, they win." The Republicans would go on to lose both races in historically deeply red Georgia. Back in Washington on December 5, Attorney General William Barr wrote out his resignation letter.

# 'Your Days are F--king Numbered': Threats Rained Down on Election Officials [34]

Michigan's Senate and House offices were closed December 6 in response to "credible threats of violence," Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said in a statement that Sunday night. Armed protestors had gathered that weekend outside the Detroit home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. "As my four-year-old son and I were finishing up decorating the house for Christmas on Saturday night, and he was about to sit down to watch 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' dozens of armed individuals stood outside my home shouting obscenities and chanting into bullhorns in the dark of night," the top election official for the state said.

According to Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, protestors at Benson's house could be heard shouting "You're murderers" within earshot of Benson's son's bedroom. Nessel, in a tweet, accused the pro-Trump demonstrators of "mob-like behavior [that] is an affront to basic morality and decency." Benson said: "There is a line crossed when gatherings are done with the primary purpose of intimidation of public officials who are carrying out the oath of office they solemnly took as elected officials.

"The demands made outside my home were unambiguous, loud and threatening," she said. "They targeted me in my role as Michigan's Chief Election Officer. But the threats of those gathered weren't actually aimed at me—or any other elected officials in this state. They were aimed at the voters."

A spokesman for Benson put out the department's own statement, saying that "the voters have spoken and their will has carried the day." "Let's be clear—Secretary Benson just oversaw the largest and most secure election in our state's history," the statement said. "Secretary Benson will continue to use every tool at her disposal to protect the votes and voices of the 5.5 million Michigan citizens who cast ballots in this election, and she would have done so no matter the president they had selected." Michigan State Rep. Cynthia Johnson then shared several threatening voicemails she'd received, including some that said she would be lynched, the Detroit Free Press reported. Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, a Republican, released a statement saying he and his family had been targeted too.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tweeted, "Threats against our elected officials, no matter their party, are dangerous and unacceptable. This must stop." But the targeting of government officials—a trend that had started as COVID protests—swept across the country. During the first week of December, the Washington Post reported, an "enemies" list of state and federal officials "floated up from the dark corners of the Web, with home addresses listed and red targets over their photos, the latest in a string of threats to public officials."

In Cobb County, Georgia, protestors gathered in election offices, threatening workers and telling them that they were going to prison. In Fulton County, Georgia, Elections Director Richard Barron received a voicemail saying he "better run" and that he would be tarred and feathered and executed unless "ya'll do something" about voter fraud. In Arizona, electors met in an undisclosed location. There, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, also responsible for administering the election, was harassed, a caller leaving a message saying she'd hang "from a fucking tree." "They're going to hang you for treason, you fucking bitch."

In Idaho, Ada County Commissioner Diana Lachiondo said tearfully before a Zoom district health board meeting: "My 12-year-old son is home by himself right now, and there are protesters banging outside the door. I'm going to go home and make sure he's OK."

In Illinois, a man sent threatening letters to the U.S. Attorney and a federal judge. "im [sic] going to make sure you never see Christmas ... I might have someone walk in the Court House and blow all you evil [expletive] to pieces."

In Montpelier, Vermont, a protestor told workers at the Secretary of State's office that they were about to die. "This might be a good time to put a fucking pistol in your fucking mouth and pull the trigger," the man shouted. "Your days are fucking numbered." The New York Times reported that officials in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Nevada had been threatened. Amber McReynolds, director of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit organization, received a threat over Twitter, a picture of a noose and a caption that read, "You're a traitor to the American people." There were threats against elected officials in at least 11 states. In all cases, the FBI wouldn't confirm or deny the existence of a specific investigation. In a statement, the Bureau told Reuters that it takes such acts seriously, working with other law enforcement agencies "to identify and stop any potential threats to public safety."

Back in Michigan, Secretary of State Benson released a formal statement. "I began my career investigating violent neo-Nazi and white supremacist organizations throughout the country," it said. "A photo of Detroiter Viola Liuzzo, along with a replica of her Michigan license plate from the vehicle she was driving when she was murdered, hangs in my office. I am acutely aware of the risks borne throughout history of those working to stand guard over and protect our democratic process. Nothing about the incessant and graphic threats made outside my home, or those that flood my social media accounts, will deter me, my team, or the more than 1,600 election administrators across the state of Michigan from doing our jobs."

# 'Racist.' 'Terrorist.' 'Extremist.' Did the FBI Get the Proud Boys Wrong? [35]

Shawn Price of Rockaway, New Jersey, age 26, bragged on Facebook that he'd helped start the state's chapter of the Proud Boys. "North Jersey is my area," he posted on December 7, telling followers to meet him in Washington D.C. He vetted a fellow New Jersey resident who claimed to have started another chapter in the state. "So you got permission from Enrique to start your own chapter?" he asked. Enrique is Henry "Enrique" Tarrio, the chairman of the Proud Boys since 2018, a Cuban-American born in Miami, Florida. Once state director of Latinos for Trump and a Republican candidate for Congress, he attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, the year he became involved with the Proud Boys. Tarrio was arrested on January 5 by the Metropolitan Police Department in DC. "No bitch. This is war," Proud Boys leader Ethan Nordean, posted on social media in response to a call for unity in embracing the results of the presidential election.

Joe Biggs, another Proud Boys member, posted on social media a few days after the election: "It's time for a fucking war if they steal this shit." Biggs says on the Proud Boys live-streamed show "War Boys" that government officials were "evil scum, and they all deserve a traitor's death." "Day of the rope," Nordean responded to Biggs. "When police officers or government officials are breaking the law, what are we supposed to do as the people? Discourse? What are we supposed to debate? No, you have to use force." (After the Capitol Riot, Shawn Price allegedly messaged his mother, "I led the storm!" He, Nordean and Biggs have been indicted by the Justice Department.)

The Proud Boys attracted significant media attention but were also probably the most inscrutable of all the groups that gathered at the Capitol: no one, including the FBI and Homeland Security, seemed to actually understand them. Founded in the last year of the Obama administration, they are an anti-left, anti-big government organization: pro the continuation of "traditional" America and anti-anything that suggests a dissolution of western dominance.

"The left, the mainstream news media, the Democratic Party, the 'swamp', the United Nations, they're all working to destroy America," says Steve, a Carlsbad, California, member of the Proud Boys. "I don't mean some white supremacy shit and I'm not even a gun owner. I mean like just protecting what we have from Antifa and Black Lives Matter and the bleeding hearts, stopping the running down of everything, removal of our history with the statues and all, screwing with the elections."

Steve, who asked that his last name not be used, attended the rally in Washington on November 14 but couldn't afford to go to a second rally in December. He felt compelled to go on January 6, he told Newsweek, because he believed that the election was indeed rigged, and he planned to march on the Capitol. He says he was on the west Capitol steps during the afternoon, part of the crowd pushing forward. But, he says, he never entered the building nor did he confront any police directly. He thought that they could indeed disrupt the electoral certification because he thought that the declaration was premature. But mostly, he says, he wanted to lend his voice to the opposition.

"The FBI interviewed me," he says, "and were interested in the video I took." But other than that, he says, no action has been taken, and none of the twenty or so southern Californians he traveled with or met have been indicted or arrested. "You know, I like the Proud Boys, the fellowship, and I'm proud to say I marched. But the questions the FBI asked me, like the PB is some terrorist group, they were just dumb. I think I read somewhere that about 200 PB members were there on the 6th. But to say we were trying to overthrow the country or provoke a civil war—200 guys—that's ridiculous." Steve thinks the conventional label—far right, extremist, racist, even fascist "like all over Wikipedia"—is off-base. "Is Black Lives Matter racist? Are they under a microscope like we are? Where are the mass arrests from their rampage in 2020? All of that just makes me more suspicious of the powers that be."

The Southern Poverty Law Center designates the Proud Boys a hate group; the Anti-Defamation League says it is violent, nationalistic, Islamophobic, transphobic and misogynist. Starting in 2018, Facebook started banning Proud Boys pages. But it is actually an odd combination of inclusiveness and right-wing action: its chairman is a Latino and the group has many African-American members. A January 2021 Secret Service Protective Intelligence Brief issued just before January 6 described the organization as "a right-wing group founded in 2016 ... as a 'pro-Western fraternal organization.'" That's how it was described upon its founding, as a "fraternal organization" for young "Western chauvinist" men. The FBI, according to a domestic intelligence analyst, says that there are about 24,000 members in more than 80 chapters, including overseas membership. He requested anonymity in order to discuss classified matters. "Proud Boys leadership," the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) says, "has carefully crafted a public image of an inclusive club for men of all races, backgrounds and sexual orientations who subscribe to one mantra: The West (i.e. 'Western' culture) is best, and anyone who 'opposes' it ('leftists' of all stripes and feminists, among others) is the enemy." Enrique Tarrio pushes an anti-racism slant. When Proud Boys announced that they would be marching in Charlottesville, the organization officially denounced the event and warned members that they would be banned from the group if they marched.

The Secret Service says that 2017 is the year when "demonstration activity" by the Proud Boys started entering their radar. The most prominent incident occurred in October 2018, when two members of the Proud Boys were convicted of disorderly conduct after assaulting masked protestors during a fight that broke out in New York City when Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the creation of a new unit within the New York Police Department's intelligence bureau, dedicated to investigating terror threats from "far-right" and neo-Nazi organizations, including Proud Boys.

After the New York clash, the Philadelphia Division of the FBI reported that "unidentified ANTIFA adherents" were organizing individuals—Stand Against the Proud Boys—from across the country to "execute violence against" Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ("Potential for Violence Near Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 17 November 2018") In a February 20, 2020, report ("Assembly of Improvised Explosive Device by Racially Motivated Violent Extremist Group 'Phalanx'"), the FBI Denver Division stated that a confidential human source said members of an organization called the Phalanx had created an improvised explosive device during an event where they were overrun by Antifa. The device was made out of a drinking glass, approximately two dozen two-inch-long nails, and an M-80 firecracker duct taped to the drinking glass. "Phalanx members are known to participate in formation and riot drills at a local park in an effort to be better organized at protests and expressed having black clad individuals with shields protecting those members who were more vocal," the FBI report said. "Phalanx membership consisted of individuals associated with the following groups: Black Shirts for Social Credit, American Identity Movement, Proud Boys, Patriot Front, Denver Anonymous, The Fourteeners, Goyim Defense League, and Blood and Honour Colorado. In addition to conducting riot drills at a local Denver park, members of the Phalanx were known to frequent a local Denver bar with the hopes of taking it over for meetings and recruit additional members."

On April 19, 2020, the leader of a Florida Proud Boys chapter posted a flyer with upcoming protests to reopen Florida's economy. He referenced a conspiracy theory that Democrats created the quarantine to destabilize the economy in an effort to remove President Trump from office. All through 2020, the Proud Boys were active, according to a report of the Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC), in "spreading conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 .. Their overall messaging has called the stay-at-home orders ineffective and unconstitutional, and suggests a faction of elites are weaponizing the virus, and a vaccine would likely be a tool for population control and mind control." (CIAC is the federal government-financed statewide fusion center that works closely with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.)

The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness reported in their "2020 Terrorism Threat Assessment" that on June 29, 2020, "anarchist extremists and Proud Boys members clashed at a rally in Portland, Oregon, forcing law enforcement to declare a civil disturbance and use riot control methods to disperse the crowds. Additionally, anarchist extremists assaulted a journalist videotaping the event, resulting in a head injury."

During a campaign debate on September 29, Donald Trump told the Proud Boys to "stand back and stand by." On September 30, Trump clarified his statement, stating that he "doesn't know what the Proud Boys are" and that "they should stand down. Let law enforcement do their work." On October 1, Trump said on Sean Hannity's FOX show: "I've said it many times, and let me be clear again: I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don't know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing. But I condemn that." Trump's implication that the Proud Boys were a white supremacist organization did indeed show that he didn't know much about them. Asked about the social media statements promoting violence and war in America, Steve, the Proud Boys member, was unapologetic. "Sure, there are some who want violence," he told Newsweek, but he didn't see, beyond the local chapters, how anyone could think the organization is consequential or organized enough to provoke civil war. "I hate to sound like a 'there's no one here but us chickens' kind of guy, but there were 120,000 people at the Capitol." He was not far off. While there were a dozen or so individual Proud Boys investigations open in the FBI prior to January 6, the domestic intelligence analyst says there were none at the national level. Of the 1.1 million homeland security threat reports circulated in the years before January 6, just 32 mentioned the Proud Boys.

# Ted Cruz Offered His Services in Resolving National 'Acrimony' About the Election [36]

On December 8, a week before the electoral college was scheduled to meet, one of Donald Trump's last avenues of appeal was shut off, as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a claim challenging Pennsylvania's voting by mail. In a complaint fronted by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), the plaintiffs asserted that the electoral system raised federal issues because the federal Constitution was violated if the Pennsylvania legislature expanded the mail-in procedure without proper authority from the state constitution. "Now, let's see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it's a legislator or legislatures, or whether it's a justice of the Supreme Court, or a number of justices of the Supreme Court—let's see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right," the president said before the ruling. "The application for injunctive relief presented to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied," the one-sentence Supreme Court order said.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz said that if the Supreme Court took up the Pennsylvania lawsuit, he was ready to present the oral argument. "The bitter division and acrimony we see across the nation needs resolution," Cruz told Fox News. "I believe the Supreme Court has a responsibility to the American people to ensure, within its powers, that we are following the law and following the Constitution." Cruz, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is a former Solicitor General for the State of Texas. Up until December 8, Donald Trump's campaign team and his various allies had lost more than 50 election-related lawsuits.

On Tuesday too, Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a complaint that asked the Supreme Court to overturn the vote in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia on the grounds that their flawed elections had violated the rights of Texans. "Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification, government officials in the defendant states of Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania usurped their legislatures' authority and unconstitutionally revised their state's election statutes," the complaint stated. "They accomplished these statutory revisions through executive fiat or friendly lawsuits, thereby weakening ballot integrity. Finally, these same government officials flooded the ... states with millions of ballots."

The complaint asked the Supreme Court to extend the deadline for the electoral college's meeting, set by law for December 14. A letter signed by 126 members of Congress supported the filing. President Trump called it "the Big One." He again tweeted: "... It is much easier for the Supreme Court of the United States to follow the Constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done. They must show great Courage & Wisdom. Save the USA!!!" In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Georgia, the Attorneys General issued statements denouncing the Texas filing, the Democrats calling the filing an attempt to "mislead the public and tear at the fabric of our Constitution." The Republican Attorney General for Georgia called the filing "constitutionally, legally and factually wrong."

Three days later, the Supreme Court again perfunctorily dismissed the Texas lawsuit. One state could not object to how another state conducted its elections. The unsigned order said. "The State of Texas's motion for leave to fill a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution."

President Trump tweeted: "It is a legal disgrace, an embarrassment to the USA!!!" Trump had personally appointed three of the nine members of the Court and now he was mad that none of them paid him back. Trump was particularly angry, Bob Woodward and Robert Costa wrote in "Peril," that his advisors had stopped him from appointing Rudy Giuliani to the bench. The news media and the Democrats could not have been more vicious in their mockery of "the legal stupidity" associated with the suit, Woodward and Costa wrote. But maybe Trump's own representatives didn't actually believe the legal argument and were operating only out of self-interest. "It was necessary and productive to support Trump's asinine and hopeless suit because Trump had mustered so much support among so many voters with no interest in or capacity for empirical reasoning, or, at least, who were preoccupied with other issues."

Whatever their motivation, more than 100 members of Congress and numerous state officials supported Donald Trump's crusade. Election denial was spreading, even if the transition itself was limping forward. On December 8, Republicans voted to reject a motion offered by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD) that the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies move forward with the assumption that the January 20 inauguration was for President-elect Joe Biden. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) blocked the motion, forcing the Committee to prepare for a generic event. "Their continued deference to President Trump's post-election temper tantrums threatens our democracy and undermines faith in our system of elections," Hoyer said. "Republicans are refusing even to allow [the committee] to say that President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will be inaugurated on January 20, even when there is no serious dispute over that fact." It would now fall to the people to influence Congress, stop the steal, and save America. That's what Trump and a growing mass of his supporters were starting to think.


# Donald Trump Supporters, Censored, Discovered They Didn't Need Twitter, YouTube [37]

On December 9, YouTube announced that it would begin removing new content posted to its platform that "misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election." YouTube said that while users were allowed to post whatever they wanted about an undecided election, content claiming fraud or errors intended to influence public opinion regarding a past election would not be allowed. It was a reversal of the companies' earlier stance not to remove election-related videos.

A quarter of U.S. adults get their news from YouTube, according to the Pew Research Center. The dominant video-posting site's action now went far beyond the two other social media giants—Facebook and Twitter—which had started labeling posts that it judged to be misinformation or disinformation but in general were not removing those kinds of posts. YouTube said its policy would apply only to new videos uploaded after December 9. The site said it was implementing the new policy because Tuesday marked what is known as the safe harbor deadline, where enough states had officially certified the election results to determine a president-elect.

Up until the YouTube announcement, public action to suppress free speech on social media had occurred mostly on Twitter. That site was banning accounts for false COVID narratives, as well as extremist postings. In 2018, Twitter first banned the right-wing bombast and conspiracy influencer Alex Jones for violating its policy on "inciting violence" and "abusive behavior." All of the Jones-related Infowars accounts were then permanently suspended. Facebook, Spotify and Apple removed Alex Jones-related podcasts and videos in 2018, and his channels were banned also on YouTube.

That same year, the account of Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, was banned for violating Twitter's policy on "violent extremist groups." So too was the @ProudBoysUSA account. McInnes was also banned on YouTube. In 2019, the account of Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, was banned from Twitter for using "language that dehumanizes others on the basis of religion." In May 2019, Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram announced a ban of "dangerous individuals and organizations" including Farrakhan, Alex Jones and his organization InfoWars, as well as other right-wing influencers.

During 2020, before the election, Twitter suspended over 50 white nationalist accounts, as well as 157,000 QAnon-related accounts and bots. YouTube also banned QAnon-linked news sites, for promoting "conspiracy theories that have been used to justify real-world violence." Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke's account was also banned on both Twitter and YouTube. After the November election, Trump advisor Steve Bannon's Twitter account was suspended.

The YouTube news on December 9 generally provoked commentary about the lack of consistency across the social media companies, as well as the flaws and loopholes in their various policies. By and large, the mainstream news media coverage did not question the censorship, or even use the word. The justification for the "deplatforming," as supporters called it on social media, is to reduce avenues for hate speech, disinformation and psychological warfare. The defenders argue that while the government is impeded by the First Amendment from limiting or criminalizing speech, private companies are under no obligation to allow content they deem offensive or indefensible.

But banning does not always have the effect that proponents seek. U.S. intelligence organizations that monitor social media and follow the cat-and-mouse games between cyber warriors and extremist groups note that new commercial platforms and better encryption constantly emerge to replace blocked avenues. For example, while Twitter and Facebook are generally utilized by extremists to communicate messages and recruit adherents, new avenues became dominant in 2020 as censorship increased. Domestically, this meant Parler, Telegram, Reddit and the.donald.win became the main sites for election-related dissemination and organizing. All during the lead-up to January 6, the FBI, NSA and Department of Homeland Security were struggling to monitor accounts that had to do with overt law-breaking, according to homeland security reporting, including encrypted Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp channels (WhatsApp is owned by Facebook).

Telegram in particular had been the favored social media platform for ISIS from its founding, specifically the English and Arabic language Invasion Brigade Telegram channels. Telegram is a messaging app enabling users to send messages, photos, videos and files. In the early days of ISIS, Telegram introduced a new tool called "Channels" which allowed users to broadcast their messages to an unlimited number of followers. Within days of the announcement, ISIS launched an official Arabic-language Telegram Channel for propaganda distribution. In the weeks following the launch of their Arabic channel, ISIS announced official Telegram channels in English, French, German, Indonesian, Bosnian, Bengali, Turkish, Kurdish, Urdu, Swedish and Russian.

Telegram did move to block 78 ISIS-related channels across 12 languages and created easier ways for users to report objectionable content. But the company also said it was not intercepting private channels. In May 2018, the pro-ISIS Constantinople Foundation urged users to migrate from speaking only among themselves on Telegram to a more skillful use of Twitter, so that ISIS proselytizers and recruiter not "remain locked in the prison called Telegram," according to an intelligence report.

"In response to the continued suspensions of their accounts, ISIS supporters have started to create networks of low-profile accounts on Twitter that sometimes look like a network of social bots, in hopes of keeping their accounts active longer," the report said. "These low-profile accounts typically have no background photo, a generic profile photo, and regular names (ex. Judy Hughes, Linda Porter, etc.), that upon first glance would not suggest affiliation with ISIS."

Other extremist organizations, particularly neo-Nazi, white supremacist and ultra-nationalist groups, both in Europe and North America, also gravitated towards Telegram, as did domestic groups, particularly those banned or restricted on the mainstream public sites. And yet a January 2020 FBI report stated that cyber actors on the Darknet were moving more and more to encrypted communications platforms to evade law enforcement. The report mentioned Telegram, Wickr, ProtonMail, Jabber, Tutanota, ICQ and Kik.

The irony, a domestic threat report stated, was that "increased public awareness of government surveillance has contributed to the rising consumer demand for covert messaging apps." The report referred to WhatsApp, Kik, Wickr, TextSecure, surespot, SCRAMBL3, THREEMA, and SILENT CIRCLE. "Messages do not register on the user's phone plan and are not discoverable by legal demand served on the mobile phone carrier (for example, search warrants or court orders) ..." the report said.

Militia extremists in the United States, it went on to say, are telling members "to use secure messaging services like Wickr to discuss surveillance and group membership." The widely held view—that mainstream censorship was effective in suppressing hate speech and false narratives—was wrong. People and organizations were just moving to other platforms which were less familiar to most in the news media and did not, before January 6, become a source for news-gathering.

After the election, YouTube also announced that it was temporarily barring One America News Network from posting new videos: the site had violated YouTube's rules against misinformation by posting content claiming there is a guaranteed cure for COVID. Donald Trump called OAN a "great alternative" to Fox News, which had reported that the president lost Arizona and affirmed Joe Biden's victory. Viewership surged in November 2020; 767,000 people installed the app that month. Subsequent months were just as high. According to Reuters, the OAN website averages 8 million visits a month from desktop and mobile users, having peaked at 15 million from November 2020 through January 2021.

OAN says people can watch the channel without a TV cable plan and without a contract on the desktop or mobile. That meant alternative news like OAN no longer had to be sanctioned or judged by the mainstream to gain viewers and get their message out. Nor are extremists of any stripe constrained from organizing and communicating: those who refuse to comply with the rules of the mainstream don't have to be heard by the mainstream. Deplatforming, in other words, became another factor in widening the American divide.

# Exclusive: Far Right's Growing Anti-Government Rage Put Security Agencies on Alert [38]

Cancel Christmas? If COVID wasn't already a disruption to the world's way of life, on December 10, German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked her fellow citizens to sacrifice even more, to limit social contacts over the holidays as she called for a new nationwide lockdown. "It hurts me," she said. "It really aches in my heart. But if the price of these niceties is that our fatalities are now at 590 people a day, then this is not acceptable, and so we have to tighten this."

If people "spend too much time with others, now just before Christmas, it could end up being the last celebration with the grandparents," Merkel said. "Surely then we would have messed up. We shouldn't do that." Germany reported a record number of COVID infections, with over 1,000 deaths in the previous two days. The number of confirmed COVID cases had passed 65 million worldwide, with the global death toll exceeding 1.5 million. The World Health Organization said that over 10,000 people worldwide were dying on average every day, or one death every nine seconds. In the United States, a record 3,124 COVID deaths were reported on December 10, shattering every daily world record. A record number of American were hospitalized, and more than 220,000 new cases were reported in just 24 hours. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published projections that predicted that as many as 23,000 new COVID hospitalizations a day could follow the Christmas holiday weekend unless public health measures like social distancing and mask wearing were widely adopted. California ordered a new state-wide lockdown to combat the deaths.

"Our country is in the middle of a dramatic spike in COVID-19 cases," President-elect Joe Biden tweeted. "Please wear a mask, keep social distancing, and limit the size of any groups. It's our patriotic duty as Americans." But the definition of "patriotic duty" had become contentious as the divide between the American people became more and more pronounced. Classified threat reports seen exclusively by Newsweek reveal security officials' fears of growing COVID-fueled, anti-government rage on the far right. Very early during COVID, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a classified report that Telegram and other "far-right" social media channels were being used to oppose government mandates, particularly that thousands of refuseniks were increasingly disenchanted or suspicious of government policy.

"Conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19 have provided a platform for far-right users to encourage attacks on critical infrastructure," the threat report said. "Popular targets include the electrical grid near vulnerable quarantine areas, healthcare facilities, 5G cell towers, and government workers." Email addresses and passwords "allegedly belonging to healthcare workers were released online, and almost immediately used for hacking and harassment by far-right extremists," the report said. Explosive attacks were also reported on 5G cell towers; FEMA was under assault for supposedly operating prison camps for protestors and Patriots, and COVID protestors were encouraged to educate themselves on the power grid "to better sabotage it" in order to slow down the spread of the virus and impede government control.

"These incidents are only a few examples of the increasing threat from far-right individuals," the threat report said. "It is likely far-right online users will continue to exploit conspiracy theories to threaten critical infrastructure, and as was seen with the attempted attack on a healthcare facility in Missouri ..." Numerous classified cyber advisories followed, reminding state and local organizations to implement cyber hygiene protocols, "as malicious cyber actors are continuing to exploit the public's fears of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)." "Cybercriminals are using COVID-19 government relief themes to lure individuals into downloading financial malware," the DHS said.

In another threat report, the DHS said that: "Racially Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVE) and Domestic Violent Extremists (DVE) groups are seeking to exploit the coronavirus pandemic to further their extremist ideologies. Social media and encrypted messaging applications are a primary tool for RMVEs and DVEs to spread disinformation and hateful rhetoric against Jewish people, immigrants, minority groups, and LE [law enforcement], and to incite anxiety and fear."

ISIS endorsed attacks in countries impacted by COVID-19, the FBI reported. The organization was telling its adherents that the virus opened up new opportunities, particularly in the United States. "Should a mass casualty attack occur in a US location with high rates of COVID-19 cases, it would likely lead to more fatalities than if the attack occurred in the same locations before the pandemic due to limitations in first responder, intensive care unit (ICU), and operating room resources. Currently, perpetrators are likely to target hospitals or essential businesses due to stay-at-home or similar orders making mass gathering targets unavailable to attackers," another homeland security threat report said.

The California State Threat Assessment Center (STAC) said in a report: "DVEs, RMVEs, and others have called for acts of violence in retaliation against perceived government overreach related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may demonstrate a threat actor's willingness to target both LE and military personnel as representatives of COVID-19 response policies." "A number of recent suspicious incidents throughout California involved an array of potential malicious actors who may have sought to exploit the COVID-19 situation by misrepresenting themselves as LE or health officials, establishing 'unannounced health check-points,' or attempting to introduce false non-FDA-approved COVID-19 testing kits and other related 'cures' or 'treatments' into the US marketplace," STAC said.

"A broad category of DVEs, RMVEs, militia extremists, and others have called for intentionally spreading the virus or retaliating against perceived government overreach in response to the pandemic," the FBI, DHS, and the National Counterterrorism Center said in a joint report. "Violent extremists probably will continue to share largely aspirational guidance online to incite violence, intimidate targets, and promote their ideologies, and an attack could occur with little or no warning," said the DHS Counterterrorism Mission Center (CTMC) in another report. Another FBI Situational Information Report said that sick individuals were being asked to go to synagogues, Muslim temples, and public transport to spread the virus further. "Cough on your local minority" was the tag line on a meme that was circulating on Telegram, the FBI warned.

"Social media postings by violent extremist actors suggest individuals who have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus should target LE [law enforcement], minority communities, places of worship, and public transportation," a DHS Office of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Intelligence Note repeated.
Threats to critical infrastructure, harassment of health care workers, vulnerabilities in the supply chain, counterfeit masks and PPP, fraudulent claims, malicious cyber actors, coronavirus hate crimes against Asians, distributed denial of service attacks, threats to telework, vulnerabilities in Zoom; it was a Niagara of threat reports. "Incarcerated gang members granted early release due to COVID-19 concerns likely will engage in criminal activity in the area of their release," the FBI even warned in an Emerging Intelligence Report.

"Due to the highly personal nature of radicalization and mobilization to violence, it is difficult to determine definite indicators that are indicative of Homegrown Violent Extremists' intent to commit violence at home or abroad," the DHS said in a restricted report, "COVID-19 Medical Resource Burden Would Likely Increase US Mass Casualty Attack Fatalities, Renewing Focus on Protective Measures."

> "Some observed activities that may be suspicious may include constitutionally protected activity. No single indicator should be the sole basis for law enforcement action. Speech, actions, beliefs, appearances, or way of life does not, in and of itself, equate to a suspicious individual. These activities should not be reported absent articulable facts and circumstances that support the source agency's suspicion that the observed behavior is reasonably indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorism."

The DHS coverage throughout 2020 continued with emphasis on foreign threats. "HVEs are distinct from traditional domestic terrorists who engage in unlawful acts of violence to intimidate civilian populations or attempt to influence domestic policy without direction from or influence from a foreign actor," the report said. In other words, "ideologically-motivated terrorist activities (including providing material support to terrorism) in furtherance of political or social objectives promoted by a foreign terrorist organization," the department said.

As COVID reached new records in the first week of December, protests against COVID health restrictions also peaked. Some restaurateurs began to defy mandates to close outdoor dining. Parents rallied to keep playgrounds open. The underground filled with complaints and rumors that COVID itself was a conspiracy on the part of Democrats and others to create not just the conditions to defeat Donald Trump but also to take away guns and place Patriots in concentration camps. In the middle of it all, President-elect Joe Biden announced that one of his first acts as president would be to ask all Americans to commit to 100 days of wearing masks. "The next three to six weeks at minimum ... are our COVID weeks," Dr. Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board, said on CNN. He urged Americans to do their utmost to slow the contagion by limiting social interactions to members of their immediate households, and above all, "No Christmas parties."

# Donald Trump's Refusal to Concede Fueled the 'Emerging Domestic Threats' [39]

At 8:42 a.m. on December 11, the first-known intelligence of any sort relating to a potential problem on January 6 was exchanged within the U.S. government. John Donahue, head of U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) Intelligence and Inter-Agency Coordination Division wrote to a subordinate asking for a preliminary assessment of the scheduled Joint Session of Congress.

Donohue, who's considered an expert on right-wing extremism, anticipated a challenge to the electoral vote from a few members of Congress, according to a post-January 6 Congressional investigation. No rally had yet been publicly announced for that day, but Donahue thought the combination of Donald Trump's refusal to concede the election and his evident support by over 100 members of the House in overturning the results, together with planned protests, elevated the event's importance. Donahue's boss—Sean Gallagher, Deputy Chief of the Protective Services Bureau—then wrote to his boss Yogananda Pittman, Assistant Chief of Police for Protective and Intelligence Operations, and then to Pittman's boss, head of the Capitol Police Steven Sund, saying that the Joint Session "will bring some demonstrations, with the potential for some issues on the House floor." Sund responded that he was considering a "significant deployment." Donahue's division had already prepared an intelligence assessment for the November 14 protests in Washington saying that various extremist groups were expected to attend the events and that there was a likelihood of violence. And it had prepared another assessment for the upcoming "MAGA II" event in Washington that was scheduled for the following day (December 12), saying the same.

But whatever wariness had surfaced on December 11 seemed to go nowhere. The MAGA I and II events didn't prove very threatening. There were few arrests and only sporadic incidents of violence, no injuries to officers, and the Metropolitan Police Department seemed to handle things fine. If anything, the lesson drawn from both events was that the greatest threat was protestors and counter-protestors clashing—not a threat to the USCP or the Capitol Building itself.

"As we prepared for the third protest [January 6]," USCP chief Sund later said, "we understood that the focus of the protests would be the Capitol itself, and not the Supreme Court as in the previous two demonstrations, and that we could expect the crowd to be somewhat different in size and risk." The threat was still not understood. Subsequent intelligence assessments would be written, but none of them built upon the basic December 11 concern, the USCP rating the likelihood of violence at very low. Is the Capitol Police ultimately to blame? USCP is not a formal intelligence gathering organization, relying for most things on Executive Branch agencies for information. (USCP is part of the Legislative branch.) So while an intelligence division might sound grand, Donahue's division had all of 14 assigned analysts at the time, including the director. There was a Threat Assessment Section and an Intelligence Operations Section within the Protective Service Bureau. But in total, there were fewer than 70 people assigned to all three, and their main focus was the security of members of Congress, particularly in their travel and in their home states. This generated a considerable workload. One factor: from 2017 to 2020, according to USCP numbers, there had been a 118 percent increase in total threats, with the overwhelming majority of suspects residing outside of the Washington DC metropolitan area.

In reality, other than its own checking of social media and news reports, and other than the tips and threats phoned in or mailed to members, the overall USCP received any classified intelligence assessments from federal partners: the FBI, Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security. The Capitol Security Review report (March 5, 2021) stated: "Only a handful of people in the USCP have significant intelligence training. The understaffed Intelligence and Interagency Coordination Division (IICD) lacks the experience, knowledge, and processes to provide intelligence support against emerging domestic threats."

The Security Review, the U.S. Capitol Police Inspector General, and the joint report of the Senate Rules and Administration and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committees all came to the same conclusion about the USCP's "intelligence" entities, that they failed to properly analyze either the information in their possession or the protests that took place on November 14 and December 12. "USCP failed to disseminate relevant information obtained from outside sources, lacked consensus on the interpretation of threat analyses, and disseminated conflicting intelligence information regarding planned events for January 6, 2021," Inspector General Michael A. Bolton told the Senate Committees. It was all more of a surprise given their first detection that something might go awry.

After Donahue's December 11 message, the intelligence division engaged a commercial company to monitor social media to detect any threats to the Capitol. But befitting the focus of the USCP, the key words asked to be monitored were "Joint Session of Congress" and not anything about extremists. What happened to that social media monitoring effort, and what platforms were being monitored, remains a mystery.

# Donald Trump's Good Day: Cheered at West Point, Wowed by a Stop the Steal Protest [40]

On Saturday, December 12, Donald Trump supporters descended on Washington to protest the supposed stealing of the election. Though the main venue was supposed to be the Supreme Court, the protesters split between Freedom Plaza, the National Mall, the Capitol and the Court, with some individuals marching from one place to another, while others protested in one spot." Most news media organization put the crowd at 12,000-15,000, but the Secret Service reported that there were just 3,000 participants. At the main rally in front of the Court, the usual line-up of speakers took the stage. Alex Jones shouted his usual incendiary combination of election claims and conspiracy theories. "Joe Biden is a globalist, and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another," he shouted.

Retired general Michael Flynn spoke, declaring that Donald Trump would remain in office for a second term. "We're in a crucible moment in the history of the United States," he said. "The courts aren't going to decide who the next president of the United States is going to be. We the people decide. "Destroy the GOP! Destroy the GOP!" he chanted. Founder of Stop the Steal, Ali Alexander (born Ali Abdul-Razaq Akbar), said that those assembled should get ready to take action to protect the nation if, "God forbid," the electoral college certified Biden on December 14. Katrina Pierson, the national spokesperson for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, also spoke. "We will utilize [the Courts] to the very end. And if that does not work, we will take our country back," she said.

Others appearing onstage included Sebastian Gorka, podcaster David Harris Jr., Nick Fuentes, and Mike Lindell. But the main instigator to appear on stage was Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes. He called on Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, and warned that not doing so would lead to a "much more bloody war." Daniel Paul Gray, who would later be indicted for his role in the January 6 protests, was in the crowd. He posted several Facebook statuses during the day. "Militia finna be lit y'all!!!, and, Shits about to get lit y'all. I'm actually really excited at the possibility of the insurrection act being implemented," he wrote. In another post, he seemed to make reference to upcoming protests to be held on January 6 (before Donald Trump's rally and speech had been announced). "Here is the move y'all. If they intend to certify a false election its gonna have to be to our faces," he wrote.

Gray then commented on another Facebook user's post with the following: "the only day that matters is the 20th [the day of the inauguration]. On the 6th a fucking shit ton of us are going to Washington to shut the entire city down. It's gonna be insane I literally can't wait. are you gonna be in DC on the 6th like trump asked us to be?" The protest itself included many Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and QAnon adherents. Proud Boys members, many clad in the paramilitary garb of body armor and military clothing and wearing their signature yellow and black shirts, receiving rousing applause. Later in the evening, after the rally dispersed, Proud Boys members prowled the streets, attacking what they thought were Antifa and Black Lives Matter supporters. Four people ended up being stabbed, including two Proud Boys and a Metropolitan Police Department officer. The protestors marched on DC churches and burned a Black Lives Matter banner displayed by the Asbury Methodist Church, one of the oldest Black churches in Washington. Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio would later be accused by authorities of burning a Black Lives Matter banner. Posted video showed Proud Boys squirting on lighter fluid.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, a member of the Proud Boys attacked a counter-protester while screaming "Fucking Jew." And according to other reports, the participants flashed white supremacist sign. Reverend Ianther M. Mills, Asbury's pastor, described the acts as "reminiscent of cross burnings" and expressed sadness that local police had failed to intervene.

Speaking to local radio station WTOP, Nene Taylor, co-organizer with Black Lives Matter said, "I hold Mayor Bowser responsible for this." "If Black people and people of color was to act like this, they would have done what they've been doing since [the] George Floyd protests started," she said. "Tear gassing us, beating us, and arresting us. That happened to none of the Proud Boys. The police was around and they done nothing to the white supremacists." Tarrio later claimed that the attack was not motivated by race, but rather because "BLM is a Marxist movement," adding, "the burning of this banner wasn't about race, religion or political ideology. It was about a racist movement that has terrorized the citizens of this country." He was referring to the summer of protests.

There were 33 arrests overall, for assault on a police officer, simple assault, riotous acts, possession of a prohibited weapon (a taser), and crossing a police line. During the day, Tarrio found time to visit the White House, a move that later would provoke many liberal conspiracy theorists to speculate that he met with President Trump. A White House spokesman said he was taking a public tour of the mansion's Christmas decorations.

The day's events seemed to signal a major break between the Proud Boys and law enforcement. According to an article about the Proud Boys published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point: "For years, the organization heavily promoted the 'Blue Lives Matter' narrative and movement, framing itself as pro-police and as standing side-by-side against their perceived shared adversary (antifa and Marxism) only to turn on police just before the January 6 rally in Washington, D.C., stating 'the police are starting to become a problem,' even though 'we've had their back for years.'"

President Trump boarded a Marine One helicopter from the south lawn of the White House on his way to the Army-Navy football game at West Point that day. He ordered the helicopter to overfly the crowd, tweeting at 3 p.m.: "Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them!" Arriving at the football game, Trump and White House Chief of Staff Meadows were joined in the VIP box by Congressional leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, as well Pentagon leaders including acting Secretary Chris Miller, his deputy Kash Patel, and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the joint chiefs of staff chairman.

Trump, Milley, and other members of the brass walked to the center of Michie Stadium for the commander-in-chief to toss the coin to determine which team would start on offense. Everyone in the group was wearing a mask except Trump. It was a foggy day on the Hudson River and the audience was somewhat reduced because of COVID. But the crowd, made up mostly of cadets and other Defense Department leaders, roared. "USA! USA!," they chanted.

# Did a Russian Cyberattack Affect the Election? Officials Couldn't Be Sure [41]

On December 13, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security issued an emergency directive requiring federal agencies to disable SolarWinds' Orion software because it posed a substantial security threat. Such "hacking" announcements, seemingly constant, are often difficult to assess regarding severity, and they almost always provoke reporting that screams greater and greater vulnerability. But in the case of the SolarWinds cyberattack, it was "one of the most widespread and sophisticated hacking campaigns ever conducted against the federal government and private sector," according to the Government Accountability Office.

The attack had repercussions on the focus and attitude of the national security agencies, and on the power of the deep state that so many insist doesn't exist. SolarWinds has more than 320,000 customers in 190 countries. The infected software was widely used by federal government agencies to monitor network activity and SolarWinds later estimated that nearly 18,000 of its users received the compromised software update. The Russian government was in, spying on compromised federal agency computers from May through December, reading emails and other documents. (Though 18,000 users received the compromised software update, over time, SolarWinds corporation tells Newsweek, the number of actual infected computers was much smaller. The Department of Homeland Security CISA later noted that, "a much smaller number [of computers] have been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems." SolarWinds later announced that "the actual number of customers who were hacked ... [were] fewer than 100.")

Beginning in September 2019, cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service breached the computing network of SolarWinds—an Austin, Texas-based network management company. The Russians managed, over five months, to inject hidden code into a file that later went out as part of SolarWinds' regular software updates for the Orion platform, their business software. The Trojan malware provided Russia with a "backdoor" to access infected computers. The Russian operators then were able to remotely exploit SolarWinds' customers. Just after the election, FireEye, a cybersecurity firm, detected an intrusion to its own systems and informed SolarWinds of the compromise of the Orion platform. SolarWinds begins notifying customers, posting on Twitter that it was asking "all customers to upgrade immediately to Orion Platform version 2020.2.1 HF 1 to address a security vulnerability." Microsoft also detected an intrusion into its cloud platforms, the company informing federal agencies that their systems had been breached.

On December 16, the Cyber Unified Coordination Group, responsible for coordinating government-wide responses, was activated. The Russians were probably reading the internal emails of the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State, Treasury, Energy, Labor, Commerce and Justice (including U.S. Attorney's offices and courts). The agencies using SolarWinds Orion software had their systems disconnected or powered down. President Donald Trump said nothing for days. When he did speak up on December 19 he suggested that China and not Russia might have been responsible, and that "everything is well under control."

The Department of Justice later said that around three percent of its email inboxes were compromised. The New York Times reported that the most senior Treasury Department officials' emails were compromised. Breach of court systems likely put at risk "sensitive case records and information that would be of great value to Russian intelligence, including trade secrets, investigative techniques, and information on targets of surveillance operations." The biggest worry, according to a senior intelligence official who has been involved in the damage assessment, is that Russia, through their Orion access, was able to burrow deeper into the electrical grid and even nuclear storage facilities, leaving backdoors for later use. The Russian Embassy in Washington denied any involvement, saying in a statement on December 14 that Russia "does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain."

In truth, Russia does. But the federal government, which spends billions annually on cybersecurity, never detected the intrusion: not on the networks, not in its intercepts, not from human agents. CISA, the agency also in charge of protecting the election infrastructure, detected nothing. The CIA and NSA detected nothing. "Russia should be held accountable," Joe Biden's Secretary of Defense, retired Army General Lloyd Austin, said during his confirmation hearing. Members of Congress called for America to retaliate. It should be "swift and clear," senators said.

Russia, the perpetual enemy, was the primary focus of the intelligence community as December moved into January. And because of SolarWinds, Justice and the FBI became deeply involved as well. There were discussions, according to the senior intelligence official (granted anonymity in order to speak about classified issues), whether CISA and the NSA could in fact know for sure that the election systems hadn't been compromised. SolarWinds was so sophisticated that it went undetected for over a year; as a result the FBI, in particular, doubled down on its many Russia-related cases, spooked as well as to whether they weren't missing a broader penetration into the fabric of American society. SolarWinds, as damaging as it might have been, provided the national security bureaucracy with a needed diversion and something to do at a time when the post-election chaos and the president's distraction left them powerless. Without the president, and with National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien checked out, the bureaucracy churned on SolarWinds. No one in the federal government was ever held accountable for the breach itself. By the time the Cyber Unified Coordination Group ceased their work on April 19, 2021, a new Deputy National Security Advisor for Cybersecurity had been created at the White House, another member of the bureaucracy. And more funding was secured for everyone.

# Donald Trump Griped about His Lack of Airtime as States Certified Joe Biden's Win [42]

On Monday, December 14, the 538 presidential electors that make up the Electoral College met in all fifty states and the District of Columbia to cast paper ballots as directed by law ("Monday after the second Wednesday in December on which the electors meet and vote"), confirming Joe Biden as the nation's next president. Amidst heightened security in state capitols and legislature buildings, and with masks on and practicing social distancing (Nevada electors met over Zoom), the electors counted the popular votes, casting their own ballots. The electors then signed six Certificates of the Vote, each containing two lists, one the electoral votes for the president and the other, the electoral votes for vice president. The governor then signed six Certificates of Ascertainment, certifying the vote and sealing the packages, which were then to be delivered, one to the president of the U.S. Senate (Vice President Mike Pence); two to the state-level secretary of state (or equivalent officer); two to the nation's Archivist; and one to the judge of the U.S. district court of the district in which the electors met.

The presidential electors gave Biden a solid majority of 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232, the same margin that Trump bragged was a landslide when he won the White House four years earlier. The results were to be tallied at the January 6 joint session of Congress over which Vice President Pence would preside. Any objections there to the electoral votes must be supported by at least one member of the House and one senator. The two chambers then meet separately to consider the objection. "Once again in America, the rule of law, our Constitution, and the will of the people have prevailed," Joe Biden said. "Our democracy—pushed, tested, threatened—proved to be resilient, true, and strong."

The "enormous political pressure, verbal abuse, and even threats of physical violence" regarding the election were "unconscionable," Biden said, and he labeled President Trump's efforts to overturn the election an "abuse of power."
"In America, politicians don't take power—the people grant it to them," Biden said.
"In this battle for the soul of America, democracy prevailed," he added. "We the people voted. Faith in our institutions held. The integrity of our elections remains intact. And so, now it is time to turn the page. To unite. To heal."

With the state-level Ascertainment, publicly ignored in most years because it is merely a formality, several Republican senators—Mike Braun (IN), Rob Portman (OH), John Thune (SD)—spoke out, saying that they accepted the final count and called for closure. In Arizona and Pennsylvania, Trump supporters marched outside their state capitols to protest the electoral college vote. A handful showed up in Michigan. There the state capitol complex was on lockdown for the electoral vote. Electors in Arizona met at an "undisclosed location" due to threats there. "This year's proceeding, which only occurs every four years, has unfortunately had an artificial shadow cast over it in the form of baseless accusations of misconduct and fraud—for which no proof has been provided and which court after court has dismissed as unfounded," said the state's Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. There was no concession from the White House.

In a Fox News interview that he had taped over the weekend, Trump said: "I worry about the country having an illegitimate president, that's what I worry about. A president that lost and lost badly."

> [A]ct NOW as a wartime President, pursuant to your oath to defend the Constitution, which is very similar to the oath all of us veterans swore. We are already in a fight. It's better to wage it with you as Commander-in-Chief than to have you comply with a fraudulent election, leave office, and leave the White House in the hands of illegitimate usurpers and Chinese puppets. Please don't do it. Do NOT concede, and do NOT wait until January 20, 2021. Strike now." "If you fail to act while you are still in office, we the people will have to fight a bloody civil war and revolution against these two illegitimate Communist Chinese puppets, and their illegitimate regime."

Attorney General Barr went to the White House in the late evening to speak to the president alone. According to Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It," the conversation between Trump and Barr was nothing like their last meeting two weeks earlier. "I think you know how much I've supported your administration and your policies," Barr said. At this point, he told Trump, the two were just butting heads and he would "just as soon leave now." Minutes after Electoral College final counts came in, Trump tweeted that Barr would be resigning, effective December 23. He tweeted: "Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family..."

# Mitch McConnell Hated Donald Trump More than He Loved Being Majority Leader [43]
 
 On December 15, the day after the Electoral College affirmed Joe Biden as the next president, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky quietly told White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that he planned to acknowledge that former Vice President Biden had won the presidency. That was before he had an epic conversation with Donald Trump. After the election, McConnell took up none of Donald Trump's questions about the elections, maintaining the position that the president had the right to challenge the results. But he had been silent on offering his former colleague and close friend Biden congratulations for the victory. Many interpreted McConnell's silence as tacit support for the president, and his lack of action annoyed many who thought that the senator should do something rather than humor the president. McConnell certainly pursued his own agenda in publicly breaking with Trump. But it wasn't just self-interest. McConnell hated Trump with the kind of personal animus that is often disregarded in the conventional narrative, or in journalism, to explain people's motivations. From the night of November 3, Election Day, according to Michael Wolff's "Landslide," McConnell was annoyed that Trump had done better than expected. When friends who asked which he preferred—a Trump victory and a Senate majority or a Trump loss and the loss of the Senate—McConnell chose the latter. He hated Trump even more than he loved being Majority Leader. "The animosity between the two men, Trump and McConnell, was total," Wolff wrote. "The Republican leader's view of Trump was as virulent as the most virulent liberal's view: Trump was ignorant, corrupt, incompetent, unstable."

"Every day for the past four years," Wolff wrote, "McConnell had struggled not to bend—at least not privately to bend, as so many others had—to the headbanger in the White House. "But it was impossible to overstate the hatred he had for Trump." McConnell had not figured that Trump would be capable of ignoring the reality of his loss, that even after every court rejected his claims and the Electoral College voted, that Trump would still upend the entire country on behalf of his ego.

McConnell went to the Senate floor:
> "Many millions of us had hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result. But our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on January 20. "Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories ... nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale—the massive scale—that would have tipped the entire election.... If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. "The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden."

Trump called McConnell immediately to excoriate the Senate leader, screaming obscenities at the second-most-powerful Republican in the nation. "Disloyal! Weak!," he tore into McConnell, according to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's "Peril." "It was a road-rage confrontation," Wolff wrote, Trump questioning McConnell's honesty, competence, patriotism and manhood. McConnell ended the call. "You lost the election. The Electoral College has spoken," he said. The ugly exchange was okay, McConnell later told aides, because it would be the last time he ever had to speak to the president (and indeed the two would not speak again for the remainder of the Trump presidency).

McConnell later told the Republican caucus in the Senate that the election fight was over, urging unanimity in not supporting the president's efforts. There was only a perfunctory January 6 ceremony left. Interest in the Senate for any kind of action to challenge the Electoral College seemed nonexistent. But in the House of Representatives, that wasn't the case. Nearly two-thirds of House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, supported a "friend of the court" briefing backing the Texas lawsuit before the Supreme Court.

The national council of the Three Percenters issued a statement about the Electoral College vote: "We stand ready and are standing by to answer the call from our President should the need arise that We The People are needed to take back our country from the pure evil that is conspiring to steal our country away from the American people. We are ready to enter into battle with General Flynn leading the charge. We will not act unless we are told to. And we will not act on our own as TTPO [The Three Percenters Original], but rather as a united body of American patriots." As the Electoral College vote was announced, Corrine Lee Montoni, 31, of Lakeland, Florida (who would later be arrested for her role on January 6), also posted on Instagram: "Trump is our leader. This is not over yet. January 6th is the day to keep an eye on and if that doesn't work, we will be in DC on the 20th letting the world know we REJECT progressive liberalism." Montoni also posted on Parler: "Insurrection Act coming in hot ... void the fraudulent 2020 election, arrest these traitors and restore order and faith in our justice department. GitMo is readyyyyyy." "If Pence betrays us, we riot," she posted on Parler on December 28.


# Don't Make Your FBI Director Pass a Loyalty Test, Donald Trump Was Told [44]

With the issue settled and the Electoral College vote concluded, all of Washington seemed to sigh with relief on December 16. General Services Administration administrator Emily Murphy spoke with the Federal News Network. "I wasn't picking or certifying the winner of the presidential election. Instead, it's the administrator's role under the Presidential Transition Act to determine ... what resources and services should be made available to the apparent successful candidate to assist in the event of a presidential transition," she said in her first public interview since the election.

"The actual winner of the presidential election is clearly determined by the electoral process outlined in the Constitution," Murphy added, clearly relieved that her outsize role in the presidential race was over.That same day, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies announced that the official ceremony for the Inauguration would take place on January 20, 2021. Because of COVID, the ceremony would have limited live attendance, but at least there was no longer any dispute about who would be sworn in. It was also reported that the White House Counsel's Office "strongly" advised President Donald Trump against firing FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom he had been taking potshots at. The Counsel's Office, according to NBC News, said that such a firing would risk "creating the perception that a 'loyalty test'" is required for a job that "traditionally has maintained independence from the White House."

The FBI announced it was beginning investigations to collect intelligence and identify, disrupt, and pursue SolarWinds hackers.

Operation Warp Speed, a COVID vaccine pursuit that many doubted, was also yielding fruit, with Pfizer vaccines starting to move across that country and be widely available to health care workers. The Food and Drug Administration said that the Moderna vaccine "was highly effective"; it was on track to be the second to be authorized for emergency use. And Congressional leaders said that they were close to a deal on a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package. The country seemed to be getting back to normal. And yet President Trump still had not officially conceded the election, and COVID was raging. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) announced that he would lead the effort to overturn the Electoral College by challenging the certification of the vote. The Pentagon's statement that it was taking a "holiday pause" on all transition meetings until January 1 was immediately denounced by the Biden camp. "There is no time to spare," said Yohannes Abraham, executive director of the transition team.

In both a backhand recognition of Biden's victory and a shot across the bow of the new administration, Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reportedly urged career employees to "be the resistance" when the new administration came in. And Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of the critical care unit at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston, Texas, said half of his staff was saying that they would not get the COVID vaccine "for political reasons," the harbinger of things to come. Meanwhile, the U.S. Capitol Police intelligence shop completed its first Special Event Assessment for January 6. The Assessment (Number 21-A-0468) said that there were "no specific known threats related to the Joint Session of Congress - Electoral College Vote Certification." "NO social media indications for specific threats or concerning comments directed at the Joint Session of Congress," the Assessment said. It acknowledged that "the threat of disruptive actions or violence cannot be ruled out." "At this time," the Assessment said, the Capitol Police were aware of only two planned protests, one by a pro-Trump group and the other by a pro-Biden group.

The December 16 assessment would be updated on three occasions before January 6. Each update including recently collected intelligence and new information about approved demonstrations. But the Congressional investigation would later find that Capitol Police intelligence "did not convey the full scope of known information to USCP leadership, rank-and-file officers, or law enforcement partners." Social media was filled with threatening information and calls for violence. The Congressional investigation concluded that though the intelligence division "possessed information about the potential for violence at the Capitol on January 6 [it] did not convey the full scope" of the threat to the bosses.

# Did Michael Flynn's 'Insane Rant' Reveal Media Bias? [45]

"President Trump won on the third of November" retired Army General Michael Flynn insisted in a Newsmax television interview on December 17. He went through a litany of foreign interference and promoted martial law as an option, pooh-poohing those who questioned whether the declaration would be legal or unprecedented. "Flynn's insane rant," University of Texas law professor Steve Vladek said, according to Yahoo!. "Just a retired general and former undeclared foreign agent for an authoritarian regime, freshly pardoned by the president for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia, tweeted Slate's Will Saletan. "The former national security advisor's remarks are not based in reality," Business Insider said. "The thought of the insane mad man in the room when Trump was making decisions is frightening," Tim Miler of The Bulwark tweeted. Reaction to the interview was everywhere—but good luck finding the original Newsmax interview. For example, the Business Insider interview doesn't link back to Newsmax but to the Daily Beast, which itself links back to another Daily Beast article making fun of Flynn. Yahoo! links back to an unrelated article in The Week and to PoliticalWire, which has no links. Real Clear Politics doesn't link back to Newsmax either. Only The Hill does.

Search on Google for "Michael Flynn," "martial law" and "December 17, 2020," looking for a link to Newsmax, and the journalism sites that come up about Flynn's interview are The Hill, PoliticalWire, Real Clear Politics and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette. Remove the quotes from December 17, 2020, and Daily Beast, Business Insider and Yahoo! are added, as well popular tweeter Aaron Rupar.In either case, Newsmax's Flynn interview is the 16th response, on page 2, through YouTube. The Newsmax original site does not appear until page 5, the 55th result. Is Newsmax being ignored—or even worse, suppressed? The Google searches and mainstream links would seem to reveal some kind of algorithmic shenanigans.

Newsmax is a conservative news site founded in 1998, with the television channel launched in June 2014. Originally positioned as a competitor to Fox News, the channel stood out as a platform for certain personalities—Bill O'Reilly and Mark Halperin—following their disappearance from the mainstream after #Metoo scandals. In terms of influence, it's estimated that Newsmax reaches 10 percent of American adults, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew says Newsmax's audience is similar to the shares that The Hill and Huffpost receive.

After the November election, Newsmax got a boost as a result of Donald Trump's feud with Fox News (Fox was the first network to say Biden had carried Arizona), and the president openly promoted the channel after that. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Newsmax's TV ratings grew tenfold, its prime time shows rivaling MSNBC. Newsmax TV exceeded Fox News in viewership at the end of December 2020, but lost viewers after the January 6 Capitol riot.

Since then, Newsmax has returned to trying to position itself closer to the mainstream, publishing a retraction and apology to Dominion Voting Systems after the company sued for its false allegations. According to the Knight Foundation, "Most Americans see bias in their go-to news source; 21% see 'a great deal' and another 36% see 'a fair amount' of bias in the news source they rely on most often." Two-thirds of Republicans have a "very" or "somewhat" unfavorable opinion of the news media, the Foundation says. Three-fourths of all Americans say the spread of "misinformation" is "a major problem," exceeding all other challenges posed in the news media. Steve, the Carlsbad, California, member of the Proud Boys interviewed exclusively by Newsweek, said he thinks that all media is biased, including conservative sites, "hence their very labels, as if conservative automatically means bias."

Steve sees an active campaign by "the elite" to silence alternate views. "They say conspiracy theories and white nationalists and hate speech as to why certain voices don't deserve to be heard, but, hey, that's part of a narrative that dismisses my entire world," he says, "one that I think has legitimacy, as much as Black Lives Matter." "... Saying that Donald Trump pulled the strings after the elections, or that he's doing so now, is just as much a conspiracy theory. First, it isn't true. But more importantly, it just says a huge segment of America is nothing more than zombies rather than recognizing that we have real issues to raise about the direction of the country, issues that aren't going to go away." "Being shut down and shut out, even after 70 million of us voted for the only person that wasn't Joe Biden, is the goal. That's why we need alternative media, even social media, because an elite few decide what can be heard. Surprise, surprise. So much for the First Amendment."


# Donald Trump's 'Bizarre' Meeting: Cursing, Screaming, Swedish Meatballs [46]

December 18 was a typical day in Donald Trump's Oval Office, more chaos than order, more free-wheeling talk show than White House decorum, more a scene from the bunker than some diabolical battle plan. The constantly tweeting president had barely been out in public in six weeks: he'd given up on governing and had narrowed his circle of contacts, creating his own echo chamber of encouragement and canned applause. That evening's five-hour gathering involved a revolving cast of characters featuring retired Army General Michael Flynn and Rudy Giuliani-sidekick and sometimes campaign lawyer Sidney Powell. They decided to make a spontaneous visit to the White House, arriving about 6:15 p.m., eventually wandering into the Oval at about 7:30.

The duo was joined by former Overstock.com chief executive Patrick Byrne, who was pushing his own theories of the loss; and Emily Newman, an obscure Trump "White House policy advisor" who also served in the homeland security department and with the Agency for Global Media.

It was "a meeting so bizarre, long, and out of control that it may go down in history as the strangest meeting Donald Trump, or any other president, ever had in the White House," wrote Jonathan Karl in "Betrayal."

Flynn, who had not met with Trump since he left the administration in February 2017, was there to outline his plan for martial law: how Trump could mobilize the National Guard and have them rerun the election.

Trump mused about ordering the military to act, what they would be able to do. He called in White House counsel Pat Cipollone, and according to Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It," the two had a screaming match about the possibility and propriety.

"I was going to bury my knuckles in his throat," Patrick Byrne would late write, saying he was standing shoulder to shoulder with Flynn, facing off against Cippollone, and White House lawyers Eric Herschmann and Derek Lyons.

Byrne called Herschmann a quitter and they got into another screaming match. According to Axios, Herschmann shouted: "Do you even know who the fuck I am, you idiot?"

"Yeah, you're Patrick Cipollone," Byrne said.

"Wrong! Wrong, you idiot!" Herschmann barked.

Nothing was decided.

At some point the meeting moved to the residence. Soon a White House butler brought drinks and appetizers of Swedish meatballs for everyone.

Riffing off of Flynn, Sidney Powell laid out a plan for Trump to declare a national emergency and issue a presidential order to take control of the continued vote count and to seize the voting machines. She continued to push her claims of voting machines controlled by China, Iran, Venezuela, Marxists and communists. She even slammed Rudy Giuliani for being insufficiently in the loop. Rudy, she said, hadn't understood what the steal was all about—that it was foreign interference. Trump called Robert O'Brien at home. One of the lawyers now present on the phone, Cipollone or Matt Morgan from the campaign, asked the national security advisor "whether he had any national security information regarding Powell's claim of foreign governments hijacking voting machines," wrote Leonnig and Rucker. There was none. Trump still wanted action, talking about seizing the voting machines. Then the president decided that he wanted to appoint Powell Department of Justice Special Counsel to investigate the elections. He wanted to give her a security clearance to examine the intelligence. Everyone objected; White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, on the phone, discouraged the move. Nothing was decided. Trump then called Rudy Giuliani, who was in a Georgetown restaurant, and asked him to come to the White House. Giuliani rushed right over. He had no interest in seizing the machines or promoting Powell (which might leave him in her shadow). He and Powell had another titanic fight.

Earlier in the week, according to rumors, Giuliani had himself pushed the Department of Homeland Security to seize the voting machines and examine them to determine if they could change votes. The department, according to a homeland security general counsel, who spoke to Newsweek on condition of anonymity, replied that it had no authority to act. The meeting itself now veered, according to the Axios account, from martial law to misspellings in Sidney Powell' s legal briefs.

Administration officials drifted in and out, others staying on the epic conference call. Some of the leakers and storytellers say that they ("White House officials") saw Trump's continuing refusal to accept the Electoral College vote as sign of the president drifting into dangerous territory, that they were there to stop anything crazy from happening. Patrick Byrne tweeted: "The raised voices included my own. I can promise you: President Trump is being terribly served by his advisers. They want him to lose and are lying to him." "@senatemajldr [Mitch McConnell] and Republican Senators have to get tougher," Trump tweeted, "or you won't have a Republican Party anymore. We won the Presidential Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don't let them take it away!" "What happened in the Oval Office that day .. was not so much an indication of a strategy or even part of the process of formulating a plan, but instead, consisted of the random comings and goings of random people," Michael Wolff wrote in "Landslide." Wolff observed that two days earlier, when Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks announced that he would mount a January 6 challenge to the Electoral College, "Nobody from the White House was actually in touch with him. Nobody was coordinating with anybody. Nobody from the White House was managing what in the real world would need to be one of the greatest congressional confrontations of modern times." Trump appeared to have no real purpose other than being in the center. As Michael Wolff wrote, "Indeed there existed the possibility that overturning the election was not even his main goal. Rather, the joy and energy of the resulting chaos was." The meeting broke up close to midnight. Nothing was decided.

# Ecstatic Donald Trump Fans Retweeted His Call for 'Wild' Protests [47]

On Saturday, December 19, President Donald Trump conveyed his first public notice of a "big protest in DC" to be held on January 6, the day Congress was to convene in a Joint Session to certify the electoral vote. "Be there," he tweeted, "will be wild!" "The calvary [sic] is coming, Mr. President!" tweeted Kylie Jane Kremer in response, one of the leaders of the "Women for America First" coalition. "The President is calling on us to come back to Washington on January 6th for a big protest—'Be there, will be wild'," the official poster announced.
Trump retweeted Kremer's post, saying: "A great honor!"

"Thank you for the RT [retweet] @realDonaldTrump," Kremer answered. "We hope you come out and join us!!"

Kremer and the president got thousands of retweets and comments, most supportive, with declarations from individuals near and far, that they were coming. But there were also a fair share of mocking responses, a battle of the memes.

"CALLING ALL PATRIOTS! Be in Washington D.C. January 6th. This wasn't organized by any group. DJT has invited us and it's going to be 'wild'," Kelly O'Brien posted on December 19th. "Warning. Beware elite establishment. We are ready and we are going to fight you with everything we have. You will not win. We will triumph over your evil," she continued, saying that the protestors were "coming for you Antifa ... WE ARE IN A BATTLE between GOOD and evil." She said that January 6 would "be one of the greatest experiences [and] the duty of all able Patriots." But not for the faint at heart. "Violence can and will break out." Kelly O'Brien was later arrested for her role on January 6. Alan Hostetter posted from his 'americanphoenixproject' Instagram account: "This is the date of the Joint Session of Congress in which they will either accept or reject the fake/phony/stolen electoral college votes." Hostetter was later arrested for his role on January 6.

Graydon Young wrote on a Facebook group wall: "Please check out Oath Keepers as a means to get more involved. Recruiting is under way. DM me if you want more info." Young was later arrested for his role on January 6. Gina Bisignano tweeted "I'll be there" in response to Donald Trump's call. Bisignano was later arrested for his role on January 6. Kelly Meggs wrote a series of messages on Facebook: "Trump said It's gonna be wild!!!!!!! It's gonna be wild!!!!!!! He wants us to make it W I L D that's what he's saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to D C pack your shit!!" Meggs was later arrested for his role on January 6. Matthew Loganbill posted on Facebook: "They haven't seen a riot, til our side gets started." He posted a comment directed at two Senators. "If you do not possess the courage to fight against the evil that is destroying our once great nation so be it. ... The American people are becoming desperate for truth and morality. Politicians who don't represent that and act for the hearts of the true Americans will be held accountable. Complacency is not an option." Loganbill was later arrested for his role on January 6. Kenneth Reda posted: "We have got to get to DC on January 6th it is IMPERATIVE every single person that VOTED for Trump has to flood DC ..." Reda was later arrested for his role on January 6. Mark Sahady posted: "It is important that millions of Americans show up in DC on January 6 to support the legitimate President, Donald Trump, and show Democrats what they will be facing if they continue to try and steal the Presidency." Sahady was later arrested for his role on January 6.

Christopher Quaglin posted on Facebook: "Come to DC. Don't be a bitch." Quaglin was later arrested for his role on January 6. The U.S. Park Police, responsible for security on the National Mall and the grounds around the White House and the U.S. Capitol, reported on December 19: "We've been seeing some vague calls for action ... calling for a march on the Capitol. Not seeing anything gain traction yet. NO permit applications. We'll See." The U.S. Capitol Police intelligence discussed internally and with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) President Trump's tweet. They flagged a Million MAGA March tweet saying that January 6 would be "the Biggest Protest in American History," and a Parler post calling for an occupation of Washington, the Congress, the Supreme Court and the White House.

The MPD responded to the U.S. Capitol Police: "Good Morning All, I hate to be the Christmas Grinch but please see below post regarding a possible big demo on January 6th. So far there have not been any permit applications for this that I am aware of. We are hoping this is a hoax but will keep digging to vet this information." The next morning, the domain name wildprotest.com is registered to host a website advertising a protest near the Capitol building from 10 am to 5 pm on January 6.



# Even Donald Trump's COVID Infection, Vaccination, Didn't Change Republican Views [48]

On Sunday, December 20, Moderna started shipping the first six million doses of its new vaccine to sites across the nation. The first shots were promised to be available on Monday. In Wilmington, Delaware, the cameras were being set up so that President-elect Joe Biden could receive his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on live television. The Pfizer vaccine was authorized for emergency use on December 2. Vice President Mike Pence was also vaccinated live on air. He said he "didn't feel a thing" and that the vaccine was "safe and effective." Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also received vaccines.

While some criticized Donald Trump for being missing in action as the vaccination programs began to gather steam, Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CBS's Face the Nation that, given that the president had COVID in October and had been treated with an experimental antibody, there was hesitancy to vaccinate him within 90 days to avoid any complications. Then White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany contradicted Adams. She told reporters that Trump was holding off on getting a vaccine, in part, "to show Americans that our priority are the most vulnerable."

Dr. Anthony Fauci then also contradicted Adams. "Even though the president himself was infected, and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective," he told ABC News, "we're not sure how long that protection lasts. So, to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated." White House coronavirus czar Assistant Secretary for Health Administration Brett Giroir also called for Trump to be vaccinated. "I would encourage the president to get the vaccine for his own health and safety, and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely," he told ABC's This Week Sunday.

With Christmas approaching, were vaccines a Trump issue or a partisan issue? It was an important question to answer with the holidays coming up and the emergence of a new variant of the virus spreading through the U.K. and Europe. Despite Pence's and McConnell's public vaccinations, half of Republicans polled said they would likely not get vaccinated, compared to 73 percent of Democrats, a Gallup poll found. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 44 percent of Republicans wouldn't take a shot. Anti-COVID agitation started soon after the virus appeared, with people questioning everything from the actual threat of the pandemic to the need for lockdowns or even masks. From the very beginning, the divide seemed to be partisan, especially with the president's lackadaisical attitude about government rules and practices. Even after Trump contracted COVID, his attitude didn't seem to change much.

Questions accumulated: not just commonsense ones about whether the vaccine had been insufficiently tested, whether schools or employers could impose mandates, and what could be imposed through executive directive versus law. Or the pre-COVID traditional questions that existed from a core anti-vaxxer community in America, not just disproven theories like vaccines causing autism. But there were also new questions about the COVID vaccine: whether it was toxic and deadly, about allergic reactions, about whether it had been developed using human fetal cells, whether it had been tested on animals, even whether it was kosher and halal. And then there were the extreme views, that "mandatory" anything was the slippery slope to government control (even to taking away people's guns), that the vaccine contained a government-inserted secret microchip or turned people into 5G zombies. Or whether even the Democrats created an entire pandemic conspiracy to institute mail-in voting, which was the basis to steal votes.

So the spectacle of government officials disagreeing about the president's vaccine only fueled public confusion and uncertainty. This wasn't just a matter of spin or pro-Trump versus anti-Trump voices. Under it all was the traditional American question of government power and control, of the very definition of personal freedom.

In this uncertain moment, everyone was searching for information and explanations. It was characteristic of the social media era and the loss of trust in the news media. But it was also characteristic of the Trump era, and beyond blaming him for the politicization of the pandemic, few analysts looked beyond Trump himself to the reasons he was elected in the first place.


# Donald Trump Supporters Targeted the Capitol: 'Bring Guns. It's Now or Never' [49]

The U.S. Capitol Police intelligence division issued a seven-page report on December 21 containing the first specifics regarding a threat to the Capitol building itself. It was an alarming forecast, surveying social media postings about the upcoming protest, a build-up, one might think, for extraordinary measures in the face of threats of violence and taking over the Capitol building. "Investigative Research and Analysis Report" (21-TD-159) highlighted a posting on the now-defunct blog thedonald.win which referenced tunnels on Capitol grounds used by Members of Congress (and particularly important for continuity of government evacuations). The report attached an underground map of the Capitol campus that was posted onllne. "There are tunnels connected to the Capitol Building! Legislators use them to avoid press, among other things! Take note," the blog posted.

The intelligence report then went to flag "several comments promote confronting members of Congress and carrying firearms during the protest." The report contained approximately 30 screen shots of comments on the thedonald.win website, including:

- "Bring guns. It's now or never."
- "Surround every building with a tunnel entrance/exit. They better dig a tunnel all the way to China if they want to escape."
- "Exactly, forget the tunnels. Get into Capitol Building, stand outside congress. Be in the room next to them. They wont [sic] have time -[to] run if they play dumb."
- "Deploy [sic] Capitol Police to restrict [their] movement. Anyone going armed needs to be mentally prepared to draw down on LEOs. Let them shoot first, but make sure they know what happens if they do."
- "If they don't show up, we enter the Capitol as the Third Continental Congress and certify the Trump Electors."
- "If a million patriots who [sic, show] up bristling with AR's [AR-15 rifles], just how brave do you think they'll be when it comes to enforcing their unconstitutional laws? Don't cuck out. This is do or die.
- "Bring your guns."

The December 21 Report listed a variety of "Patriot Organizations" that were expected to show up on January 6, including the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. It also said that "secure communications" were likely to be used by protestors, and well as the use of Signal and Wickr. Though U.S. Capitol Police preparations began with Donald Trump's December 19 announcement, the report seemed to have no impact. The intelligence division continued to work on updating its Special Assessment, given that "[s]ocial media ha[d] exploded . . . with information about January 6th events," according to the Senate investigation of failures on January 6.

The investigation concluded that the Capitol Police received "significant information about the rising likelihood of violence ...."The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) also sent out an email on December 21 to its local, state, and federal law enforcement partners, including the U.S. Capitol Police. "This is the big one! Donald Trump is calling for this March himself," MPD said. The Department said that whatever would unfold on January 6 would be "similar to the November 14th and December 12th events," noting that permit applications had already been submitted.

With January 6 now looming, an amended permit application was submitted to the National Park Service. The responsible government official, Marisa Richardson, wrote an email about the amended application to others in the Park Service hierarchy. "The new date for the demonstration is now January 5-7 with the event date of January 6. She [the organizer, will not conduct a demonstration from January 23-25. The change is a result of President Trump tweeting and it's the day Congress counts the electoral college votes. ... [organizer Cindy Chafian] estimates an attendance of 15,000." The venue hadn't yet been determined. Richardson says that the application's preferred location is Freedom Plaza or the Lincoln Memorial. That day, MPD police chiefs briefed District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser for the first time, telling her that the department was beginning to craft a security plan for January 6th, cooperating with the federal authorities and in talks with the military.

The D.C. National Guard had already begun planning its presence at the upcoming Inauguration, scheduled for January 20. That event, a regular ritual for police and Guard organizations, begins its contingency planning some six months prior. For Joe Biden's Inauguration, approximately 30 states had already pledged to send about 4,000 Guard members. But no action had yet been taken regarding January 6. Arieh Kovler, a political analyst, tweeted on December 21: "On January 6, armed Trumpist militias will be rallying in DC, at Trump's orders. It's highly likely that they'll try to storm the Capitol after it certifies Joe Biden's win. I don't think this has sunk in yet." In his epic thread, Kovler said: "To be clear here, I don't think the 3%ers, Proud Boys, Oathkeepers or boogaloo types are going to seize the Capitol. But some of them are going try. And people will die.

"On January 6, armed Trumpist militias will be rallying in DC, at Trump's orders. It's highly likely that they'll try to storm the Capitol after it certifies Joe Biden's win. I don't think this has sunk in yet.

# Donald Trump Pardoned Military Rank-and-File But Hated 'My Generals' [50]

"The pre-Christmas pardons and commutations came as the president has been exploring how to reward friends and allies in his waning days in the White House, with more acts of clemency expected to come," the Washington Post wrote. The Post said that Trump was "using the power of his office to undo the work of the Russia probe." "A move that further cements his legacy of exercising his sweeping powers to benefit his political allies," ABC News said. "If there is a governing principle in who appears most likely to secure clemency," CNN wrote, "it is someone the President either knows personally or who has powerful connections lobbying on their behalf. At least one person working on behalf of clients seeking pardons said they hoped their loyalty to Trump over the past four years would pay off now." Earlier in July, Trump pardoned Roger Stone, convicted of lying under oath to Congress; and on November 25, he pardoned former national security advisor retired Army General Michael Flynn, who was charged also with lying to the FBI.

Everything that Donald Trump did at the end of his administration had outsize effect, and the pardons were no exception. Trump was criticized for undermining the Department of Justice "system" and obstructing justice, and for "his propensity for self-dealing." The whiff of cronyism or self-enrichment wasn't unprecedented. President Bill Clinton had equally pardoned 140 people as he left office, and his pardons also skewed in the direction of political cronies. What was different, and most controversial, about Trump's grants of clemency was that the president inserted himself into military cases. In 2019, Trump granted full pardons to Michael Behenna, an Army First Lieutenant convicted of killing an Iraqi in detention; Clint Lorance, another Army Lieutenant convicted of killing Afghani villagers; and Major Mathew Golsteyn, who was in the middle of court-martial proceedings for killing a suspected Afghan bomb-maker. Trump also granted clemency to Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher, who had been convicted of taking a "trophy photo" with the body of an ISIS fighter.

Critics would argue in December 2020 that these military pardons were exceptional. Though many associated the Blackwater pardons with pressure or reward for Trump associate Erik Prince, the head of Blackwater and brother of Trump administration Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, the issue was really Trump's relationship with the military.

In the hyperbolic American debate, the word "war crimes" is bandied about, often essentially equating the genocidal campaigns of Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic with individual acts on the battlefield. Convicting any of these men of a crime inherently states that they broke the law, but the distance from there to having committed or been convicted of a war crime is vast.

"Certainly the appetite for total victory in the American military has disappeared," says a retired Army general, who spoke to Newsweek on condition of anonymity, criticizing the hyper vigilance and even fear regarding civilian casualties. "Couple that with a decentralization facilitated by technologies that increasingly place fewer and fewer soldiers in the field, on their own." The end result, he says, is that "wars drag on" to unsatisfying conclusions, "the fifth, six, seventh rotation of soldiers schooled about how hopeless the situation is, and how dangerous everyone is. "Trophy-taking and even indiscriminate killing, more a reflection of command climate than indictment of the individual soldier, is a statement of frustration and a manifestation of fighting without glory, without victory as purpose." Donald Trump might have upset precedent in these military cases, and he may have ignored the specifics of the charges against each of the men, but there is a certain thread that runs through all of the pardons. It is sympathy for the rank and file in the military—and a deep hatred of the federal government and the Washington bureaucracy.

There is no evidence to conclude that Trump was specifically currying favor with the military in these grants of clemency. More likely, he felt that the war was what needed to be indicted, not the soldiers. Trump's many statements about the military during his presidency consistently pushed the view that the brass should take responsibility for failed war, even for the chaos that they oversaw that put soldiers in untenable situations. In other words, Trump was taking another swipe at "his generals," building common cause with a certain military/veteran/law enforcement community that hadn't coalesced since Ronald Reagan. "A higher number that expected people [sic] have already made concerted plans to travel to the District of Columbia for the event," the Park Police said.

"The protests/rallies [are] expected to be similar to the previous Million MAGA March rallies in November and December 2020," the U.S. Capitol Police agreed in their December 23 "Special Assessment" (21-A-0468 V.2). 


# Exclusive: Classified Documents Reveal the Number of January 6 Protestors [51]

On December 23, pro-Trump organizer Cindy Chafian sent a follow-up email about the planned January 6 event, saying that 15,000 participants were expected. "All available evidence," the U.S. Park Police wrote in an internal report the same day, "indicates that we should expect an event similar to those that occurred on 14 November 2020 and 12 December 2020." The Park Police highlighted that "opposition groups ... plan[ed] to counter-protest ... as they have in the past."

The Secret Service added: "There are approximately fifty nine (59) groups identified as potentially participating in First Amendment activities on January 6, 2021 at or around the White House Complex (WHC) ... Expected attendance is around 20,000 participants." Six times as many protestors—as many as 120,000—would show up on the Mall on January 6, according to classified numbers still not released by the Secret Service and the FBI but seen by Newsweek. But there is still not an official estimate, nor have any of the Congressional committees or task forces offered a number. Nor is there a clear number of how many people actually entered the Capitol, or tried to get in. These numbers, and a specific number who climbed Capitol Hill, or assaulted the building, how many forced there way in, and how many merely walked in, is all the more important in assessing the percentage of those who were violent, how many were associated with extremist groups, and indeed how many were there: that is, was it just a routine event dominated by insurrectionists, or was it a grass roots movement?

A deeper evaluation can be made based upon the arrests that have already been made. Federal prosecutors have charged more than 700 people with participating in the protests at the U.S. Capitol, and new indictments and arrests are still continuing almost daily. Early in the arrests (when the number was closer to 400), most news media outlets said some 800 people entered the Capitol, but now the number—circulating in classified assessments made by the Secret Service and the FBI, and obtained exclusively by Newsweek—is 1,200.

Of these arrests, is it estimated, based on indictments, documents, and statements, that fewer than 15 percent were affiliated with any organized group. In other words, of the 700-plus so far arrested, over 600 were unaffiliated protestors. Were those who committed violence and entered the Capitol part of a "pre-planned" attack, involving "participants from a number of states who came well equipped, coordinated, and prepared to carry out a violent insurrection at the United States Capitol," as former U.S. Capitol Police chief Steven Sund claimed, or was it a spontaneous event?

Getting the numbers right is essential. Did the assumption that there would be some 20,000 protestors in the District of Columbia that day stand in the way of competent contingency planning?

Were the protests dominated by the military, as some suggest? An estimated 10 percent of protestors were affiliated with the military or law enforcement, the vast majority of them veterans. About seven percent of the overall adult population in the United States is made up of veterans, meaning that the number at the Capitol on January 6 is only slightly greater than the population at large. Did federal law enforcers have sympathy for the protestors and hold back on security? Whether the Capitol Police and District's Metropolitan Police Department were strategic in their approach is a different question if there were 120,000 protestors versus 20,000. It's likely they were simply overwhelmed by superior numbers.

By the time January 6 arrived, after another amendment had been submitted by the Ellipse organizers, the permit was issued for an estimated 30,000 participants. Approximately 25,000 participants were screened by Secret Service Uniformed Division officers to get into the restricted area where Donald Trump was speaking on January 6. An additional 15,000 positioned themselves between the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, outside the restricted area, according to still-classified Secret Service data. The Federal Protective Service made its own internal estimates, pointing out that there were actually three major rallies with permits for January 6. The first was the Ellipse, permitted for 30,000 but swamped by "much more," according to FPS documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. The two other protests were at Freedom Plaza, originally permitted for 5,000 but raised to 30,000; and the Sylvan theater south of the Washington Monument, permitted for 15,000 more. That's a total of 75,000, just for permitted events. None of this is to say that the federal authorities ever correctly predicted the magnitude of those attending. Former Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen told Congress, "I received reports that MPD and others estimated that between 10,000 and 30,000 people would be coming for the rallies or protests on January 6—a sizable, but not unprecedented number."

Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller told the Congress that some 8,000 "local and Federal law enforcement officers were on duty in the District of Columbia" on January 6. "I was told during planning sessions leading up to January 6 that such a force routinely manages demonstrations well north of 100,000 demonstrators."

Rosen testified that on January 6, he spoke to acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, who was present on the Ellipse, "to inquire if the crowd size there was consistent with or larger than the forecasts." Sherwin told him that "the size of the crowd was on the lower side of the forecast and conceivably might have been below the lower end of the range." There are many reasons that crowd sizes get inflated or deflated. Large size is a symbol of popularity, especially in the Trump era, and estimates of how many people congregate is often overstated. It seems, though, that many people—those blaming it all on Donald Trump, those defending their being overwhelmed, those claiming a well-planned attack, those blaming the Trump Pentagon for not taking swifter action—has an interest in being content with a low estimate, in not admitting that that 120,000 people were there to show solidarity with the president, believing that the election was indeed stolen. The low number also makes the proportion of those who entered the Capitol seem larger (about one percent), as it does make the number of law enforcement, military and veterans seem disproportionate (in reality, a percentage no greater than the percentage in society overall). In other words, the total number is crucial to understanding what happened on January 6.

# Mike Pence Fed the Illusion that Donald Trump Might Prevail [52]

Donald Trump entered the holiday season as fixated as ever on overturning the results of the election. "VOTER FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, IT IS A FACT!!!" he tweeted on December 24. The night before, Trump flew to Florida to spend the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago home. Flying with him on Air Force One: Rudy Giuliani, the president's Number One cheerleader, who was spending Christmas with the Trumps. Upon arriving at his golf club that Thursday, the president "received a warm welcome from members," according to CNN. Fellow golfers were excited that Trump wasn't giving up the fight. Vice President Mike Pence was on Trump's mind, though. The two men were fundamentally different. Pence, deeply conservative and a conscientious holder of his office, was never close to or buddies with the showman.

Donald Trump tweeted on Christmas Eve: "Mike Pence MUST do this ... defend our Constitution from our enemies: Foreign: China, Russia, Iran..." This was the only way for Trump to directly communicate; their meetings at this point were formal and perfunctory. Pence was reaching out to everyone—Constitutional lawyers, former vice presidents, Congressional leaders—and every one of them told him he had no role to play in the vote count on January 6, other than the pro forma ceremonial role. The Constitution was clear: Congress certified the electoral votes that had already been counted. As president of the Senate, Pence presided. But he didn't have to. Vice President Hubert Humphrey didn't preside, turning over the duties to the President Pro Tempore, the senior member.

Trump and his supporters, of course, had their own theory of what was possible, the Pence could reject the electors in swing states, substituting in Trump electors. It was preposterous, but Trump and the campaign produced their own experts, lawyers, and kibitzers who happily contradicted the facts, making up their own path to reversing the election when the Joint Session of Congress met. What was Donald Trump to think? Though Pence, by all accounts, was struggling with the personal and ethical dilemma of making the final break with Donald Trump, he also continued to publicly support the president, creating the illusion that he might come through. Speaking to a group of young conservatives in Florida earlier in the week, Pence exhorted the crowd to "keep fighting until every legal vote is counted" and "every illegal vote is thrown out." "Stay in the fight for election integrity. Stay in the fight to defend all we've done," Pence said. "Four more years!" "Stop the steal!" the crowd chanted. Official Washington—"the swamp," the high-and-mighty, as John Bolton called them, the lawyers and lobbyists, the bureaucracy—concluded overwhelmingly that the election was over. Donald Trump and his supporters were merely bellowing conspiracies and fantastic claims, they thought. It was all theater to stoke the president's ego. Donald Trump was responsible for riling people up, they thought, dismissing the 70 million who had voted for him as ignorant, illiterate, ridiculous.

And yet, outside Washington, the national angst was deep and there was genuine confusion and concern. It wasn't just a group of young Republicans. It wasn't just Trump's golf club. Take, for instance, the experience of Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, when he went back to Utah for Christmas.

According to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's "Peril," Senator Lee "began hearing from friends, neighbors, family members about the election being stolen ... People who would not be regarded as being on the fringe of society—mayors, city council men, county commissioners, sheriffs—said that were expecting to go back to Washington and 'stop the steal.' Text messages, social media posts, people who got his phone number wanting to know what was going on. How was the election stolen? What are you going to do?"

"Cancel culture" Trump tweeted, railing against Twitter for "going wild with their flags, trying hard to suppress even the truth. Just shows how dangerous they are, purposely stifling free speech. Very dangerous for our Country." "This is how Communism starts," Trump raged.

Donald Trump's army was ready to go to war for their president, to prevent communism, to defend the nation. They sought a sense of patriotic duty, expressed in their quasi-military pretensions and even their dress. "Who wants to go to dc?" Christopher Quaglin posted on Facebook on December 24, "I have an extra double twin bed available."

"Driving in with my wife from Berryville VA," Donavan Ray Crawl posted on Facebook. "Meeting up with Oathkeepers from North Carolina and Patriot group from the Shenandoah Valley." Ronald Mele posted on Facebook that he and three friends were thinking of renting a car to drive cross-country, "arriving January 5 to support our President on the 6th and days to follow just in case." The following day, he explained in another Facebook post that he was "going to rent a suburban. Team of four rotating eight hours each. Need room for the 'gear.'"

"[I]t is IMPERATIVE that we let our elected federal officials know in both the Senate and the house that we will not be voting for them again if they do not support our President Trump on January 6th when they are counting Electoral College votes ..." Kenneth Reda posted. Benjamin Burlew spoke to a family member on a call that day as well, saying he planned to "storm the Capitol." "By bullet or ballot," Ryan Taylor Nichols posted on Facebook. "Restoration of the Republic is Coming." "That's my basement gun room," Quaglin captioned a photo. "I have been planning for this since fucking Bush left office and Obama came in" All six were later arrested for their roles on January 6.

#Christmas Day Bombing Raised Fears of Donald Trump Conspiracists as Terrorists [53]

At 5:30 a.m. on December 25, Christmas Day, a large mobile home detonated on a deserted stretch of 2nd Avenue North in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, nearly collapsing one building and damaging 41 others, shattering windows and sending shrapnel into the early morning street. Trees were knocked to the ground, and Second Avenue took on the charred look of a battleground. Eight people were injured, including three bystanders who were hospitalized. Two Nashville police officers who had just arrived in the area after the RV broadcast warning messages also received minor injuries. The message broadcast loudly was "This area must be evacuated now. If you can hear this message, evacuate now."

The RV was parked in front of 166 2nd Avenue, right outside an AT&T telephone exchange, also serving as a switching and transmission center. An AT&T spokesman said the company's network hub was damaged and cellphone and Internet services in the Nashville area, middle Tennessee and Kentucky were affected, reaching as far south as Alabama. 911 emergency services were disrupted in numerous cities and towns. "Given the damage to our facility, it will take time to restore service," AT&T posted on its website. "We have already rerouted significant traffic from this facility and are bringing in other equipment, including numerous portable cell sites to the area." Nashville Mayor John Cooper signed an executive order declaring a state of civil emergency and enacting a 4:30 p.m. curfew within the downtown area.

K-9 teams searched around the area for bombs. Radiation monitors were brought in. Public transportation was suspended. Due to telecommunications outages, the FAA temporarily halted flights in and out of Nashville. "Intentional bombing" said local NewsChannel 5. "Some investigators are asking if there is a relationship between the Nashville bombing and the broader right-wing insurgent cause," terrorism analyst Laurie Mylroie wrote.

Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe told CNN that an explosion of this size would be investigated as a possible act of terrorism. He speculated that police might have been the target of the explosion because of the broadcast. A Nashville police hazardous devices unit was on the way to the site before the RV exploded. Bill Ryan, a retired detective and former member of the New York Police Department arson and explosions task force, told Fox News that the Nashville blast could be a "trial run" for a larger attack or "a standalone explosion."

The many threats to the telecommunications infrastructure, particularly 5G wireless technology, was the main hypothesis of FBI and homeland security analysts, given the conspiracy theories that had been voice connecting 5G to COVID. "The anti-5G movement is strong, and its meld with anti-vaxxers and MAGA supporters is sure to cause many headaches in the months and years ahead," a homeland security analyst told Newsweek at the time.

Responding to the explosion, the U.S. Park Police in Washington DC wrote in an internal briefing: "While the exact motive behind the bombing remains unknown, there have been some social media postings concerning conspiracy theories stating that election data stored at the AT&T building was targeted by the bomber. ... the 25 December bombing should act as a vivid reminder as to the despair and the dedication to act that exists from a small minority of individuals concerning recent social and political events."

"One more event in Nashville's 2020," Mayor Cooper said. Nobody wanted more bad news for Christmas, that terrorism might be accompanying the "recent social and political events." A new consensus was emerging that conspiracy believers, COVID deniers and pro-Trump forces were terrorists or potential terrorists, particularly when these broad groups were seen as a unified mass of gun-owning white supremacists. Enormous resources were devoted to investigating the Nashville bombing, with over 250 FBI agents on the scene by the weekend—a reminder that, after the fact, the FBI and other domestic agencies were very good at their job. Forensic tests of human remains recovered from the RV, as well as the VIN number of the mobile home, confirmed that Anthony Quinn Warner, 63, of Antioch, Tennessee, was the likely perpetrator. He had died in the explosion. The FBI would later say that Warner's actions "were determined to not be related to terrorism."

"Based on analysis of the information and evidence gathered throughout the investigation, the FBI assesses Warner's detonation of the improvised explosive device was an intentional act in an effort to end his own life, driven in part by a totality of life stressors—including paranoia, long-held individualized beliefs adopted from several eccentric conspiracy theories, and the loss of stabilizing anchors and deteriorating interpersonal relationships," the FBI said. "The FBI's analysis did not reveal indications of a broader ideological motive to use violence to bring about social or political change, nor does it reveal indications of a specific personal grievance focused on individuals or entities in and around the location of the explosion."

# Donald Trump's Base Took His Tweetstorm Seriously, Even If Nobody Else Did [54]

"Never give up. See everyone in D.C. on January 6th," Donald Trump started his particularly angry tweetstorm on December 26, the day after Christmas, from his West Palm Beach, Florida, home. The president let loose on every branch of government, from the FBI to the Supreme Court. "The U.S. Supreme Court has been totally incompetent and weak on the massive Election Fraud that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election. We have absolute PROOF, but they don't want to see it - No standing, they say. If we have corrupt elections, we have no country!" "The Justice Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest SCAM in our nation's history, despite overwhelming evidence," Trump said. "They should be ashamed. History will remember." "If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death," Trump tweeted. "Mitch & the Republicans do NOTHING, just want to let it pass. NO
FIGHT!"

"A young military man working in Afghanistan told me that elections in Afghanistan are far more secure and much better run than the USA's 2020 Election. Ours, with its millions and millions of corrupt Mail-In Ballots, was the election of a third world country. Fake President!" "Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency, like the Democrats would do if they had actually won. The proof is irrefutable! Massive late night mail-in ballot drops in swing states, stuffing the ballot boxes (on video), double voters, dead voters ... fake signatures, illegal immigrant voters, banned Republican vote watchers, MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS (check out Detroit & Philadelphia), and much more. The numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states, and cannot even be contested.... Courts are bad, the FBI and Justice didn't do their job, and the United States Election System looks like that of a third world country. Freedom of the press has been gone for a long time, it is Fake News, and now we have Big Tech (with Section 230) to deal with ... But when it is all over, and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Country's history, WE WILL WIN!!!"

Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), who announced after January 6 that he would not be running for reelection, responded to Trump's Saturday tweets, calling them a "temper tantrum and crazy conspiracies." Addressing Donald Trump, Kinzinger said he was "trying to burn the place down on the way out because you can't handle losing." Behind the scenes, Trump's army was getting ready. Kelly Meggs, who would later be arrested, wrote on Facebook: "We are all staying in DC near the Capitol we are at the Hilton garden inn but I think it's full. Dc is no guns. So mace and gas masks, some batons. If you have armor that's good."

"It better be a Trump victory party," another January 6 lawbreaker Corrine Lee Montoni posted on Facebook, to which a friend responded. "Or were going to fucking WAARRRRR party." "See you in DC on the 6th assholes who don't support Trump," posted Kenneth Reda, another participant who was arrested. The Proud Boys created an online crowdfunding campaign soliciting donations for "Protective gear and communications" to be used on January 6. One Proud Boys leader posted the following message on his Parler page: "Anyone looking to help us with safety/protective gear, or communications equipment it would be much appreciated, things have gotten more dangerous for us this past year, anything helps."

A leader of the Oath Keepers messaged instructions to "wait for the 6th when we are all in D.C. to insurrection."The Trump supporters, who called themselves insurrectionists and spoke openly about war, were still not taken seriously within the federal government and Congress. Meanwhile, the mainstream news media was oblivious. Politico said of Donald Trump's "See everyone in D.C. on January 6th" tweet that the president was "alluding to the date when some of his most ardent supporters in the House prepare to mount a long-shot challenge to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's win while Congress counts the Electoral College votes." In the House. The challenge was in the streets.

# Though Obsessed with Donald Trump, the Media Was Blind to Brewing Threat of Violence [56]

On December 27, the last Sunday of 2020, the news media struggled to offer any happy news in a year dominated by COVID and then by Donald Trump's post-election dissension.COVID cases reached 80 million worldwide and over the weekend, the United States reached a grim indicator: 1 in 1,000 Americans had died in the pandemic. Los Angeles County alone was experiencing one COVID death every ten minutes.
On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed concern that the state of the pandemic might get worse in the coming weeks. "... [T]he reason I'm concerned and my colleagues in public health are concerned also is that we very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year's, surge ... a surge upon a surge, because, if you look at the slope, the incline of cases that we have experienced as we have gone into the late fall and soon-to-be-early winter, it is really quite troubling." Then there was the Christmas morning bombing in Nashville, still raw in people's minds, a reminder that nothing stopped for the pandemic. Though terrorism was being downplayed, analysts latched onto other implications. "I think this is a wake-up call and a warning for all of us about how vulnerable our infrastructure is," former FBI assistant director Frank Figliuzzi told CBS' Face the Nation. "We've concentrated, post 9/11 on ... getting our hands around all the chemical companies, mass orders of precursors for known explosives," he said, calling on shop owners and companies to be even more vigilant.

"[T]he notion of a copycat seeing what's happened in Nashville and trying to do this themselves is very real," he said. "We haven't really been talking about infrastructure in this country in the context of individuals trying to conduct attacks of harm against," former homeland security Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Neumann told ABC's This Week, "but it's just a stark reminder that it is extremely vulnerable and we're overdue for some pretty significant investments."

On NBC's Meet the Press, there was no talk of Nashville, or COVID: the entire show was devoted to Joe Biden and what kind of president he would be. The closest the program got was in asking two governors about the difficult time and being targeted by COVID protestors. Gov. Mike Dewine of Ohio said: "I think it's understandable that people are upset. It's nine months into this. People are tired of it, so I get it."

Trump's "final days in office are shaping up to be the most volatile and unpredictable of a presidency defined by its volatility and unpredictability," said Jonathan Karl on ABC's This Week. ABC had Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan on, Karl asking him if he was concerned about the damage Donald Trump could do in his last 24 days in office. Hogan cited Trump's delay in signing the COVID stimulus bill into law, his vetoing of the defense authorization bill. "Millions of people are going to suffer," Hogan said. "The Paycheck Protection Plan ran out in July. Unemployment benefits are about to run out tomorrow. And we've got to get this done." Asked about Trump's call for a last-ditch fight on January 6, Hogan reassured viewers that Joe Biden was going to be sworn in on January 20. "There is a lot of disinformation out there," Hogan said. "Everybody wants every single legal vote to be counted. We want the election to be fair and proper."

"I'm hopeful that the vice president [Mike Pence] understands that [January 6 is a purely ceremonial job] and will execute his constitutional duties on January 6th," former Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie told ABC. "There may be some, some histrionics that go along with it, in the end I'm confident that the Congress will confirm what the American people did on Election Day, which was to elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States." Not one of the dominant Sunday morning news shows mentioned the protests brewing or the likelihood of violence. "See you in Washington, D.C., on January 6th. Don't miss it," Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday.

Capitol Riot Investigators Search for Donald Trump Smoking Gun [56]

When is a special event not special? When federal government bureaucrats get involved, parsing every letter of the word to conclude that special is normal. On December 28, House leaders met to discuss security for the upcoming January 6 Joint Session of Congress. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a member of the Congressional Democratic leadership, asked whether sufficient resources were being planned.

That day, the U.S. Park Police, the law enforcement entity responsible for the National Mall and the Ellipse, reported in an internal briefing that "hotel booking and reservation requests have shown a significant increase for 6 January through the immediate DC area," and they noted that "many members of the far-right group 'Proud Boys' plan on being in Washington on this date." "There is some concern that individuals may display more aggressive and desperate behavior as they interpret 6 January as their final opportunity to act on their grievances," the Park Police said. The U.S. Capitol Police also received tips that social media postings from Donald Trump supporters were saying that protestors were going to be armed, and that people were organizing. To "stock the Capitol" on January 6.

The FBI reported, in an eGuardian report of suspicious activity, that individuals were planning to engage in civil disobedience such as blocking major transportation routes leading into the District. There have been "multiple calls by individuals for attendees to participate in these events while armed," the FBI said. "Some social media posts have gone as far as to state that protestors outnumber law enforcement and that law enforcement would be easily overcome."

"Formal information coordination ... accelerated during the week of December 28," Jeffrey A. Rosen, former Acting United States Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, told Congress later. The FBI's Washington Field Office, he said, set up a regular command post to share information with the Capitol Police, federal law enforcement agencies, and local police organizations in order to coordinate among local and federal law enforcement.

The warning signs of arms and an assault on the Capitol were growing, and "information coordination" was beginning, but there was no formal mechanism with regard to who was in charge. The irony is that there is a specific federal government designation, called National Security Special Events (NSSE), that creates set procedures for a joint threat assessment, enhanced coordination, antiterrorism planning and restricted access. Used for gatherings of national significance, most are pre-designated: Republican and Democratic conventions, the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, presidential inaugurations and the State of the Union address.

The Government Accounting Office examined why the Joint Session of Congress was never designated an NSSE, and the explanations would be comic if they weren't quite so tragic. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the responsible federal organization overseeing NSSEs, told the GAO that "the non-permitted protest and subsequent attack on the Capitol would not meet the definition of a special event." It proceeded to blame every other government agency, including the District government, for not requesting such a designation.
- No governor requested that the event be so designated, the standard procedure, even though the DC mayor is not a governor.
- The designation of any special event requires "adequate time" in order for the Secret Service (the designated lead federal agency) to "effectively collaborate."
- The U.S. Capitol Police was the lead federal law enforcement agency and was responsible, not them.
- Though another federal agency could have made a request for a NSSE designation, no such request was made.
- Other 2020 pro-Trump rallies had not been designated.
-The NSSE designation "is a lengthy process and not something achieved in only a few days or weeks."
- Finally, homeland security said that public safety organizations could have adapted security postures "without the need to designate an event an NSSE."

When the GAO submitted a draft of their report to DHS, the department "non-concurred" on the recommendation that it needed to have a more flexible system to respond to dynamic circumstances. "These factors—context, current environment, and emerging threats—are evaluated when determining whether to designate an event as an NSSE," the department said, along with the excuses. It wasn't, in short, the Department's responsibility.

Then came the various rejoinders.
- The DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said they did not initiate a request because they did not think they had the authority to request an NSSE for an event on federal property.
- The Secret Service said the Joint Session did not normally meet the criteria for an NSSE designation "because it was considered routine congressional business, rather than a special event."
- The Park Police said the event was a "First Amendment demonstration."
- The Park Police said the permit holders did not state that they anticipated that the crowd at the Ellipse would move to another location.
- The Capitol police said they did not play any role in turning January 6 into an NSSE because they are part of the Legislative Branch and not the Executive and thought that DHS or another federal agency would initiate the request.

In other words: January 6, more important and threatening than any previous State of the Union address or political convention, was not "special," was not "national security," and indeed was not even an "event."

Moreover, there was a tangle jurisdictions and further bureaucratic impediments. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) was focused on President Donald Trump's security for his appearance at the Stop the Steal rally. And, after the attack, they were concerned about the safety of Vice President Mike Pence and the two other presidential successors—Nancy Pelosi and Charles Grassley. The Park Police was responsible for the Ellipse and the National Mall, not Capitol Hill. And, of course, the Department of Homeland Security was responsible for everything, and nothing. It was the worst of 9/11-like excuses. And yet Congressional inquiries a year later were still looking for a Donald Trump smoking gun rather than reforming the federal agencies that they actually have some control over.


# Dr. Anthony Fauci Understood COVID Science But Not the American People [57]

The COVID pandemic is "out of control," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Tuesday, December 29.The bad news, both in the United States and overseas, was relentless. In the U.S., the total number of cases was nearing 20 million as the winter surge continued. Some 340,000 American lives had so far been taken by the virus (it's 810,000 today) and the country was now exceeding 2,200 deaths per day.
That Tuesday, there were a reported 124,686 COVID-related hospitalizations, a record high since the pandemic began. Forty percent of all ICU beds nationwide were now occupied by COVID patients. Hospitalizations in Los Angeles County, the most populous in the U.S., were at an all-time high. Hospitals were now postponing non-urgent surgeries. And hospitals were also facing growing staffing shortages.

And if that weren't enough, the first known American case of a new, more contagious COVID variant, later known as Delta, was being reported in Colorado and California.

Meanwhile, the initial impressive roll-out of the COVID vaccines was hitting an obstacle. Operation Warp Speed had promised that 20 million doses of vaccine would be administered before January 1, but the rate of vaccination didn't match the promise. Only 2.5 million doses of 14 million doses distributed had been administered. The federal government blamed winter storms and power outages, and promised to do better. But everyone was quickly adjusting to setting up workable schemes for vaccinating, especially in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, which required special refrigeration.

And then came the partisan bickering. Dr. Atul Gawande, a member of the Biden-Harris Transition COVID Advisory Board, blamed problems with the roll-out on a lack of resources and little advance planning. President-elect Joe Biden, he said, would be "upfront about what the challenges are" and "transparent about where the bottlenecks are."

Biden, meanwhile, criticized the Trump administration's coronavirus response, saying the vaccination campaign was moving too slowly. "As I long feared and warned, the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should," Biden said. He also said that he was going to ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he took office. "Put aside this nonsense of making masks be a political statement or not," Fauci said on CNN, promising that if they did, the curve would come down.

Maybe Fauci was an expert on COVID, but not on the American people. Tens of millions of people were not wearing masks, put off by these us-versus-them statements, suspicious of government edicts, confused about COVID. Donald Trump contributed to this state, declining to wear a mask most of the time and offering his own fact-challenged theories about the pandemic. But the refusal was a deeper part of the American experience, an anti-government distrust enshrined in the very Constitution, not just in limiting powers of the executive but also in affirming the inherent right for citizens to bear arms.

It wasn't just about believing "the science": it was about believing the government and the scientists. "The pharmaceutical industry was making billions in profits," Steve, a Carlsbad, California member of the Proud Boys, told Newsweek. Steve, who is vaccinated, asked that his last name not be used because he feared reprisal. "We either live in a free country or we don't," Steve says. "I've heard all of the arguments that if we don't mask we are harming others. But what about everything that the federal government does, and the elite promotes, that harms others? At some point we need to have some basic accountability. That's just never going to happen within the two-party system." COVID flip-flops, capricious impositions like lockdowns, the destruction of small businesses, the mandatory mask mandates: all of them, Steve says, were and are a part of an "assault on liberty." Perhaps one of the clearest indicators of just how many Americans were increasingly fed up with COVID was in holiday travel. On December 29, the Transportation Security Administration said that it screened the highest daily total of airplane passengers since the start of the pandemic, weary citizens shrugging off Washington's pleas for people to forego visiting with or gather with their families.

# Exclusive: Secret Threat Report Named Everyone Except Angry Donald Trump Voters [58]

On December 30, just a week before January 6, the FBI, along with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center, issued an intelligence report—"Intelligence in Depth"—titled "Diverse DVE Landscape Probably Will Persist." DVE refers to domestic violent extremists.

The report, shared exclusively with Newsweek, did not mention the election or Donald Trump. No mention was made of the impact of COVID. No mention was made of the two post-election protests that had already taken place in Washington DC, on November 24 and December 12, or any upcoming threats. In fact, there was no focus on the nation's capital at all.

The report covered all bases but focused on none. It's a mishmash of contorted acronyms, codes to neutrally describe what the intelligence agencies saw as the threats on the American battlefield, but careful not to explicitly label any one group. White supremacists were referred to as Racially Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVE). There were also Anti-Government or Anti-Authority Violent Extremists (AGAAVEs), Anarchist Violent Extremists (AVEs), Militia Violent Extremists (MVEs), and Sovereign Citizen Violent Extremists (SCVEs). There were others mentioned, some with and without acronyms: Abortion-Related Violent Extremists, Animal Rights/Environmental Violent Extremists and Puerto Rican National Violent Extremists. The common linking characteristic in all of this was the term "extremist." Yet the December 30 report offered no explicit definition of what precisely was an extremist. Domestic Violent Extremists were described as "individual[s] based and operating primarily within the United States or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence."

A government definition of extremism is hard to come by. The definitive Department of Justice bible on the subject, "Investigating Terrorism and Criminal Extremism: Terms and Concepts," never—not in 120 pages—defines what extremism means. Nor does the new Department of Defense "Report on Countering Extremist Activity Within the Department of Defense," issued just this month. It merely says that members of the armed forces are restricted from participating in "extremist activities" that include "unlawful force, unlawful violence, or other illegal means to deprive individuals of their rights under the United States Constitution or the laws of the United States." The Pentagon says that this includes supporting "the overthrow of the government" and "goals that are political, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature." That's a fairly broad spectrum.

Few people would dispute that those who seek to further their political goals "through unlawful acts of force or violence" should be the subject of federal law enforcement attention, but without a definition of extremism, and with such a broad category of wildly different individuals and groups that fall under the domestic violent extremist umbrella, it is no wonder that the FBI had such a hard time paying attention to the many Americans who were openly threatening violence before January 6.

A senior retired FBI executive, who spoke to Newsweek on condition that his name not be used because he fears retaliation by the very extremists he is talking about, says that he sees two major constraints on the Bureau's domestic terrorism efforts. First, he says, there is too much emphasis on organized groups and searching for conspiracies—a legacy of the organized crime and then al Qaeda emphasis focusing on thwarting and dismantling groups.

Second, he says, the federal government has tied itself into a bind over the proper protocol of even following or monitoring free speech while looking for possible threats. The December 30 report, for example, was careful to note that not all extremists were prone to violence, stating that "First Amendment"-protected protest was not per se a predicate for either federal attention or further FBI investigation. "I understand that people might be skeptical that the FBI actually safeguards civil liberties, but in today's Bureau, it's more true than false," the FBI executive says. "Yes, there have been many historical examples of overreach, [but] this level of care is equally applied to right and left." The FBI stated in its 2021 domestic terrorism report to Congress: "Under FBI policy and federal law, no investigative activity may be based solely on First Amendment activity, or the apparent or actual race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity of the individual or group. The FBI does not investigate, collect, or maintain information on US persons solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment."

The executive says that post-January 6, with domestic terrorism a national issue and more emphasis on stopping attacks, previous constraints might loosen. But he still thinks that focusing on groups—Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, etc.—and imagining these groups are more powerful than they are, obscures the individuals and their actions that need to be detected and stopped.

Even after January 6, FBI Director Christopher Wray described the same vague threat picture as did the December 30 report in testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees. Despite all that had happened, he still saw homegrown violent extremists (HMVEs)—that is, "individuals radicalized here at home by jihadist ideologies espoused by foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda"—as the Bureau's number-one priority. HMVEs are not to be confused with DVEs, yet they are mixed together in a way that suggests the two are equivalent. HMVEs (foreign influenced) and DVEs (non-foreign influenced), FBI Director Wray said, have a commonality in that the biggest actual threat is from so-called "lone" wolves.

According to Wray, the Bureau is "countering lone domestic violent extremists radicalized by personalized grievances ranging from racial and ethnic bias to anti-government, anti-authority sentiment to conspiracy theories." Wray previously told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that, "over the last year, we observed activity that led us to assess there was potential for increased violent extremist activity at lawful protests taking place in communities across the United States."

The FBI says that in response to these threats, it authored 12 formal intelligence reports in 2020 relating to potential domestic terrorism. In 2019, the FBI produced 15 domestic terrorism related reports. (Each year, the FBI produces about 1,000 domestic terrorism related intelligence products.) In late August 2020, Wray says, the FBI published an analytical report "informing our partners that DVEs with partisan political grievances likely posed an increased threat related to the 2020 election.

"In that product, we noted that DVE responses to the election outcome might not occur until after the election and could be based on potential or anticipated policy changes," Wray said. In December 2020, he says, the FBI also contributed to a Department of Homeland Security Intelligence In-Depth product, which stated that the diverse DVE landscape "would probably persist due to enduring grievances." That would be obvious to any observer. The FBI, in its formal intelligence reporting, seems to have missed the signs completely.

"The FBI and our federal, state, and local partners collected and shared intelligence and relevant public safety-related information in preparation for the various planned events" on January 6, Wray claims. But there is no evidence that any of that sharing had any impact, according to the testimony of numerous U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department officials. Just this past September, Wray told Congress how much "the threat" had changed 20 years after the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. "It was 9/11, after all," he said, "that turned the FBI into an agency focused on disrupting threats." But when a national threat and a catastrophic event loomed in late 2020, FBI bureaucrats not only didn't disrupt it, they didn't even see it coming.

# Underestimating the Threat, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser Ordered Up Unarmed Guards [59]

On Thursday, December 31, says the current accepted narrative, the District of Columbia mayor rang an alarm about protests at the Joint Session of Congress. In fact, the opposite is true. What the mayor did, was ask for the minimal number of National Guardsmen and women to help out the Metropolitan Police Department, and she warned that those troops should be unarmed and not directly involve themselves in any protests. Mayor Muriel Bowser sent a letter on New Year's Eve to Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, requesting support on January 5 through 6. She said Guard personnel would support the MPD and the District Fire and Emergency Medical Services. "[N]o DCNG personnel shall be armed during this mission, and at no time, will DCNG personnel or assets be engaged in domestic surveillance, searches, or seizures of [U.S.] persons," she wrote.

A follow-up letter from Christopher Rodriguez, director of the District's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said that the DCNG's primary mission would be "crowd management and assistance with blocking vehicles at traffic posts [traffic control points or TCPs]." He specifically requested six National Guard crowd management teams at 30 TCPs and six specific Metro stations to prevent overcrowded platforms.

The reason for the limited request went back to June 1, 2020, when George Floyd protests reached their peak in the District, along with significant controversy about the role of the military. Former Attorney General Bill Barr characterized May 31 as "the most violent day of civil unrest in the District in 30 years."

Then Donald Trump took his famous walk through Lafayette Square to St. John's Episcopal Church, accompanied by then Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley was wearing a combat uniform. Esper and Milley would both later apologize for their presence, and their appearance of involving the military in partisan politics. But beyond the two defense leaders, there was also the question of the DC National Guard and the presence of active duty military troops. Guard troops were present at Lafayette Square and a Guard UH-72 helicopter hovered over protestors. Social media went bananas. "The optics of the past 72 hours are putting people inside the halls of the Pentagon on edge as images of U.S. troops on the streets of the nation's capital dominate airwaves across the globe," Politico wrote. The Pentagon would later pile on the public apologies and explanations but the damage was done.

Maj. Gen. Walker forwarded the request from the District of Columbia government to Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy on January 1 with his recommendation that McCarthy approve the supporting request. Because of a peculiarity of the District not being a state, the DC National Guard is under the direct command of the president, with the Secretary of the Army exercising direct control. Once inside the Pentagon, Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller also learned of the request the same day. Walker talked on the phone with McCarthy, explaining that Guard members helping the MPD with traffic and crowd control would free up more police officers to respond to any civil unrest. McCarthy told Walker to conduct a mission analysis, saying that he would confer with acting secretary Miller.

On December 31, the DC National Guard received its first law enforcement projections of the size of the crowd expected on January 6. The MPD estimated the crowd's size would be 19,925. The U.S. Park Police stated, according to the IG report, that "there was not a single organizer to control all the groups, so most action would be spontaneous. This was seen by some as a 'last chance' so there was the possibility of more aggression than in previous protests." There was an expectation that supporters of the Proud Boys and anti-fascist (Antifa) organizations would fight each other, resulting in possible larceny, looting and arson.

Still, the Army staff concluded that there was no emergency regarding possible protests because, as the IG report states, "local law enforcement had not recalled or placed their officers on standby." In a formal PowerPoint presentation prepared on December 31, Maj. Gen. Walker estimated that the mission required 350 DC National Guard personnel. The Pentagon later told the Inspector General that "there were no contingency plans for conducting CDOs [civil disturbance operations] in D.C. because the DoD acts only in response to specific requests from civil authorities unless the President invokes the Insurrection Act." That statement was false, as Newsweek previously reported. The DC National Guard started preparing for the "Operation Guardian" mission on January 1, conducting drills and table top war games, collecting the equipment and notifying Guardsmen and women of their activation for the anticipated mission. There were no credible threats of violence or civil unrest, the Operations Order stated.

On January 2, McCarthy met with Acting Secretary Miller and Gen. Milley to discuss the request. In that meeting, the leaders (including many other participants) discussed crowd estimates and rules of engagement. McCarthy argued that he wanted to ensure that the MPD was in the lead and that they exhausted all of their assets before turning to the military. If the Pentagon were to send further assistance, McCarthy wanted there to be proper command and control and appropriate authorities to provide further support. He said, and Miller and Milley evidently agreed, that they didn't want troops in full military combat gear or Army tactical vehicles close to the Capitol or have any deployment that looked like an overly militarized response.

In emails sent after the January 2 meeting, McCarthy reiterated that he was not inclined to provide support unless the District of Columbia government had exhausted all resources. Gen. Milley stressed the need for a lead Federal agency (normally the Secret Service) to make the requests and decisions—that the Department of Defense should be the last resort. The assistant secretary of defense for "homeland defense" wrote to the federal law enforcement agencies to see if they had any concerns that the Pentagon should be tracking. According to the IG report, "The [deleted, FBI Washington Field Office] responded that they had no specific concerns. The DHS [Department of Homeland Security] representative stated that they were not increasing their posture and were not tracking any threats to Federal facilities. The USMS [U.S. Marshal Service] representative stated that they were not responding to protests on January 5 and 6, 2021, and did not require DoD support."

Insurrectionist Chic Is a 'Serious Growth Sector,' Analysts Say [60]

On January 1, Thomas Edward Caldwell of Berryville, Virginia, started organizing a group of pro-Trump protestors to assault the Capitol. A former naval intelligence officer and federal government contractor with the DEA, he worked with out-of-towners to come to Washington for the big protest, arranging accommodations and making plans to bring firearms. "We're working on a Farm location ... Some are bringing long rifles," Caldwell wrote to one of his erstwhile soldiers on New Year's Day. Since the District of Columbia does not allow guns to cross into the District, Caldwell told his adherents that in addition to figuring out a place to stash rifles, he was planning on bringing a "sidearm" to the protests, one that could be more easily concealed.

"I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic," he wrote. He said he had done his duty while he was in the military but that now it was time to abandon peaceful protest and again come to the defense of the hallowed document. The election had "morphed into pure evil," he wrote. An unknown they was responsible for "blatantly rigging an election and paying off the political caste. We must smite them now and drive them down."

The FBI says that Caldwell also compiled a "death list" of targeted government officials, describing these alleged enemies of the Constitution as "cockroaches" and "maggots," saying that he would dispose of the traitors by "killing them, shooting them, and mutilating their corpses to use them as shields."

On January 1, Caldwell's band of dissenters awaited his instructions and his plan. One of those co-conspirators, the FBI says, is one Donovan Crowl, a 50-year-old former Marine from Ohio, who wrote on Facebook messenger: "Happy New year, to you Sir!! Guess I'll be seeing you soon. Will probably call you tomorrow ... mainly because ... I like to know wtf plan is. You are the man Commander."

Caldwell recommended an Arlington, Virginia, hotel for travelers. Surprisingly, they still had rooms available, he said, given the size of the crowd coming to Washington. He said other hotels were filling up because so many people were coming. He told Crowl that he was "setting up shop" there in the Ballston neighborhood, creating a "quick reaction force." He told Crowl that he would be doing "pre-strike" reconnaissance on the 5th.

"Maybe can do some night hunting," he said, referring to the earlier December 14 protest where pro-Trump protestors prowled the streets of Washington looking for members of Antifa and Black Lives Matter, attacking them.

The Arlington hotel "is a good location and would allow us to hunt at night if we wanted to," he wrote.

Caldwell also coordinated with a group of Oath Keeper friends from North Carolina, a group that he had hosted in November for the first post-election protest. They were taking a commercial bus to arrive early in the morning on the 6th. He told his troops that they would all be ready as hosts and as arms suppliers "in case things go bad and we need to get heavy," a military reference to escalating the fighting.

The FBI asserts that Crowell was one of the key leaders coordinating and planning an armed attack on the Capitol. The government indictment and statement of facts alleges that Caldwell used his military background to plan the attack in an "organized and practiced fashion"—including preparing possible snipers and contemplating stashing weapons on a pickup truck or a boat in the Potomac River, so that the quick reaction force could be armed if needed. Caldwell was charged after January 6 with counts of conspiracy, obstructing an official proceeding, trespassing, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting.

Caldwell's planning, and his leadership of "trained fighters," prosecutors say, went back as early as November. "I am already working on the next D.C. op," Caldwell wrote after the first post-election protest, projecting "real violence" in the future.

Caldwell's background, the FBI later charged, gave him the operational experience that he used "to the detriment of the citizens he at one time swore to serve." Prosecutors also allege that, prior to January 6, Caldwell also searched online for a "Surgical Steel Tomahawk Axe" and a concealed gun built to look like a cellphone.

During the riots itself, the FBI says, based upon Caldwell's seized phone, the ring leader received a message that "All members [of Congress] are in the tunnels under the capital."

"Seal them in turn on gas," it said.

In addition to being linked to the Oath Keepers, prosecutors allege that Caldwell was connected to Proud Boys, and that he boasted of a local Virginia group of Vietnamese-American Trump supporters who were also planning to be part of his army.

Caldwell, 66, and suffering from chronic back pain, never entered the Capitol on January 6, though the FBI alleges that he served as a "coach on the sidelines" for those who did, directing the riot.

That included Donovan Crowl, who showed up in a mish-mash military uniform, along with combat helmet, tactical vest, ballistic goggles and a handheld radio. On his sleeve was a patch identifying him as a member of the Oath Keepers. Crowl later said that he was also a member of the Ohio State Regular Militia. He was later photographed shouting "we're the first wave" inside the Capitol Rotunda.

Caldwell's attorney David Fischer countered government charges of conspiracy to cause violence. He said his client's "locker room" talk was merely "male bravado ... and didn't result in him committing one act of violence—on January 6th or before." Were Caldwell and Crowl armed insurrectionists or just play soldiers lost in a world of fantasy army? Both, says David Pedersen, Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of California San Diego. He points to the garb of the Capitol sackers as "aspirational and motivated": the protestors "want to be seen as" soldiers, as something honorable.

The prepper, survivalist and militia movements all have a "whole fashion component," says Pedersen, one that represents a set of norms and standards that already exists in society, "a grammar and a vocabulary" that is co-opted and inflected in their dress-up army. "It's a wish for recognition, to be heard, based on the notion that they are less heard than they want to be," Pedersen tells Newsweek.

Groups like Proud Boys and Oath Keepers have some of the same "qualities as Greek fraternities and street gangs ... masculinized social networks that offer a lot of material and social resources to their members." "They are support groups in a time when, at least for these guys, they feel that there aren't many others," Pedersen says. "The aggressiveness, the masculine qualities, the ritualized physicality, commitment to transcendent principles and ideals, the norm of loyalty, of lifelong membership, of brotherhood and connection, this sense of purpose."

The attack on the Capitol "is an insurrection because it's meant to say something significant. Their posted performances in front of their smart-phone cameras have as much meaning as a political speech does," Pedersen says. According to him, all insurrections are about saying something, producing meaning, not just destruction. "We have to figure out what they're saying, why they are saying it, and then how to peel them away from the more nefarious elite coalition that is essentially using them as foot-soldiers in an attempt to take and maintain control in the USA and elsewhere in the world.

"This rank-and-file is unhappy and has gripes that are worth hearing. We shouldn't just dismiss them as irrational crazies and deplorables to be locked up." Finally, Pedersen says the military dress itself is worthy of closer examination. According to him, analysts say that insurrectionist clothing—from MAGA hats to t-shirts, to military uniforms and accoutrements, and all of the aftermarket modifications—is a "serious growth sector .. touted as rapidly growing in contrast to the rest of the U.S. garment-fashion sector."

"It may or may not be a movement, but it certainly is a market," Pedersen says. A big part of doing what they are doing is shopping, choosing this garb as consciously as others who wear their own identifying uniforms. "It is not just a statement of militarism but also a statement—that from Hurricane Katrina through COVID—that society is precarious enough to leave people without basic needs, what they literally need to survive." "The way they dress, this larger language of patriotism, of societal protection, their allegiance to these ideals," is clinging to a language that everyone wants to own.

# Donald Trump Planned to Stoke Unrest, Call Out Troops, General Milley Feared [61]

One if by land, north side of Lincoln Memorial" on the Potomac river, Kelly Meggs posted on an encrypted Signal group chat on January 2, portentously referring to the famous Paul Revere ride from the American revolution. All during the day, organizers and protestors who would later be indicted for their roles on January 6 spoke of a quick reaction force (QRF) that would wait on the shore of the capital city ready to bring in weapons.

Meggs, 52, a Dunnellon, Florida, resident and self-described leader of the state chapter of the Oath Keepers, compared the storming of the Capitol building to the Boston Tea Party of 1773. On January 2, he posted a map of the city showing two water landings near the Lincoln Memorial and then further south near the tidal basin on Ohio Drive, labeling them QRF rally points where protestors might pick up their "long" guns.

Joshua James, another indicted protestor, received a message that same day asking about weapons. He advised an unindicted friend that it would be better to leave them home, that the "QRF will have weapons." Others—Derek Kinnison ("midnightrider"), Tony Martinez ("blue collar patriot"), Ronald Mele ("redline"), and Erik Scott Warner ("silvirsurfer")—discussed their own weapons plans. In a photograph taken on January 2, the four men posed, making a hand gesture associated with the Three Percenters, before getting in an SUV and driving cross country from Temecula, California, to the nation's capital. They called themselves the DC Brigade. Kinnison also posted an image of himself with a bandolier of shotgun ammunition around his body. "We will have lots of gear from medical kits, radios, multiple cans of bear spray, knives, flags, [armor] plates, goggles, helmets," he posted.

The Daily Beast reported that day that protesters were discussing bringing guns to the District, as well as breaking into federal buildings and attacking law enforcement. Fox News reported a social media declaration by Proud Boys Leader Enrique Tarrio that his organization would come to the Joint Session of Congress prepared for violence. The Metropolitan Police Department also issued a warning to the U.S. Capitol Police and the National Park Service that it had received information via its tip line that "there [were] detailed plans to storm federal buildings."

Oblivious, the new Acting District of Columbia Police Chief Robert J. Contee III met with Mayor Muriel Bowser. He recommended a curfew be declared for the night of January 6, anticipating the kind of violence that followed the earlier December protest—violence between pro- and anti-Trump forces that came after a day of peaceful protests. Bowser replied that she wanted to keep a curfew as an option but would wait to see how protestors behaved on the night of January 5 before deciding. Meanwhile Contee also spoke to Capitol Police chief Steven Sund, and the two agreed that there was no need to change any of their previous plans and arrangements made for the 6th. The Capitol Police thought it could handle the situation with the already assigned DC police.

Meetings were also held at the Pentagon to discuss the Mayor's request for D.C. National Guard support to alleviate the load of the MPD. In light of assurances that the Defense Department received from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security—that is, that they didn't have any specific concerns about the upcoming protests—there was no particular rush. A final decision on military support, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy told D.C. officials, would be coming on January 4, there being no emergency to move any quicker. The D.C. National Guard continued to plan for a 300 strong force—150 per shift—to be on the streets. There was also their own QRF of 40 men stationed at Andrews Air Force Base south of the Capitol in Maryland.

If law enforcement officials were all underplaying the possibilities for violence on January 6, Army Gen. Mark Milley was practically panicking. Milley had told his closest aides that he believed President Donald Trump was stoking unrest with the hope of using it as an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act, and thereby call out active duty military troops. Under the Act, those troops would then be relieved of the restrictions of Posse Comitatus, the Civil War-era law which limits the powers of the federal government to use military personnel to enforce the law. (One of the exceptions to Posse Comitatus is specifically when the president invokes the Insurrection Act.)

Milley told his closest colleagues that listening to the president was like reading George Orwell's "1984": "Lies are truth. Division is unity. Evil is good," he said, according to Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It." On the night of January 2, Milley was told that The Washington Post was going to publish an op-ed by all ten living former secretaries of defense warning Pentagon leaders that they should never allow the military to be used to settle election disputes or interrupt the peaceful transfer of power. The message was largely meant for Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, who was an unknown to the group now speaking out. No one knew for sure what his views were, nor whether he was working with the president and White House. (According to Miller's own account, as told to Jonathan Karl in "Betrayal," he was not.)

Starting after the New Year, Milley and his staff monitored their Dataminr accounts intensely, checking "several times a day" for any signs on social media of civil unrest or protest plans indicating violence. The private company ingests over 500 million public tweets daily looking for breaking news and early warnings, providing tip-offs. But given that Twitter had already started aggressively censoring users, almost every January 6 protestor had already moved to other social media platforms.

# Exclusive: Secret Commandos with Shoot-to-Kill Authority Were at the Capitol [62]:

On Sunday, January 3, the heads of a half-dozen elite government special operations teams met in Quantico, Virginia, to go over potential threats, contingencies, and plans for the upcoming Joint Session of Congress. The meeting, and the subsequent deployment of these shadowy commandos on January 6, has never before been revealed. Right after the New Year, Jeffrey A. Rosen, the acting Attorney General on January 6, approved implementation of long-standing contingency plans dealing with the most extreme possibilities: an attack on President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, a terrorist attack involving a weapon of mass destruction, and a declaration of measures to implement continuity of government, requiring protection and movement of presidential successors.

Rosen made a unilateral decision to take the preparatory steps to deploy Justice Department and so-called "national" forces. There was no formal request from the U.S. Capitol Police, the Secret Service, or the Metropolitan Police Department—in fact, no external request from any agency. The leadership in Justice and the FBI anticipated the worst and decided to act independently, the special operations forces lurking behind the scenes.

"I believe that DOJ [Department of Justice] reasonably prepared for contingencies ahead of January 6, understanding that there was considerable uncertainty as to how many people would arrive, who those people would be, and precisely what purposes they would pursue," Rosen later told Congress. He stressed that his department "no frontline role with respect to crowd control," that they were focused on "high-risk" operations.

The contingency units meeting on January 3 included the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, the FBI's national "Render Safe" team, an FBI SWAT team from the Baltimore Field Office, Special Response Teams from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Marshals Service Special Operations Group. All of these assets were "pre-deployed" and ready to go over the weekend of January 2-3, staging out of the FBI Academy complex in Quantico, 30 miles south of the Capitol building. If a WMD or terrorist attack occurred, the units were to move via helicopter to the site of the incident. The activation of the catastrophic response units, operating under plans already approved by President Trump, entailed an automatic green light allowing federal responders to take the initiative and spare no resources, including shoot-to-kill authority, to deal with this most extraordinary condition.

The 350-strong Hostage Rescue Team was established in 1983 to be a national level counterterrorist unit, offering a "tactical" option—a military option—for the most extraordinary law enforcement situations within the United States. Prior to 9/11, HRT was primarily a domestic counter-terrorism unit; after the attack, the team took on additional missions, including working with the Joint Special Operations Command overseas in high-profile raids and the targeting of high-value targets.

The FBI is the lead agency for what insiders call the "no-fail, 24-hour, 7-day-a-week, 365-day-per-year response capability." In 1999, the Bureau was assigned the responsibility for the render safe mission, a euphemism for extraordinary and highly classified actions that are slated to take place in cases of a lost, stolen, or hidden nuclear or radiological weapon. The FBI had already been given primary responsibility for domestic counterterrorism, including quasi-military action against armed groups inside the United States. President Bill Clinton approved new rules that assigned "national response" to the FBI (it had previously resided in the Defense Department). The FBI would form the dedicated rapid response force, and technical response assets from various departments would be seconded to this so-called National Mission Force, operating under a National Asset Commander, an FBI officer appointed by and reporting to the Attorney General and ultimately the White House.

In April 2005, the FBI consolidated its various extraordinary response teams under the National Asset Response Unit (NARU), responsible for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The dedicated rapid response force, ready to deploy anywhere in the United States within two hours of notification, reached operational readiness during the Obama administration, with dedicated national response elements from the Department of Energy and augmentation from the military's Joint Special Operations Command. The overlap of counterterrorism and WMD forged this extraordinary force, operating under Top Secret and compartmentalized presidential directives. The National Mission Force, however, also had to plan for other crisis response contingencies, such as hostage rescue and continuity of government. Those latter functions could also fall under the operational control of the Secret Service (an element of the Department of Homeland Security) or to military commanders who were operating in response to immediate emergencies.

Most of the literature mistakenly says that the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)—including, famously, the units formerly known as Delta Force and SEAL Team 6—is the primary national mission force. Although overseas, the National Mission Force often operates as a Joint Special Operations Task Force (with FBI augmentation), made up of dedicated teams assigned to JSOC, inside the United States, the FBI is in charge.

On the morning of January 6, most of these forces staged closer to downtown Washington, particularly after intelligence was received indicating a possible threat to FBI headquarters building or the FBI's Washington Field Office. FBI tactical teams arrived on Capitol Hill early in the day to assist in the collection of evidence at sites—including the Republican and Democratic party national headquarters—where explosive devices were found. FBI SWAT teams and snipers were deployed to secure nearby congressional office buildings. Other FBI agents provided selective security around the U.S. Capitol and protection to congressional members and staff.

A tactical team of the Hostage Rescue Team was one of the first external federal agencies to actually enter the Capitol after protestors breached the building. In addition to augmentation of emergency security assets, one team coordinated with the U.S. Capitol Police and Secret Service to provide additional safeguarding of Vice President Pence, who had been moved to the underground parking structure beneath the Capitol, from where he was supposed to evacuate. But Pence refused to leave the building and stayed underground instead.

The presence of these extraordinary forces under the control of the Attorney General—and mostly operating under contingency plans that Congress and the U.S. Capitol Police were not privy to—added an additional layer of highly armed responders. The role that the military played in this highly classified operation is still unknown, though FBI sources tell Newsweek that military operators seconded to the FBI, and those on alert as part of the National Mission Force, were present in the metropolitan area. The lingering question is: What was it that the Justice Department saw that provoked it to see January 6 as an extraordinary event, something that the other agencies evidently missed.

# Exclusive: Secret Service Intel Saw 'No Indication of Civil Disobedience' [63]

On January 4, five days after the request, acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller approved the use of the D.C. National Guard in support of law enforcement in protection of the Capitol for the upcoming Joint Session of Congress, two days away. But a closer look at what Miller approved reveals how much the National Guard is a false issue, hiding the much larger question of the failure of the intelligence community to anticipate what would happen. That reality was underlined a week ago, when the Pentagon announced that the rules were changing regarding use of the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG), putting more authority in the hands of the Secretary, a move that the Defense Department said was intended to make the military more prepared to respond to incidents in the D.C. area.

The Pentagon—and by inference, the Donald Trump-appointed leadership—has been accused of slow-walking the urgent request for assistance on January 6 that came from the Capitol Police and the D.C. government. But the change was a streamlining that in reality changes nothing with regard to what really happened at the U.S. Capitol. There were never any Guardsmen or women ready or able to respond.

January 4 was a day of urgent meetings. At 9:00 a.m., Miller met with Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, and other senior DOD leaders to discuss the D.C. National Guard role. Secretary McCarthy had submitted a letter with his recommendation to approve the "request for assistance," including many caveats for any military troops to be actively involved: There had to be a civil "lead federal agency" (in reality, either the Secret Service or the FBI) to coordinate the actions of all entities involved; and the demonstrations had to overwhelm to local and federal law enforcement agencies. McCarthy said that the D.C. National Guard was also not authorized to perform any tasks other than those authorized in his latter, specifically any armed tasks. Miller orally concurred with McCarthy's recommendations; written confirmation to follow.

Kenneth P. Rapuano, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security, then met with his staff, directing them to draft Miller's approval. The staff met. McCarthy also met with the Army General Counsel to get concurrence. Then he had conversations with members of Congress, who stressed that they wanted National Guard members to prominently identify themselves, and they discussed whether soldiers would carry weapons.

At 10:45 a.m., McCarthy spoke to Metropolitan Police Department acting Chief Robert J. Contee III, telling him that the DCNG would fulfill their request. McCarthy said that the Guard would mobilize a total of 340 personnel, all unarmed, with no one posted east of 9th Street (approximately a half-mile west of Capitol Hill. No mission change could take place without his approval. There were other meetings and events during the day: at 11:00, 12:42, 2:11, 2:28, and 2:41.

Across the Potomac, a "Task Force Guardian" commander was activated at the D.C. Armory to command the deploying units. He would report to the commander of something called the Joint Task Force District of Columbia and then to the head of the DCNG, Maj. Gen. William Walker. At 4:41 p.m., Walker's office emailed an updated plan to subordinate officers and Army officials. At 5:00 p.m., Miller, Milley, McCarthy, and Walker met via teleconference with other agency officials (including the Attorney General) to go over threats, jurisdictions, and responses.

The FBI, according to Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker's "I Alone Can Fix It" "had no credible reports of dangerous threats ... The FBI flagged in a briefing later that afternoon that agents had seen an increase in violent rhetoric on social media ... but there was nothing specific they could act on." The Department of Homeland Security, the attendees were told, had not issued an elevated or imminent alert.

The Secret Service reported that the hashtags #WeAreTheStorm, #1776Rebel, and #OccupyCapitol were gaining traction, that Trump supporters were proposing to occupy Capitol Hill. According to the "Protective Intelligence Brief, March for Trump, January 4, 2021", exclusively obtained by Newsweek, the Secret Service pointed to a video by "Stop the Steal" inventor Ali Alexander urging individuals to bringing tents, food, sleeping bags and water.

"No organization efforts for events on January 6, 2021, have been identified on the dark web at this time," the Secret Service intelligence component wrote. The report listed at least 57 different groups are coming to Washington, including counter-demonstrators from 13 groups. The Secret Service concluded that there was "no indication of civil disobedience."

In the afternoon, a multi-agency teleconference was also hosted by the D.C. Police, and included the FBI, the Secret Service, the Park Police, Supreme Court Police, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and DC Fire & Emergency Medical Services. They discussed the first of three Daily Intelligence Reports from the Capitol Police. The report said that the probability of acts of civil disobedience was on a continuum from "Remote" to "Improbable."

"It [is] possible the Million Magi [sic] March folks could organize a demonstration on USCP grounds," the report said.

"We continue to monitor and investigate social media statements forecasting non-specific acts of violence in the District associated with events scheduled for 6 January 2021," the U.S. Park Police said in another intelligence report. It said that there was "the probability of sporadic violent actions ... if opposing groups are allowed to come into physical contact with each other."

But the report also said the Park Police had "no indication of any acts of violence being pre-planned by any specific individual(s) or groups."

At 5:30, Maj. Gen. Walker briefed Secretary McCarthy on his final plans for the DCNG. McCarthy told Miller that only he could authorize the deployment of a rapid reaction force. At 5:45, acting Secretary Miller spoke to acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen about the Justice Department taking over as the lead federal agency. They also discussed other highly classified matters regarding the "National Mission Force" assignments.

So: a lot of back-and-forth and meetings to prepare the military response, and yet the numbers were tiny, given the situation. The DCNG would provide a total 340 personnel, and that group would consist of a 20-person command element, two shifts providing loose "crowd control" at Metro stations and traffic control points, a 25-person "Civil Support Team" of hazardous device and weapons of mass destruction specialists, and a 40-person rapid reaction force.

In other words, on January 6 itself, a total of some 130 soldiers would be available during each 12-hour shift. As for the rapid reaction force, of the 40 Air National Guard personnel, 18 were helicopter pilots and aircrew and maintenance technicians required to move the force from Andrews air force base to the Capitol. Another eight were administrators. That left 16 security forces members—airmen with law enforcement who had previous experience with civil unrest.

So for all the talk of accelerating the National Guard's arrival at the Capitol, on the afternoon of January 6 some 130 soldiers, none of them armed, dispersed to more than two dozen locations, would have had to have been collected together and moved to the Capitol. If the rapid reaction force was called from Maryland, another 16 uniformed personnel would join them. This is all that was available quickly from the D.C. National Guard. The decision-making on the 6th might have been sluggish and even passive-aggressive, but in the end, it was only about 146 additional bodies to hold the line.

# 'Cops Are the Primary Threat,' Warned the Proud Boys' Encrypted Messaging Channel [64]

On January 5, President Donald Trump announced definitively that he would speak during the "Save America" rally on the Ellipse on the south side of the White House. Though the Secret Service had been mapping out his possible participation for days, and Trump had indicated (and people assumed) that he would attend, given all his "see you there" exhortations, this was the first confirmation. The president told organizers that he wanted to be joined on the dais by members of his family, campaign loyalists, and members of Congress. The National Park Service increased the crowd estimate on the Ellipse rally permit to 30,000—up from the original 5,000 earlier anticipated.

In the competition to capitalize on the pro-Trump and election-refusal energies, several events related to overturning the election took place in or around the National Mall on the 5th. The so-called Eighty Percent Coalition organized a "Rally to Revival," which was permitted to take place at Freedom Plaza. "I don't know how all this is going to end but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one," Alex Jones bellowed at the event.

A "Save the Republic Rally" was organized by Moms for America across from the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. A "One Nation Under God" rally near the Supreme Court was organized by Virginia Women for Trump, Stop the Steal, American Phoenix Project and Jericho March. At the rally, Russell Taylor spoke: "I am a free American. And I stand here in the streets with you in defiance of a communist coup that is set to take over America. ... We are free Americans and in these streets, we will fight and we will bleed before we allow our freedom to be taken from us. We declare that we will never bend a knee to the Marxists within Antifa, to the tyrannical Democrat governors who are puppets, and to the deep state commie actors who threaten to destroy America." Taylor was later arrested for his role on January 6.

All during the day, a number of individuals who would later be arrested built the pieces of the Quick Reaction Force forming at the Comfort Inn Ballston hotel in Arlington, Virginia. Corinne Lee Montoni posted to her Parler account, "DC bound see ya there Revolutionists!" Mononi was later arrested for her role on January 6.

Several open chat rooms on 4chan, posts on Twitter (from an account connected to "Super Happy Fun America") and the website theDonald.win, all publicly accessible, had dozens of posts from would be protestors saying they planned to storm the Capitol and force an evacuation as the Joint Session voted to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the Electoral College. "January 6—Washington, DC—It begins," Mark Sahady posted. He would later be arrested for his role at the Capitol.

"I think it's game over for Trump," Samuel J. Fisher posted. "The swamp and pedophiles in Hollywood are immortal ... If millions of patriots don't show up with guns ... It could be over." Fisher was later arrested for his role at the Capitol. The Oath Keepers website was also clear, encouraging its members and affiliates to go to Washington. One article said: "It is CRITICAL that all patriots who can be in DC get to DC to stand tall in support of President Trump's fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup, through the massive vote fraud and related attacks on our Republic. We Oath Keepers are both honor-bound and eager to be there in strength to do our part."

"As we have done on all recent DC Ops, we will also have well-armed and equipped QRF teams on standby, outside DC, in the event of a worst case scenario," the article continued. The team would move with their weapons, he said, "where the President calls us up as part of the militia to assist him inside DC. ... We stand ready if he does (and we also stand ready to answer the call to serve as militia anytime in the future, and anywhere in our nation, if he does invoke the Insurrection Act)." At 7:40 p.m., someone wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and a COVID mask was filmed carrying a bag on South Capitol Street. At 7:52 p.m., the individual was recorded sitting on a bench outside the Democratic National Committee. At 8:14 p.m., the same person was filmed in an alley near the Republican National Committee. Police say the individual left pipe bombs at both locations. The person is still at large.

The previous day, Proud Boys Chairman of the Board Enrique Tarrio was arrested by D.C. Police as he was entering the city from Virginia. Tarrio had been banned from entering the District of Columbia after the December 12 rally and there was a warrant out for his arrest. Tarrio was charged with one charge of destruction of property on December 12 and two felony counts of possession of high-capacity magazines for rifles.

"Let them remember the day they decided to make war with us," Tarrio posted on Parler. On January 5, the Proud Boys set up a new encrypted messaging channel, assuming that Tarrio's phone would compromise their existing communications. The channel, named "Boots on the Ground," had 60 users, according to the FBI. Between 8:28 and 9:09 p.m., messages were posted reminding everyone to meet at the Washington Monument not later than 10 a.m. the next day. Members were told not to wear Proud Boys "colors," the organization's traditional black and yellow.

"Cops are the primary threat, don't get caught by them or BLM [Black Lives Matter], another post said. "It is apparent now more than ever, that if you are a patriot, you will be targeted and they will come after you, funny thing is that they don't realize is, is we are coming for them."

At the Capitol, a virtual interagency meeting was convened between the U.S. Capitol Police, the three-member Capitol Police Board (responsible for overseeing the police) and a dozen top law enforcement and military officials including the FBI, the Secret Service, Metropolitan Police Department, the Park Police, the National Guard and the Military District of Washington. Former Chief of Police Steven A. Sund testified later before Congress: "During the meeting, no entity, including the FBI, provided any intelligence indicating that there would be a coordinated violent attack on the United States Capitol by thousands of well- equipped armed insurrectionists. At no time did the Department of Homeland Security issue a threat advisory bulletin in reference to violent extremists planning a coordinated, violent attack on the U.S. Capitol." Paul D. Irving, former House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms and a member of the Police Board testified: "On January 5, Chief Sund and I participated in a web-based interagency conference call ... Based on the intelligence and threat assessment, everyone on the call believed that we were prepared and the plan met the threat."

The FBI did take the added step, at the 11th hour, of setting up a national coordination center at headquarters, especially to facilitating better coordination and sharing of information with the Pentagon, homeland security and the Department of the Interior (which oversees the Park Police). The FBI's main concern was a terrorist attack or the use of a weapon of mass destruction. The Secret Service also put the finishing touches on contingency plans guarding against potential drone attacks, as well as emergency response in case of chemical attacks.

On the evening of January 5, the FBI received a report of a potential air threat by a small plane. According to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa's "Peril," Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley and Secretary of Defense Chris Miller ordered a Noble Eagle "exercise," with increased readiness and practice runs of F-16 fighters over Washington. As previously reported by Newsweek, the planning for a catastrophic event, and not the obvious one, became the focus of everyone's attention.

During the day, hotels in and around Washington filled up, thousands attended the various January 5 rallies, and protestors prepared for January 6. As midnight approached, police clashed with Proud Boys and militia members who were roaming the downtown streets. At least ten people were arrested on assault and concealed weapons charges. "Last night was relatively peaceful with [four] arrests for possession of weapons ... around Freedom Plaza and disorderly [conduct] around BLM [Black Lives Matter] plaza," the Federal Protective Service (FPS), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, reported. In its Information Bulletin 11-1B-001-2021, "First Amendment Protected Activities with the National Capital Region, January 5, 2021," the FPS stated that "Domestic extremists to include anarchist extremists, anti-government extremists (AGE), and racially motivated violent extremists (RMVE) will likely participate in First Amendment protected activities and use the activities as an opportunity to promote their ideologies and motivate followers to promote violence.

"Americans have constitutionally protected rights to assemble, speak, and petition the government," the federal agency reported. "FPS safeguards these rights and only reports on First Amendment protected activities for situational awareness and operational planning to assure the safety and security of the participants, public, federal assets, missions, facilities and occupants." The Park Police, in its "Daily Operational Snapshot," concluded that the "Events of 5 January concluded without any significant incidents or issues. A total of four firearms were recovered by law enforcement resulting in several arrests.  "Our greatest concern remains the lone offender, working alone or in a very small group determined to act out violently to fulfill or correct what they perceive to be justified grievances or wrongs imposed on themselves or society." "Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office," Donald Trump tweeted. "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

# Donald Trump Didn't Run the January 6 Riot. So Why Did It Happen? [65]

On the first anniversary of January 6, there is so much we still do not know: about the direct role of Donald Trump, about any link that actually existed between the Trump camp and the protestors, about the intelligence agencies and what they really knew, about the labyrinth of federal agencies and their inadequate response, and finally, about the size of the crowd and the protestors themselves. Why were some 120,000 people there in Washington in the first place? What did they think they were going to achieve? The House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol continues its methodical investigation, and there have now been a half-dozen commissions and reports laying out timelines and testimony. But none of these central questions has been answered. Other than the heads of security for Congress and the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police resigning in shame, no one else in government has been held accountable. Not one institution has had to pay a price for failing to do its job. In fact, the opposite is true: Congress has rushed to give the national and homeland security agencies more money.

January 6 is still an open wound in American society, and much of the hurt and confusion hinges on the question of whether it was a demonstration, a riot, or an insurrection. The simple answer is that it was all three. It was a demonstration because, of all those who were there, only some 750 have been arrested, most charged with obstruction of Congress, trespassing and disorderly conduct. It was a riot because thousands forcibly disregarded police lines and violently surrounded the Capitol building. It was an insurrection because hundreds came armed, with everything from guns to pepper spray—before Donald Trump said anything—prepared to assault the Capitol and attack the government of the United States.

The federal agencies now insist on labeling what happened as an organized and coordinated attack, dismissing those who were protesting while also affirming their own failure to detect and anticipate such an attack. But the facts seem to indicate that as few as one percent of the people who were there fit the label of insurrectionist. While there has been much attention on the presence of a few hundred Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and other militia members, more than half of those arrested are unaffiliated with any group. In other words, this was an organic protest, arising from a larger movement.

Which brings us to Donald Trump. He spent two months railing about a stolen election, sowing an enormous amount of discord and spurring on so many. And then on the day itself, he called for the crowd to march on the Capitol. But did he have some secret relationship with the insurrectionists? And was the Trump camp in contact with the leaders or exerting any control? The facts so far, despite many breathless stories about conversations, texts and secret meetings, indicate that the answer is no. The president's behavior was abhorrent and perhaps even criminal, but there is no smoking gun to find.

The president spent four years promoting the Donald Trump Show, railing against Washington, the federal government, the news media, and anyone who didn't agree with him. The effect was to widen the chasm in American society and to harden his most fervent fellow travelers, affirming their view that the system was rigged against their champion and them, and that nothing in the mainstream (in the news, in officialdom, or even in science) could be believed. Yes, there were and are extremists, but the vast majority, representing the 70 million who voted for Trump, were and are making a very loud statement that they agree with the Trump doctrine of contempt for the system and the current order.

In the course of this Newsweek investigation into the road to January 6, dozens of protestors who were there have been interviewed. It's hard to articulate a specific political outlook or worldview of this disparate group (mostly because there doesn't seem to be one), but one thing is clear: They are unhappy with everything from COVID rules to what they perceive to be an unfair persecution of their president and of them..

Therein lies the danger of so much focus on Donald Trump. As in the impact of two impeachments, his messianic standing is merely enhanced. The failure to find a smoking gun in the future will strengthen and empower his followers. And the act of not holding any institutions accountable will be to affirm to so many that even partisan Washington—the mainstream—cares only about preserving its own rule. If no attention is paid to the central questions that still linger, the January 6 investigations will exacerbate the very conditions in American society that led to the riots.

Of course Donald Trump did nothing. He watched television all day, forced out of his cocoon once in the afternoon, after it was too late, to record an ineffectual video message asking those who were already rioting to stand down. But he was a president who never governed, who only tweeted, who followed his own mercurial instincts no matter what. Donald Trump did not have a plan for January 6; he never did. And although he communicated with friends and some allies in Congress (and with a bunch of his media shills), it was all too late for him to exert any influence once the riots began. President Trump never spoke to the Attorney General or the FBI director, never spoke to his Secretary of Defense or his own National Security Advisor. In fact, Robert O'Brien was in Florida that day and his acting Secretary of Homeland Security was in the Middle East. As this Newsweek series makes clear, those national and homeland security agencies have manufactured every excuse possible as to why they didn't connect the dots and why they failed to prevent the attack. None of them, and no one in the sprawling patchwork of law enforcement, can rightly claim any award for their performance. In fact, the only heroes of January 6 were the front line officers who actually battled the protestors and rioters.

Of the police who were actually fighting, some 210 were injured. It's still hard to tell how many law enforcement personnel were actually at the Capitol at 2:00 p.m., when the rioters started entering the building, but of some 2,000 U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department officers who were on duty, about half (approximately 500 USCP and 550 MPD officers) engaged the crowds. In other words, half of the "available" officers did all of the work. But of them, 20 percent were injured.

No one of any importance from any other agency was ever at the Capitol to physically defend the building or to subsequently evacuate it. Other federal law enforcement officers—500 who showed up from the Department of Justice (FBI and ATF officers and U.S. Marshals), 50 from homeland security agencies and 150 D.C. National Guard personnel (who began helping outside the Capitol at 6:00 p.m.)—arrived at the 11th hour and never took part in the actual defense of the Capitol or the clearing of the building.

In the three weeks after January 6, 38 Capitol Police and 80 D.C. police present at the Capitol tested positive for COVID.

There were no mass arrests on January 6. By 9:00 p.m. in the evening, 52 people had been arrested to acts related to the riot (26 of them on Capitol grounds). No firearms were confiscated from the rioters at the Capitol. Four arrests were later made by MPD officers of individuals carrying pistols without a license.

In the course of the year-long investigation by the FBI, thousands of individuals have been interviewed, and hundreds of thousands of phone calls, text messages, social media postings and other documents have been collected. The FBI has also collected and is reviewing nearly 14,000 hours of video—from the news media, from surveillance cameras, from body cameras, from defendants phones, from social media and from informants.

So far, some 720 arrests have been made (the FBI says if could eventually charge as many as 2,500 people). Some 225 have been accused of crimes against law enforcement. As of the first of this year, some 160 defendants have plead guilty to one or more charges. Some 80 have been sentenced. No one has been charged with insurrection or sedition. No defendants have gone to trial.
