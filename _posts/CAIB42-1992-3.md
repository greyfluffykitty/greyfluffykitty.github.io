## Editorial: The Value of Values

In these pre-election days, "family values" are smog-ging the political atmosphere with mindnumbing visions of perfect White, suburban households. Both parties have Willie Hortonized the non-issue and put their wives and children on display, proving, not that they have family values, but only that they have wives and children. The exploitation at the conventions stank. Albert Gore portrayed himself as a great humanitarian because he sat long hours by his severely injured child's bedside. What a father! The Republicans, fresh from evis-cerating civil rights legislation, featured an effusive speech by the grandchild George Bush once referred to as the "little brown one."

Meanwhile, real families (13.1 percent live in poverty, 33 percent are female-headed), communities (with crum-bling infrastructures and dwindling federal aid), and in-dividuals (increasingly homeless and unemployed) are in real crisis. The cause is not lack of family values and the effect is not moral decay. The complex causes include an economic crisis rivaling the depression of the 1930s; a profound shortage of basic social services such as health and child care; a poisoned environment; and a lack of jobs, job security, and fairly paid, meaningful work. The most obvious effect is the impoverishment of the great majority to benefit the rich—a dynamic played out not only domestically, but enforced on an international level by U.S. policy against the Third World.

While the Republicans and Democrats alike prattle on about family values, they ignore systematic violation of democratic values and ethical standards. The August mistrial of CIA operations boss Clair George, charged with nine felony counts, was a particularly dramatic ren-dition of this dirge for democracy. Prosecution witness Alan Fiers wept on the stand because he had to choose between betraying the Agency he loved and covering his butt; George self-righteously wrapped himself in patriotism and stonewalled. Both men, with a precision and irrelevance worthy of medieval theologians, split hairs on the differences among not telling the truth, pur-posely omitting crucial information, implying falsehood, and actually lying. Neither man lamented a far more serious crime than lying to Congress: secretly implement-ing—along with Bush, North, Casey, and the whole rot-ten gang—the murderous Iran-Contra policy in violation of domestic and international law.

And why should they? The Congress, backed up by the courts, supports the basic premise of covert opera-tions and does little more than occasionally readjust its blinders. The brave few who effectively oppose the clandestine institutions and call for meaningful reform are routinely punished. Frank Church's re-election was targeted and he was defeated. Otis Pike received a phone call from the CIA threatening, "We will destroy you." Most recently, Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.) is being harassed over his Iraqgate investigations, and ex-CIA of-ficer and outspoken Agency critic Philip Agee has been assailed in a series of defamatory articles. The assault weapons in these attacks are disinformation, dirty tricks, and questionable intelligence "leaks."

Fear of repercussions, however, is not what keeps Bush or Clinton from calling for a more democratic political system—one in which agencies such as the CIA could not annex vast powers. Bush, a former head of the CIA is a Company man down to his school tie, and Clin-ton, an opportunistic political animal is little better. No wonder then, that the electorate—so desperate for change it considered a harebrained billionaire—see little difference and less hope. The people, no fools they, con-tinue to express their faith in the system by staying home in droves on election day. Nor do they seem to be hoodwinked by the bipartisan family values barrage.

So, how about throwing a different set of values into the campaign hopper: open government and democratic process. There is a fundamental contradiction between democracy and secrecy in government. A political sys-tem of, by, and for the people can only work with a fully informed public; the CIA and its ilk can only work under the clandestine cloak. Lying to the people—any way you choose to define or disguise it—is the job of in-telligence agencies. Concealed in a bureaucratic maze, and armed with delusional ideological and moral jus-tifications, the CIA is an unchecked an unbalanced in-stitution.

It's time to relegate it to a small information gathering service and spend the billions saved on human needs.

## Tracking Covert Actions into the Future

**By Philip Agee**

Over May Day weekend I was one of several thousand people attending an international solidarity conference in Brussels organized by the Belgian Labor Party. Among the participants were representatives of progressive and revolu-tionary parties and movements from around the world. The atmosphere was a refreshing reminder that the ideal of socialism, and resistance to exploitation and oppression, are very much alive.

My role was to outline U.S. efforts during the Cold War—mainly through the CIA—to suppress Third World national liberation movements. Additionally, I was asked to speculate on what these movements could expect from the U.S. under the Bush-proclaimed New World Order. Inevitably, questions arose about the much televised burning of Los Angeles. Would it affect Bush in the November elections? Could it be only the beginning? Was it another sign of overall U.S. decline?

Los Angeles, I suggested, was the result of the U.S. system working exactly as it is supposed to—the failure being not the existence of poverty, rage, and despair, but the momen-tary inability of the dominant class and culture to dissuade or distract the "underclass" from taking mass action. The Rod-ney King beating verdict simply lifted the lid.

The events in L.A. and other cities underlined the domes-tic system that produces, and is in turn affected by, U.S. foreign policy, including CIA activities. They were also a vivid reminder that the 1990s is a period of transition, with enormous opportunities for change in national priorities—a potential not seen since the late 1940s. The possibilities for positive change in those post-World War II years, not over-whelming to be sure, disappeared when Truman and his team decided in 1950 to start a permanent war economy in the United States. The reason? The U.S. economy, in its tradi-tional trickle-down structure, needed militarism at home and abroad to generate jobs and exports to avoid a return to the 1930s conditions of depression—toward which the economy was then feared to be moving.

Moreover, we cannot recall too often, the ideologists of that time believed that the Soviet Union was out to conquer the world. At stake, as Paul Nitze, former Dillon Read invest-ment banker, wrote in the secret re-militarization plan known as NSC-68, was "the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself."[^1] Intensification of the Cold War would plant "the seeds of destruction within the Soviet system" resulting in a fundamental change in the system or its collapse. The plan admitted to being "in effect a policy of calculated and gradual coercion."[^2]

Public and congressional opposition to rearmament (the grand plan was kept secret for 25 years) only broke when China entered the war in Korea in late 1950. By 1952, the military budget had more than tripled to $44 billion while the services doubled to 3.6 million men and women. The per-manent war economy was a reality. Meanwhile repression of domestic political dissent reached near hysteria.

In the process the CIA's covert operations, already in progress in Europe, expanded worldwide. By 1953, accord-ing to the 1970s Senate investigation, there were major covert programs under way in 48 countries, consisting of propagan-da, paramilitary, and political action operations. The bu-reaucracy also grew. In 1949, the Agency's covert action arm had about 300 employees and seven overseas field stations; three years later it had 2,800 employees and 47 field stations. In the same period, the budget for these activities grew from $4.7 million to $82 million.[^3]

(Image: A barricade with "DANGER" and "STAND" signs in New York, U.S.A.)

Covert operations became a way of life, or better said, a way of death, for the millions of people abroad who lost their lives in the process. By the Reagan-Bush period in the 1980s, covert operations were costing billions of dollars. CIA Direc-tor William Casey would be quoted as saying that covert action was the "keystone" of U.S. policy in the Third World.[^4]

Throughout the CIA's 45 years, one president after another has used it to intervene secretly, and sometimes not so secretly, in the domestic affairs of other countries, presuming their affairs were ours. Almost always, money was spent for activities to prop up political forces considered friendly to U.S. interests, or to weaken and destroy those considered unfriendly or threatening.

### Friends and Enemies

The friends were easy to define: those who believed and acted like us, took orders, cooperated. Until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, enemies were also readily recognized: the Soviet Union and its allies, with China hav-ing ambiguous status since the 1970s. But how to explain covert action taken against others, not associated with the Soviets? Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Indonesia in 1958, Cuba in 1959, Ecuador in 1963, Brazil in 1964, Chile in 1970, Nicaragua in 1979, and Grenada in 1983—to name a few.

These governments, and others attacked by the U.S., were left, nationalist, reform-minded, populist or simply unco-operative—and U.S. hostility did indeed drive some of them to seek arms and other support from the Soviet Union. But why initially were they seen as threatening?

What U.S. interests needed protection from these govern-ments or from like-minded movements seeking power? The answers to these questions from the past show the need for continuity in the future. Although the Cold War has ended, the covert and overt interventions which characterized it will surely continue undiminished in the post-Soviet era.

### The Threat of Self-Determination

Around 100 years ago, U.S. leaders, like their European counterparts before them, recognized a fundamental strategy for enhancing the domestic economy and at the same time increasing international power. Already U.S. production was too great for the domestic market to absorb, and excess capital was looking for investment overseas. It was essential to ensure access to foreign markets, as well as to cheap resources and labor. These goals required an interventionist foreign policy wherein "their" resources were theirs only by accident of geography. Today the U.S. economy is more dependent than ever on access to foreign resources through the operations of transnational corporations, especially in the Third World. But this access is constantly at risk because those countries so often have grossly unjust, and therefore unstable, domestic systems. Some are autocratic, but many are akin to the U.S., with formal democracy and an en-trenched elitist ruling minority. The difference, of course, is that their "underclass" is the mass of the population whereas ours, although increasing, is still proportionally much smaller.

(Image: Bread line in an urban setting)

Despite brutal repression, people throughout the Third World disputed not only the right of the U.S. to erode their national sovereignty, but they also challenged the legitimacy of their own ruling minorities—often remnants from colo-nialism. Their nationalist political and economic agendas meant reduced dependence on, and, therefore reduced con-trol by, the North. Government programs to favor peasants, the working class, and the poor violated free market prin-ciples, and were a bad example. Agrarian and urban reform programs violated individual property rights, including those of foreigners. And, worst of all, they were seen to breach U.S.-led anticommunist solidarity. Usually, the CIA mounted covert operations to weaken and destroy the the programs—and with no small success. Local elites, whose privileged position was also threatened by movements for social change, were the CIA's natural allies.

### High Stakes

The economics of Cold War domination meant large trans-fers of wealth from South to North. Consider only the last decade. From 1982—when the debt crisis reached critical mass—to 1990, the net flow of wealth from South to North was $418 billion. This net transfer resulted from average monthly payments of interest and principal of nearly $12.5 billion or a nine-year total of $1.3 trillion. Such payments, as Susan George points out in her recent book, *The Debt Boomerang*, were only possible through accumulation of new debt by the poor countries, which by the end of 1990 owed 61 percent more than in 1982.[^5] Mass misery and environmen-tal destruction in the South are part and parcel of the continu-ing net transfer.

While the East-West dimension of the Cold War was a stand-off from the beginning, it was here, within the North-South dynamic, that both the economic battle and the shoot-ing wars raged. As long as the underlying rationale—control of resources, labor and markets—remains, these conflicts are bound to continue irrespective of the disappearance of the East-West conflict. And as long as injustice, exploitation, and repression prevail, whether in the form of "structural adjust-ments" or death squads, people will resist. The U.S. will react to the resulting "instability" as it has for decades: with covert operations mounted against movements for independence, reform, and social justice, whether they have achieved power, as in Cuba, or whether they are struggling for power. Until U.S. definitions of threats, friends, and enemies change—and they are unlikely to without profound alterations in the U.S. domestic system—its need for covert operations will continue.

### Means and Ends

For a hint of covert operations in the 1990s and beyond, it is instructive to reconsider some recent examples from the 1980s with emphasis on means and ends.

Central America was a major focus of U.S. attention during this period. Through CIA covert and semi-covert operations, and overt activities as well, the U.S. tried simul-taneously to overthrow the government of Nicaragua and to destroy the movement for revolutionary reform in El Sal-vador, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). In Nicaragua the means were terrorism and destruc-tion through a 10,000-strong surrogate paramilitary force, along with economic blockade, propaganda and diplomatic pressures. About one percent of the population, some 35,000 people, died. In El Salvador, the CIA and U.S. military expanded local military and security forces, and by extension the infamous death squads, to enable the government to fight the FMLN to a standoff. In the effort, the U.S.-backed forces killed over 70,000 people. Although they targeted trade un-ionists, student activists, human rights advocates and peasant organizers, the majority of the casualties—randomly selected campesinos—were killed or disappeared simply to instill terror. Under the guise of exporting democracy, the CIA and other U.S. agencies in El Salvador promoted "demonstration elections" as public relations exercises to cover their clients' atrocities. The military-controlled civilian government could then be renamed a "fledgling democracy."[^6]

In the 1980s, in both Nicaragua and El Salvador, the U.S. introduced a new vehicle for exporting U.S.-style democra-cy—the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Its origins go back to the early catastrophic scandal that erupted after Agency covert op-erations were revealed in 1967. I remember the gloom in the CIA when *Ramparts* magazine revealed the Agency's control and funding of the U.S. Na-tional Student Association's (NSA) foreign activities pro-gram. Suddenly, because of overlapping funding through U.S. foundations and front groups, the links between the Agency and scores of foreign trade unions, student and youth organizations, political institutes, and publications spread in the U.S. and foreign press. Usually the money flow was from the Agency to a real or bogus foundation, then to a U.S. private organization like NSA or a trade union, and from there to the foreign recipient.

Two months after the revelations began, some mem-bers of the House of Repre-sentatives, led by Dante Fas-cell (D-Fla.), proposed legisla-tion to create an "open," government-financed foundation to carry on financing the activities recently revealed as CIA-connected. The idea was to make money available "over-the-table" to foreign political parties, trade unions, student groups and other private or-ganizations—not to eliminate secret CIA money but to pro-vide an alternative, given the perennial problem of recipients in "covering" the CIA money.

The Fascell proposal went nowhere because of the break-down of the Democratic-Republican "bipartisan" consensus during the Vietnam war. But by 1979, the idea resurfaced with the establishment of the American Political Foundation. Backed by "internationalist" Republicans and "Cold War" Democrats, this institute set out to study the feasibility of government financing of the foreign activities of private U.S. organizations. Participants came from rightwing think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.[^7]

### The West German Model

The study—made through "task forces" set up by the two political parties, the AFL-CIO, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce—became known as the "Democracy Program." The participants eventually adopted the West German model of gov-ernment-financed private foun-dations linked to each of that country's four main political parties. The program was used in the 1950s to channel CIA "de-mocracy-building" money to the West German parties. By the 1960s these foundations were supporting parties and organiza-tions around the world with West German government money—and at the same time they served as conduits for CIA money to third country organizations.

By the 1980s, the German foundations had programs worth about $150 million in some 60 countries. And they op-erated in almost total secrecy. Equally appealing was the way the German foundations had been able to sustain like-minded political organizations in coun-tries under dictatorships such as Greece during the "Colonels" regime, Spain under Franco, and Portugal under Salazar and Caetano. The arrangement allowed correct government-to-government relations with simultaneous "private" support to political forces opposed to their governments. These forces, beholden to their donors, would then be in position to fill the political gap on the eventual fall of the dictatorship, exclud-ing communists and others to the left of social democrats.

Ronald Reagan, an early and enthusiastic supporter of the Democracy Program, described it in his speech to the British Parliament in June 1982 as building "an infrastructure of democracy" around the world. Originally he set up a "Project Democracy" in the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) by secret Executive Order, which included participation by CIA Director Casey. When his connection leaked to the press, the CIA's role was supposedly canceled. An early project under this set-up was a $170,000 grant to a U.S. public relations firm, MacKenzie, McCheyne, Inc., which had earlier repre-sented the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua. In a kind of finishing school, image-improvement course for murderers, it taught "media officials" in El Salvador and similarly be-sieged client governments how to deal with U.S. media.

Since the whole idea was to "privatize," and USIA was part of government, its role was only a temporary solution. The future pattern of intervention was more clearly filled out when Congress established the private, non-profit founda-tion, the National Endowment for Democracy, and appro-priated $18.8 million in November 1983. The law appropriating the money gave an idea of how private NED was. It stipulated that NED could have no projects of its own—it is purely a funding channel—and that the U.S. government would have full access to NED's files, papers, and financial records. NED officers would have to testify before Congress whenever called. In practice, the Depart-ment of State and other government agencies like the CIA are part and parcel of the formulation and approval process of NED projects.

Monies appropriated by Congress would pass through NED to any of four private foundations, known as "core groups," set up for the purpose by: 1) the AFL-CIO (the Free Trade Union Institute); 2) the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the Center for International Private Enterprise); 3) the Re-publican Party (the National Republican Institute for Inter-national Affairs); and 4) the Democratic Party (the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs). NED, for its part, encouraged others in the private sector to set up foun-dations for getting money into foreign activities, e.g., media, academics, lawyers and clergy.

In the available documentation on NED, I never came across any consideration that these private U.S. organizations might raise funds through public appeals or ask their mem-bership to pay for their foreign programs—i.e., real "pri-vatization." What happened with NED, in fact, was simply a continuation of public funding for intervention in foreign countries using new conduits, with the "private" organiza-tions serving as instruments of U.S. foreign policy. The means and ends, formerly secret and justified by anticom-munism, were transformed into an open agenda devoted to promoting U.S.-style democracy.

Each of the four recipient foundations, in statements of purpose, followed the central theme of the Democracy Pro-gram study: political action abroad to meet the Soviet "global ideological challenge." Projected beneficiaries covered the spectrum: governments, political parties, information media, professional associations, universities, cooperatives, trade unions, employers' associations, churches, women, youth, and students—in short, all traditional CIA covert action targets.

As for the Soviet Bloc, NED money would be used to promote anticommunist dissidence through propaganda and support to émigré groups and internal opposition movements. Projected activities included conferences, exchange-of-persons, seminars, training programs, publi-cations, and, above all, financial support. NED as a mega-conduit also expanded possibilities for "open" funding of activities controlled behind the scenes by the Agency, as well as the means for spotting potential recruits as sources of intelligence and agents of influence.

### Panama: Just 'Cause the U.S. Wanted Control

Panama was an early example of political intervention through NED. For the 1984 elections, General Manuel Antonio Noriega selected an economist, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, as presidential candidate of the military-controlled Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). Barletta was a vice president of the World Bank and former student of Secretary of State George Shultz at the University of Chicago. The other candidate was no friend of the U.S. Arnulfo Arias' long political career had centered on na-tionalism and populism. The U.S. feared that, if elected, his anti-military platform would bring instability to Panama.

The U.S. interest was to ensure that a new Panamanian president would continue to cooperate with U.S. efforts to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua and to defeat the insurgency in El Salvador. Noriega, a long-time CIA "asset," was at the time providing services of great importance to the U.S., allowing Panama to be used for Contra training and resupply bases, as well as for training Salvadoran military officers. Barletta's election would as-sure untroubled continuation of these activities.[^8]

During the election campaign, NED money passed through the AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute to finance Panamanian unions which actively supported Barletta. A vote-count fraud organized by Noriega gave Barletta his election victory, but the Reagan-Bush administration made no protest even though the U.S. Embassy count showed Arias the winner by 4,000-8,000 votes.[^9] Reagan received Barletta in the White House and Shultz attended his inauguration. A more thorough study of the 1984 Panamanian elections would probably uncover more NED money and suggest the passage of CIA funds as well. By 1987, Noriega's usefulness to the U.S. was coming to an end. Procedures were under way for his indictment by the Justice Department for drug trafficking, and U.S. agencies, including the CIA, began plotting to remove him from power.

### How NED Works

In the spring of 1987, NED financed a trip by the president of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Aurelio Barria, to the Philippines. The purpose was for Barria to learn the operation of a Filipino national civic and political action organization, NAMFREL (National Movement for Free Elec-tions). Originally set up by the CIA in 1951 as a vehicle for the presidential election of the Agency's man, Ramon Mag-saysay, NAMFREL had played a key role in monitoring the 1986 Philippine elections.[^10] Through parallel tabulation, NAMFREL was able to expose the fraudulent "re-election" of Ferdinand Marcos and then help mobilize the "people power" that forced him out. As it happened, the Agency for Interna-tional Development (AID) gave NAMFREL nearly $1 million for its work in the 1986 election. The funds were channeled through NED and the Asia Foundation (set up by the CIA in the 1950s as a funding front).[^11]

Aurelio Barria's planned role was to set up a NAMFREL-style organization in Panama in preparation for 1989 elec-tions—still almost two years away—in the likelihood that Noriega would again manipulate the count. However, just as Barria returned from Manila, Noriega's number two in the Panamanian Defense Force, Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, pre-cipitated a national crisis by going public with sensational accusations against Noriega, including political murder and the rigging of the 1984 election. Spontaneous anti-Noriega demon-strations followed, with thousands rioting against Noriega's police.

Barria moved quickly into the lead of the anti-Noriega movement. On the first day of demonstrations, he launched his Pana-manian NAMFREL as the Civic Cru-sade for Justice and Liberty. Some two hundred pro-fessional, busi-ness, religious and civic organiza-tions participated.[^12]

For a week the demonstrations continued, with Barria's Civic Crusade leading the call for civil disobedience, a national strike, and Noriega's resigna-tion. Noriega survived that crisis, but the Civic Crusade, which evolved into a minority White, upper-class movement, continued its campaign of agitation through, and beyond, the 1989 election. Noriega eventually nullified that election when the Crusade's (and the U.S.'s) preferred presidential candidate, Guillermo Endara, appeared to be winning.

With the CIA behind the scenes manipulating the Civic Crusade, the events in Panama which culminated in the invasion followed a pattern well-established in many other countries besides the Philippines. One close observer of Panama, the journalist John Dinges, wrote of "at least five covert action plans to get rid of Noriega." In addition, the CIA reportedly had a budget of $10 million for support to Endara in the 1989 elections.[^13] In the end, only U.S. military invasion would end Noriega's rule, and the Civic Crusade, by creating a lynching atmosphere outside the Papal Nuncio's residence, would force the General to surrender. The lessons of the Noriega saga are clear enough. The Bush justification of the invasion—to combat drug trafficking and bring No-riega to justice—could not be the real reason because the CIA and other agencies had known of his drug dealing since the early 1970s.[^14] The real reasons were that Noriega was no longer needed for support of U.S. goals in Nicaragua and El Salvador, had become an embarrassment by defying U.S. hegemony, and was himself the source of instability in Pana-ma. Using Noriega as a pretext for invasion, the Bush ad-ministration could destroy the Panamanian Defense Forces and reverse the social reforms favoring the poor majority, mostly Black and mulatto, that had been underway since the Torrijos period began in 1968. With the traditional White political elite back in power, the door was open to retaining U.S. military bases and control of the Panama Canal past the 1999 turnover date set by the Carter-Torrijos treaties.

On the night of the invasion, Guillermo Endara, repre-sentative of the White upper class, was sworn in as President on a U.S. military base, and democracy was "restored." Within a short time, drug dealing and money laundering in Panama would exceed that of the Noriega period, and poor Panamanians would presumably be back in their place—in poverty and under control.[^15] But resistance to U.S.-imposed rule continued, as George Bush could plainly see—through eyes smarting from tear gas—as he was whisked from the speakers' platform in Panama where he stopped in May 1992 on his way to the Rio Earth Summit.

### Nicaragua

Military force was also required to "restore democracy" in Nicaragua. In this case, however, the invasion was carried out by a surrogate army of 10,000 Contras built by the CIA around the remnants of the 43-year Somoza dictatorship's National Guard, itself a U.S. creation. Beginning in 1981, through terrorism, atrocity and destruction, this force grad-ually bled the economy, undermined Sandinista social pro-grams, and demoralized a large sector of the population which had benefited during the revolution's early years. By 1990, faced with nothing but worsening poverty and continu-ing terror, the Nicaraguan electorate—as if with a loaded pistol to the head—gave victory to the Nicaraguan Opposi-tion Union (UNO). This anti-Sandinista coalition was created and financed by various U.S. agencies, including the CIA and NED.[^16]

Anyone with a modest acquaintance with U.S. national security doctrine since World War II would have assumed that the 1979 Sandinista revolution could never be acceptable to the elites who control the United States. After all, the Sandinistas were of a similar cut to the Cuban revolution which, in 1959, triumphed against another U.S.-backed dic-tator. Worse, the Cubans, and later the Sandinistas, estab-lished policies designed to benefit the majority of the people, especially peasants and workers, through agrarian reform, literacy campaigns, and expansion of education, health care, and mass organizations among women, youth and students, small farmers, and others.

Property rights, especially of the minority upper classes, would have to yield if reform programs were to be effective, as would the rights of foreign capital. As occurred in Cuba and in Nicaragua, mass mobilization of the beneficiary popu-lation—the vast majority—was an ugly and threatening sight, another bad example breaking traditional apathy and fatalism by giving lower-class people hope, confidence, and dignity. Intervening in the human marketplace and upsetting the "natural order" of rewards and punishments for the de-fenseless smacked of "communism."[^17]

In order to undermine links between the Sandinistas and the people, the CIA deflected the Contras away from the Nicaraguan military toward "soft" targets having minimum defenses: cooperatives, clinics, schools, and infrastructure like roads and bridges, committing numerous atrocities along the way.[^18] Specialized teams of mercenaries destroyed port installations and mined harbors. As a result, average in-dividual consumption dropped 61 percent between 1980 and 1988. One estimate puts the U.S. investment in the Contra war at $1 billion. Though the Contras successfully sabotaged the economy and terrorized large sectors of the rural popula-tion, they failed to defeat the Sandinista military or even to take and hold the smallest town for any length of time.

Meanwhile the U.S. economic blockade, both the bilateral trade embargo and the blocking of loans from multilateral lending institutions, cost the economy $3 billion.[^19] Eventually the World Court ruled that the United States was carrying on a war against Nicaragua in violation of international law and ordered $17 billion in reparations, an order which the U.S. predictably ignored.

### U.S. Directs the Propaganda War

From the beginning of the war against Nicaragua, the Reagan-Bush administration faced the problem of overcom-ing public opposition at home. The solution was to repeat Edward W. Barrett's 1950 domestic propaganda campaign to "sell the Soviet threat" and thus reduce opposition to the programs of NSC-68.[^20] In 1982, a CIA propaganda specialist, Walter Raymond, moved from the Agency to the National Security Council to head the campaign while the Contras, under CIA direction, began their own PR campaign in the U.S. Controlled behind the scenes by Raymond and officials running the Contra war, a public front was set up in the State Department as the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean. This office then handled the contacts with think tanks, researchers and, most impor-tantly, the U.S. media.[^21]

The purpose was to place, in the public's imagination, black hats on the Sandinistas and white hats on the Contras. In effect, it became a huge government campaign using taxpayer money to propagandize the same taxpayers and their representatives in Congress. Following various revelations, a congressional investigation concluded in 1987 that the campaign had been illegal. Nevertheless, this Ministry of Truth played a successful role in building the U.S. media consensus that the Sandinistas were unacceptable and must be driven from power.

By 1987 it was clear that, although they could continue to terrorize and destroy infrastructure, the Contras could never win a military victory. That year the Central American presi-dents, in the Esquipulas Accords, agreed to end Contra ac-tivities on their territories, thus beginning the process that eventually led to a ceasefire. The agreements also shifted attention to the political struggle within Nicaragua that would culminate in the 1990 elections. During the interim of two-and-a-half years, the CIA, NED, and other U.S. agencies would intervene with massive psychological, economic, and political engineering programs, probably unprecedented in relation to Nicaragua's population of 3.5 million. By then, they could lay the blame for Nicaragua's economic collapse on the Sandinistas as well as exploit the FSLN's own mis-takes.

The U.S. plan called for mobilizing three main bodies: a political coalition to oppose the Sandinistas, a trade union coalition, and a mass civic organization. Within these three main sectors, sub-groups would focus on youth and students, women, religious organizations, and others. Media opera-tions would be central to the campaign, which would include seminars, training of activists, and grass roots organizing.[^22]

The first sector, the political coalition, was forged by the U.S. Embassy in Managua from some two dozen disparate and conflicting factions by letting it be known that money would be available only to those that "got on board." The result was UNO, whose electoral budget was prepared in the U.S. Embassy, and whose presidential candidate, Violeta Chamorro, owned the anti-Sandinista daily *La Prensa*, which had received CIA money from early on.

The second sector, the labor coalition, came into being as the Permanent Workers Congress (CPT). This organization, crucial to using the economic crisis as a principal campaign issue, grouped five union centers for propaganda and voter registration. Some of these unions had also received prior U.S. funding. The third sector, the civic organization, became Via Cívica following the NAMFREL and Cruzada Cívica ex-amples in the Philippines and Panama. Although self-de-scribed as "non-partisan," it functioned in concert with UNO and CPT.

The National Endowment for Democracy spent at least $12.5 million to finance this structure, passing out the money to the Democratic and Republican parties' institutes men-tioned above, as well as to the AFL-CIO, which in turn passed the money to recipients in Nicaragua. Other NED money went to an array of intermediary organizations in the U.S. and other countries that spent it for programs in training, pro-paganda and support for the coalitions. In all, NED funds were the equivalent of a $2 billion foreign intervention in a U.S. election. The CIA, in addition, is estimated to have spent $11 million, possibly even more, in the election.

Not to be forgotten, the still-armed and U.S.-financed Contras played a key role in the election. During the summer of 1989, taking advantage of a Sandinista unilateral ceasefire then in effect, they began large-scale infiltration of forces from bases in Honduras. They ended months of relative calm, elevating their military actions from an average of 100 per month during the first six months of 1989 to 300 per month by October, four months before the election. In the seven months from August 1989 to the February 1990 election, the Contras killed dozens and kidnapped some 700 civilians, including 50 Sandinista campaign officials. During the same period, they openly campaigned for UNO, distributing leaf-lets and threatening peasants if they failed to vote UNO.

By election time Nicaraguan voters, whose per capita standard of living was declining to the Haitian level, were given a grim choice in this "free and fair" election: Vote for the Sandinistas and the ten-year war will go on with ever-worsening poverty and violence; or, vote for UNO and the war and economic blockade will end and the U.S. will help finance reconstruction. UNO won 55 percent of the vote, the Contras were partially disarmed, and modest amounts of U.S. aid began to flow—nothing, however, in comparison with the destruction visited by the U.S. on Nicaragua during the Contra war. Two years into the Chamorro government, UNO had split over the depth and pace of rolling back the revolu-tion and had failed to make good its pledges of land and other support for former Contras and Sandinista military alike. The Sandinistas still controlled the army and police and were still the largest and best organized of the political parties.

The U.S. government was far from happy with Chamorro's failure to de-Sandinize Nicaragua, and the drug trade, never a problem during the 11-year Sandinista rule, was becoming a national plague, both in consumption and transshipment to the U.S. And conflict over such matters as land titles meant continuing instability. For many, if not most, the war and devastation continued.[^23]

The manner in which the U.S. "restored democracy" in Panama and Nicaragua taught rich lessons. Cuban leadership, fully aware that any opening for U.S.-exported elections would mean tens of millions of dollars of NED, CIA, and other foreign money for "electoral counter-revolution," re-jected such an option. The FMLN in El Salvador, converting to a political party following the 1992 peace accords, will have the Nicaraguan experience to elucidate U.S. interven-tion against them in elections scheduled for 1994. And, back in Nicaragua, the CIA-NED-AID machinery is still operating to prevent the Sandinistas' return to power in the 1996 election.

### Once and Future Covert Operations

The current U.S. defense plan, at $1.5 trillion for the next five years, suggests that the money will be there for covert interventions. The Bush plan, largely accepted by both hous-es of Congress, calls for a mere three percent reduction in defense spending under projections made before the dissolu-tion of the Soviet Union. According to Robert Gates, Director of Central Intelligence, reductions in the intelligence com-munity budget—hidden in the overall defense budget but generally believed to be in excess of $31 billion—will begin at only 2.5 percent.[^24] Meanwhile plans under discussion in Congress for reorganizing the whole intelligence community would maintain the capability and legality, under U.S. law at least, of covert operations.[^25]

As the Defense Department, the CIA, and other intel-ligence agencies have had to articulate new justifications for their budgets now that the Soviet menace is gone. In collec-tion and analysis, announced targets include: arms control agreements; economic matters; the spread of nuclear, chemi-cal, and biological weapons; terrorism; the drug trade; Is-lamic fundamentalism; and regional, ethnic, and national disputes. Generally they argued: With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the world is far less stable, less predictable, and even more dangerous than before.

More suggestive of future intelligence operations was the 1992 series of leaks of highly classified Pentagon documents on military planning. The first, in February, was a 70-page study projecting U.S. military requirements over the next ten years. The report outlined seven possible scenarios which U.S. forces would have to be prepared to face, and, presumably, would require those $1.5 trillion for the first five years.[^26]

*   war with Iraq
*   war with North Korea
*   simultaneous wars with both Iraq and North Korea
*   a war to defend a Baltic state from a resurgent and expansionist Russia
*   war to defend the lives of U.S. citizens threatened by instability in the Philippines
*   war to defend the Panamanian government and the canal against "narco-terrorists"
*   the emergence of an anti-U.S. global "adversarial rival" or an "aggressive expansionist international coalition."

The following month the *New York Times* published ex-cerpts from another classified Pentagon document revealing the latest military policy to which the war scenarios were linked. This 46-page document, known formally as "Defense Planning Guidance—1994-99" was, according to the *Times*, the product of deliberations among President Bush, the Na-tional Security Council and the Pentagon. Its importance in prolonging U.S. militarism and the war economy into the 21st century could equal NSC-68's role in beginning the Cold War arms race in 1950.[^27]

The goal of world hegemony expressed in the 1992 docu-ment should be as alarming to current U.S. friends such as Japan and NATO allies as to adversaries. "Our strategy must now refocus on precluding the emergence of any future global competitor.... Our first objective is to prevent the emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere...."

Notably lacking was any mention of collective settlement of disputes through the United Nations, although future mul-tilateral actions through coalitions, as in the Gulf War, were not ruled out. And in order to prevent acquisition of nuclear weapons by potential adversaries, the U.S. asserted the need to be ready for unilateral military action.

As for Washington's friends, both Japan and Western Europe would be locked into security arrangements domi-nated by the United States. Without mentioning countries, the U.S. "must account sufficiently for the interests of the ad-vanced industrial nations to discourage them from challeng-ing our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order.... [W]e must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role."

The document went on to suggest how to prevent Europe, with Germany in the lead, from becoming an independent regional arbiter in its own territory. "Therefore it is of fun-damental importance to preserve NATO as the primary chan-nel for U.S. influence.... [W]e seek to prevent the emergence of European-only security arrangements which would under-mine NATO, particularly the alliance's integrated command structure, ...a substantial American presence in Europe is vital..."

Publication of the globo-bully unipolar plan for the New World Order caused the diplomatic blowback one would expect, an unwanted new debate in Congress, and wide criticism in the media. To no one's surprise, two months later a secret rewrite of the plan leaked again to the media—this time no doubt intended to quell the uproar from the earlier plan. Gone was the potential threat from allies and the pro-jected global U.S. unilateralism.[^28]

The first goal of U.S. defense planning in the rewrite was deterrence of attack, followed by strengthening alliances, and preventing "any hostile power from dominating a region critical to our interests, and also thereby to strengthen the barriers against the reemergence of a global threat to the interests of the U.S. and our allies." Cooperation was now the theme, although the rewrite also reserved the U.S. right to unilateral military intervention. In addition, the original se-ven war scenarios remained the basis for budget requests.

None of the three documents was published in full, and the New York Times refused to share copies. Nevertheless, three observations can be made on the commentaries and excerpts that came out in the leaks. First, the rewrite did not preclude or renounce any of the ideas contained in the pre-vious version. Second, the budget of $1.5 trillion and the base force of 1.6 million remain. Third, the purpose of the rewrite was doubtless to assuage critics and allies, while the true goal remains U.S. world hegemony.

The good news, sort of, is that the goals are unattainable. The U.S. economy cannot support global unilateralism or even war against a country like Iraq. How then, with its notorious debt and deficit, can it possibly impose its will on Japan and Europe, especially if the French-German Euro-corps takes hold in the military sphere independent of U.S. influence in NATO? This French initiative flies in the face of U.S. policy to keep European defense under U.S. domination in NATO and could be the beginning of the end of that policy. Little wonder that U.S.-French relations are so sour.

### Covert Ops Head East

Keeping in mind that covert operations, as well as overt diplomacy, are supposed to prevent war or the need to use military force—including the seven scenarios—consider how this would be done. To keep Russia from resurging, expanding, and again rivaling the U.S.—like the sci-fi "blob"—that country must remain hopelessly indebted and dependent on imports of basic necessities. Aid must be cali-brated to keep Russia stable without allowing the economy to "take off" on its own steam. For these purposes the usual instruments will suffice: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Russia's military industries must be dismantled or converted to alternative production, and the country locked into security arrangements, perhaps eventually in NATO. Western experts, especially from the U.S., must penetrate its economic and political decision-making and its most ad-vanced research in science and technology. No one political party should become dominant, and, where possible, Western parties should establish close working relations with Russian parties. Ultra-nationalists must be discredited and shackled along with unreconstructed remnants of the old regime. The media should be filled with Western and Western-style pro-gramming, including consumerism, info-tainment for news, and healthy doses of anticommunist and pro-free market propaganda. The same would hold for the other countries of the former Soviet Union.

The whole area is like Germany and Italy after World War II, wide open for a double whammy from the CIA and its new sidekick, the NED—and all the Western "private" organiza-tions they use. As with European fascists and the scant de-nazification that occurred, the new Russia can be built on communists-turned-liberals or social democrats, or even, why not, conservatives and Christian Democrats. As after World War II,[^29] the usual suspects can be targeted, neutral-ized or co-opted: political parties, military and security ser-vices, trade unions, women's organizations, youth and students, business, professional and cultural societies, and, probably most important, the media.

Pure fantasy? Just imagine. If Carl Bernstein's long report in *Time*[^30] on the 1980s operations of the CIA, NED, Vatican, and their vast network to undo communism in Eastern Europe had any truth, and I believe it did, then can anyone imagine that, with their feet already through the door, they wouldn't follow up their success? The beneficiaries of this and other 1980s operations are now the key to transforming former Soviet bloc countries into traditional Third World-style mar-kets and sources of raw materials and cheap labor. The CIA-NED team can be crucial in exercising political influence and in forming the permanent structures to assure that American transnationals get their hot hands, in the race against Ger-many, on the resource-richest land mass on the globe.

### Keeping the Government On War Footing

How to avoid another war with Iraq? United Nations sanctions and reparations payments can keep Iraq weak for a long time, while Saddam's continuation in power avoids the possibly even worse alternatives. Meanwhile covert opera-tions can be useful for planning a cooperative, post-Saddam Iraq. Until then, we can expect cultivation of contacts within the Ba'ath movement, support for exile groups, clandestine radio and television broadcasts, joint efforts with "moderate" Arab governments and allies, and occasional destabilization like flooding the country with counterfeit currency. The Bush administration, according to the *New York Times*, is seeking $40 million for these covert operations in 1993, a nearly three-fold increase over 1992.[^31]

How to avoid another war with North Korea? Keep South Korea strong as a deterrent and a U.S. troop presence to trigger military intervention should hostilities break out. Make certain that reunification talks lead toward the German solution, i.e., absorption of North Korea by the South. Use propaganda and cross-border contacts to foment dissidence in North Korea while conditioning any benefits on relaxation of internal controls, especially of the media. Repeat the CIA-NED strategy in Eastern Europe whenever an opening occurs. As for the Philippines, absent agrarian and other significant reforms, U.S. military intervention could be a last resort should the New People's Army achieve enough mo-mentum to create significant destabilization or even victory.

For the time being, continue the CIA-Pentagon "low-inten-sity" methods already under way. If unsuccessful, and stalemate continues, consider a negotiated settlement as in El Salvador and rely on CIA-NED electoral intervention to exclude the National Democratic Front from power.

The projected scenario of defending the Panama Canal from "narco-terrorists" is ironic, given the drug connections of the people that Operation Just Cause put into power. And why "narco-terrorists" would threaten U.S. access to the canal is difficult to imagine. If reports are true that drug trafficking and money laundering in Panama now exceed the Noriega era, the dealers ought to be quite happy with things as they are. With Noriega out of the way, the CIA-NED duet can take care of the local political scene, preventing resur-gence of nationalism and *Torrijismo* while assuring retention of U.S. bases and control of the canal.

The same could be said of the electoral processes of any Third World country. CIA-NED preparations are no doubt already under way for defeating obvious coming electoral threats: the FMLN in El Salvador in 1994, the Workers' Party of Brazil in 1994, and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in 1996—to mention only three examples in Latin America. The goal is to exclude from power the likes of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose 1990 election in Haiti was a severe and unusual embarrassment for the system.

Many other scenarios for overt and covert intervention come to mind. The Shining Path in Peru is particularly worrisome for CIA-Pentagon planners in "regional and na-tional" conflict management. So far, it seems, the standard "low intensity" methods have not been notably successful, nor has Peruvian government and military cooperation been ideal. In a region where nearly half the population now lives under the official poverty line, a victory by this guerrilla force would reverberate like nothing since the Sandinista revolution in 1979. Collective action, including military in-tervention through the Organization of American States, might be possible in the case of Peru. Also possible is the whole range of covert and semi-covert interventions prac-ticed against Cuba for many years and in Nicaragua, Af-ghanistan, Angola, Mozambique, Cambodia, and elsewhere around the globe.

### The Continuity of Oppression

One could go on, but the point is made. Worldwide oppor-tunities and needs for covert operations will remain as long as stability, control, and hegemony form the cornerstone of a U.S. policy that permits no rotten apples or bad examples. And the Pentagon budget is not the only indicator of con-tinuity. In late 1991, Congress passed the National Security Education Act providing $150 million in "start-up" money for development and expansion of university programs in area and language studies, and for scholarships, including foreign studies, for the next generation of national security state bureaucrats. Notable is the fact that this program is not to be administered by the Department of Education but by the Pentagon, the CIA, and other security agencies.[^32] Alterna-tives to continuing militarism abroad and social decay at home exist, as any reader of the alternative press knows quite well. The House Black Caucus/Progressive Caucus budget, providing for 50 percent reduction in military spending over four years, got a full day's debate last March on the House floor and won 77 votes, far more than Bush's budget—stir-ring no mainstream reporting, non-news as it had to be. Steps toward formation of new political parties, the green move-ment, and community organizing are also encouraging.[^33]

Yet militarism and world domination continue to be the main national priority, with covert operations playing an integral role. Everyone knows that as long as this continues, there will be no solutions to domestic troubles, and the U.S. will continue to decline while growing more separate and unequal. Can anyone doubt that the events of Los Angeles will recur? Those struggling in the 1990s for change would do well to remember the repression visited on progressive movements following both World Wars and during the Viet-nam War. The government has no more Red Menace to whip up hysteria, but the "war on drugs" seems to be quite ade-quate for justifying law enforcement practices that have political applications as well. The hunt for aliens and their deportation, and the use of sophisticated methods of repres-sion following the Los Angeles uprising, reveal what has been quietly continuing below the surface for years.[^34] We should be on notice that in the current political climate, with clamor for change everywhere, the guardians of traditional power will not give up without a fight. They will find their "threats" and "enemies" in Black youths, undocumented immigrants, environmentalists, feminists, gays and lesbians, and go on to more "mainstream" opponents in attempts, including domestic covert operations, to divide and discredit the larger movement for reform.

At the Brussels conference, I felt incoherent when asked by someone in the auditorium to comment on problems of the U.S. left in convincing people that progressive alternatives are in the majority's best interest. After I rambled for a while about media, education, divisions, and repression, a man stood up and said: "I'm from Brazil. They say we're Third World and you're First World, but I don't think we're that different. We have a lot of the same problems. But in 1989 the Workers' Party of Brazil, only ten years old, almost won the presidency and may win next time. Maybe the more you get like us, the more people in your country will start to listen."

## Peru: Inching Toward the Abyss

**By Phillip Smith**

With each passing month, Peru slips from bad to worse. Already staggering under the twin burdens of prolonged economic collapse and the fierce Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) insurgency, the country has now been shaken by the end of its 12-year democratic experiment. The *autogolpe* (self-coup), in which President Alberto Fujimori and the military dissolved the government and imposed a dictatorial "Govern-ment of Emergency and National Reconstruction" is the latest manifestation of the profound crises facing Peru. As such, it is an expression of political exhaustion, frustration, and desperation; an intensification of a pre-existing author-itarian response to an increasingly ungovernable Peruvian reality. This reality is shaped not only by the ugly legacy of colonial conquest, but also by Peru's position in the contem-porary world economic order.

### From Fujishock to Fujicoup

When he swept to surprise victory in the 1990 presidential elections, political unknown Alberto Fujimori inherited an economic catastrophe as well as a festering guerrilla war, and increasing U.S. pressure to halt the booming coca and co-caine trade. Fujimori's stunning defeat of the established parties of the left, right, and center reflected a political system sapped not only by its failure to improve economic conditions but also by the increasing separation of the politi-cal parties from the popular bases. The old elitist party machines had failed to meet the participatory demands of an activated populace.

The contradiction between political form and content was nowhere more acute than in *Izquierda Unida* (IU), the Marxist-socialist coalition of parties that gave up its revolutionary vocation to capture electoral politics. Falling into old elitist patterns and neglecting its mass work, IU was instead cap-tured by electoral politics. Meanwhile, outgoing President Alan Garcia's APRA (American Popular Revolutionary Al-liance), which had presided over the dissolution of the eco-nomy, was discredited and in disarray. Both IU and APRA candidates failed to survive the first round of the presidential elections.

Instead, Fujimori, backed by evangelical, small business and informal sector money, and supported in the run-off by APRA, IU, and the Catholic base, came from behind to defeat novelist and free marketeer Mario Vargas Llosa, another political outsider. The suave, urbane, and very European Vargas Llosa ran up against *cholo* (mestizo-indigenous) re-sentment of the White elite. More fundamentally, the voters rejected his promise of austerity and free trade. In fact, much of Fujimori's appeal derived from repeated vows not to impose such a program.

Fujishock came almost overnight when the "populist" president reversed himself. He embraced the "structural re-forms" demanded by the World Bank and IMF if Peru were to return to the good graces of the international financiers and win renewed access to world credit markets. In an effort to balance the budget and snuff out inflation, Fujimori instituted mass layoffs of state workers, slashed social spending, and raised energy and public services prices. Finance Minister Carlos Boloña directed the privatization of critical but troubled state enterprises and worked hand in hand with World Bank "technical advisers" to remove barriers to the free movement of trade and capital. By mid-1991, Finance Ministry sources reported that Peru "was in virtual receiver-ship, with IMF functionaries running the day-to-day affairs of several ministries."[^1]

The austerity program did reduce inflation and allowed the resumption of payments to foreign creditors, but the cost was staggering depression and a huge increase in social misery. More than five million Peruvians fell below the "extreme poverty" level in the last two years, bringing the total to more than half the population. Real per capita income is now below 1970 levels. Fujimori promised but failed to deliver a social emergency spending program. In fact, in the face of widespread misery, social spending has declined to one-fourth the already meager level of ten years ago.[^2]

(Image: President Fujimori in a speech with Army personnel behind him)

The president's sudden and unilateral turn to the IMF program pushed APRA and the left, both of which had sup-ported him against Vargas Llosa, into outright opposition in the legislature and led to the unraveling of Fujimori's per-sonal electoral vehicle, *Cambio '90*. With no political ma-chine or organized constituency to fall back on, Fujimori increasingly turned for support to the military, sectors of the business community, and the international financial organi-zations. He also demonstrated an emerging authoritarian vocation, which was underlined by the press discovery of a secret document detailing plans for a civilian-military junta in early 1991.[^3] Another indication of his imperial style came two months later when, in violation of political protocol, he presented the legislature with a signed anti-drug treaty with the U.S. Through this 1991 agreement, the U.S. forced Fuji-mori to accept heightened militarization of the anti-drug campaign and increased U.S. influence and presence in return for desperately needed direct aid and favorable votes on Peruvian loan requests to the IMF and World Bank.

As popular discontent with his economic program grew, Fujimori's isolation and his authoritarian style were under-scored by his growing dependence on unilaterally-imposed executive decrees. Last November, he issued a package of 126 decree-laws designed to strengthen his hand against both the increasingly combative legislature and the ever-growing insurgency. The decrees allowed him an almost free rein in deepening his neo-liberal economic program and greatly expanded the powers of the military. The generals could now temporarily expropriate property and financial assets, draft anyone into the counterinsurgency effort, intervene in the prisons and universities, ban the publication of information deemed secret by the state, and subordinate civilian to mili-tary authorities in all "emergency areas," i.e., 60 percent of the national territory.[^4]

The decrees, which would be enacted upon the legisla-ture's failure to veto them, ignited a political firestorm, thoroughly poisoning relations between Fujimori and the APRA-dominated legislature. As the political process deteri-orated, Fujimori lashed out against the judicial and legisla-tive branches and the parties, laying the public opinion groundwork for the coup that came on April 5th. That evening Fujimori appeared on nationwide radio and TV and read a "Manifesto to the Nation" with which he dissolved the legis-lature, disempowered the judiciary, and "ordered" the mili-tary and police to seize government buildings, media facilities, and union and political party offices. With this act, Peru moved from formal, if dysfunctional democracy, to overt dictatorship. Fujimori then ordered the arrest of dozens of political opponents, primarily in APRA, and fired more than 100 judges. The Manifesto emphasized what Fujimori clearly saw as his primary task: to "reconstruct" government institutions and deepen the "structural reform" of the eco-nomy. To that end, Fujimori also declared war on both the drug trade and Sendero to "guarantee a climate of peace and tranquility that will make possible domestic and foreign investments." Whether he can deliver is another question.[^5]

At first, the coup received broad public support. Early polls showed approval ratings of 70 percent and higher.[^6] A public frustrated and frightened by rising violence, a declin-ing standard of living, and the impotence and irrelevance of democratic institutions, grasped at Fujimori's straws. Further support came from the national bourgeoisie, with the associa-tion of business organizations, CONFIEP, declaring the coup necessary to "reestablish order and morality in the nation," and asking "friendly countries to not retire their valiant support in order to contribute to the rapid reestablishment of order."[^7]

The "coup coalition" which emerged contained a military contemptuous of civilian politics and desirous of a freer hand against guerrilla violence, a private sector determined to fully implement the IMF program, and those atomized and disaf-fected citizens willing to forsake democracy in exchange for the promise of peace and prosperity. That this alliance can hold together is doubtful; its constituencies have varied and contradictory goals, and in taking on the narcotraffic and Sendero Luminoso, the new Peruvian state may be fighting a losing battle.

### U.S. Response

It is against a background of economic crisis, political, and social disintegration, and looming Maoist revolution, that international reaction to the coup must be measured. For the U.S., Peru's neighbors in the Organization of American States (OAS), and the international financial community, the coup forced a delicate balancing act between a public posture of condemnation and fundamental support of Fujimori's ob-jectives, if not his overt resort to dictatorship.

Initial U.S. response to the coup seemed appropriately harsh. The State Department appeared embarrassed and an-gered that the coup took place while Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Bernard Aronson was ac-tually in Lima, ostensibly to discuss problems in the anti-coca campaign. Within 24 hours Washington condemned Fujimori, demanded a quick re-turn to con-stitutionality, and announced that it was suspend-ing $320 million in economic and military aid and would deliver only humanitarian aid. Secretary of State James Baker similarly enun-ciated a hard line at the April 12-13 emergency meeting of the OAS, vowing to continue the aid suspension until Peru returned to formal democ-racy. Aronson, after serving as head of the State Department Office for Combatting Terrorism, became U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua while the CIA was particularly active mounting such covert activities as the mining of a Nicaraguan harbor and the production and distribution of a terrorism and assassination handbook for the Contras. He went on to become ambassador to Kuwait before his assignment to Peru.[^8]

U.S. condemnation of the coup and loud sup-port for Peruvian democracy, however, rang hol-low. The U.S. had maintained a discreet silence all through the 1980s as the Peruvian military massacred thousands in its "dirty war" against Sendero. Neither did it deem worthy of comment the military's creeping encroachment on civilian political spheres. Even in the months between the dictatorial November decrees and the April coup, the official U.S. silence was deafening. Although both Peruvian commentators and U.S. govern-ment analysts had warned that a move was im-minent, neither the State Department nor Ambassador An-thony Quainton made any public statements warning Fujimori or the military against seizing power.[^9]

### Our Man in Lima

There are also indications that the U.S. has an "inside man" at the very top of the post-coup government. Vladimiro Montesinos, a "national security adviser" to Fujimori as well as his personal attorney, has long-term ties to the CIA. These go back before 1977, when as a staff officer in the Velasco junta, Montesinos was expelled from the army and imprisoned for selling state secrets to the Agency. During the 1980s, Montesinos pursued a lucrative career as a lawyer and front-man for Peruvian and Colombian drug dealers. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intelligence reports from 1991 describe him using his position in Fujimori's inner circle to "arrange the appointment of ministers and advisers as well as transfers of army officers...always with the aim of supporting narcotics trafficking."[^10]

Montesinos' relationship with Fujimori dates to the 1990 presidential election campaign, when he successfully de-fended the candidate against tax evasion charges. Since then he has become the real power at the National Intelligence Service (SIN), the Peruvian equivalent to the FBI and CIA combined.[^11] He is also credited with playing a crucial role in pre-coup plan-ning by advising Fujimori on appoint-ments to key military commands and even personally briefing the military chiefs two days before the coup.[^12]

In 1991, the CIA invited Montesinos to Washington, after which he obtained fresh foreign assistance for SIN, pre-sumably from the Agency. Now he is even more critically placed. Fujimori has en-trusted him with "moralizing" the judicial system, a process that, according to the Andean Commission of Jurists, em-phasizes partisan purges, personal ven-dettas, and caters to military concerns in human rights cases, as much as it does ridding the judiciary of corruption.[^13]

(Image: Ronderos dealing with two captured men accused of being members of the Sendero Luminoso insurgency in Ayacucho, Peru.)

Montesinos has also centralized con-trol of Peru's antidrug initiatives within SIN's Directorate of Narcotics. The U.S. government may have aided Mon-tesinos in his drug war power grab. The CIA secretly funded and equipped SIN's antidrug special operations unit, and in 1991 transported members of the elite corps to the U.S. for training.[^14] Since the coup, the drug trade is booming.[^15]

### Contradictions Within the Three Goals of U.S. Policy

Montesinos' CIA connections raise obvious questions about prior U.S. knowledge of the coup and the CIA's in-fluence in the new regime, questions that cannot yet be definitely answered. They also highlight the contradictions in U.S. policy toward Peru. The rhetoric of democracy aside, U.S. objectives in Peru over the last decade have been three-fold: winning a foreign victory in the domestic "War on Drugs," cementing Peru's submission to free-market, neo-liberal economics and, most recently, preventing Sendero Luminoso from winning its "people's war."

The contradictions among these goals are by now obvious, even in Washington. The economic "shock treatment" pro-duces mass misery that feeds the insurgency, just as the coca eradication programs push the cocaleros toward Sendero. And the military that would fight Sendero is itself corrupted by the drug war. One of Aronson's missions in visiting Lima on April 5, 1992, the day of the coup, was to hand over a list of 170 officers with links to narco-trafficking.[^16] Conversely, a full-fledged counterinsurgency, to have even a chance of success, would require an economic policy capable of "win-ning hearts and minds," a de-escalation of the anti-coca effort, and most probably, a massive, direct, and sustained U.S. involvement.

Despite nettlesome dilemmas, U.S. policy possesses an underlying unity that gives it a substantial identity of inter-ests with Fujimori's authoritarian project: All three policy goals have a profoundly anti-popular thrust and require for their success a passive, demobilized Peruvian nation. Wheth-er in drug war, "dirty war," or the class war of the austerity programs, the only democracy that will serve is that which provides form but not content. Formal democracy, despite its irrelevance to most Peruvians, legitimated the state without endangering either U.S. interests or elite Peruvian privilege. The U.S. will allow itself to be mollified as Fujimori and the military implant a new, more repressive democratic facade; then the U.S. can get back to the pursuit of its deeper interests in Peru.

Although there is keen frustration in drug warrior circles with the failures of the anti-coca efforts, U.S. domestic politics demand that the drug war remain paramount in U.S.-Peruvian relations. Even at the peak of the public offensive against the coup, DEA agents remained in place, and ad-ministration officials emphasized that anti-drug cooperation should continue.[^17]

This well-orchestrated anti-Sendero hysteria, so useful to the U.S. for blaming domestic poverty and crime on imported drugs—not more systemic problems—also gives rise to con-tradiction. It may lead to demands that the U.S. do something. But the mountainous terrain, sheer physical size of Peru (the Upper Huallaga Valley alone is larger than El Salvador), and the advanced state of the insurgency relegate to only marginal impact anything less than a full-scale invasion. Dire parallels with Vietnam are drawn all too loosely, but Peru is a case where the scale and scope of involvement, and very possibly the outcome, merit such comparisons. The word "quagmire" cannot be avoided and perceptive pessimists like RAND Institute analyst Gordon McCormick advise that Peru simply be written off.[^18]

That decision, however, would be a bitter political pill for U.S. leaders to swallow. Another possibility is a multilateral "peacekeeping" force, perhaps under the OAS, which could intervene if Sendero appeared close to victory. Such a force, already discussed in relation to Haiti, would allow the U.S. to pursue its goals in Peru under the cover of a hemispheric response, much as it did in Iraq under the fig leaf of the U.N. Still, while multilateral sponsorship would reduce U.S. ex-posure, prospects for success would be no better than those of a unilateral military intervention.

Finally, whatever the U.S. attempts will be limited by the fact that, unlike Central America, Peru is not "the backyard." It is largely outside the U.S. cultural sphere and is much bigger and more populous than the Central American re-publics. Barring a Vietnam-scale intervention, the U.S. has the ability only to influence the margins in Peru.

### International Response

The international financial community's response to the coup echoed that of the U.S.: in the beginning, speedy official condemnation and economic sanctions. Without the ability to pay its debt arrears to the international agencies or to obtain new loans to reactivate the economy, not only the stabiliza-tion plan but the existence of the Fujimori regime would be in imminent danger.

The international financial community understands and is loath to jeopardize the "progress" Peru has made during two years of Fujishock. Nor are the World Bank and IMF, as the vanguard of capitalism, likely to allow democratic niceties to get in the way of their mission. Furthermore, lenders are paradoxically over a barrel: Most of the monies being held up would have been used to pay off old loans.

Thus it is expected that, like the U.S. sanctions, the inter-national financial siege will be quietly lifted within a few months, especially if Finance Minister Boloña, who is him-self a creature of the lending organizations, can withstand popular pressures to ease up on the austerity program. There will certainly be pressure from commercial lenders on the international organizations to reschedule negotiations quick-ly. Commercial lenders hold nearly $11 billion of Peru's foreign debt and are eager to obtain agreements that would allow them to start collecting.

The OAS, too, has reasons to pursue a softer line than that suggested by its condemnatory April resolution, and by the end of May had already backed away even from that. At a May 18-23 meeting to discuss Peru, the OAS, with the approval of the U.S., accepted a Peruvian timetable for a series of plebiscites and constituent assembly elections that would restore constitutionality by year's end. With accep-tance of the Peruvian proposal, pressures for international sanctions in the OAS have effectively vanished.[^19]

The reasons for the rapid retreat from condemnation of the coup by other Latin American nations are two-fold. Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador all border on Peru, and their governments expressed fears of taking any action that could weaken the regime and result in Sendero's rise to power.[^20] Also, with the entire continent under the sway of neo-liberal economic "reforms," other governing elites could well face popular unrest themselves. The failed coup in Venezuela and the successful Fujicoup, both of which had surprising popular support, suggest that the resort to repressive solutions may not be as discredited as was thought only a few months ago. The governments of Latin America, as a rule, are structurally similar to that of Peru and share a sympathetic understanding of Fujimori's actions. Meanwhile, in what is being termed "neo-colonialism—Asian-style," Japanese and South Korean capital and corporations are flowing into Peru.

### Coca and Cocaine

Coloring the background and distorting the shape of Peru's international and domestic profile is the drug trade. Peruvian coca production, roughly two-thirds of the global total, provides incomes for an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 peasant families in the Upper Huallaga River valley, and for additional tens or even hundreds of thousands of others who profit indirectly from the industry. The coca leaf is grown by peasants, processed into coca paste or refined cocaine, bought by mainly Colombian distribution networks, and smuggled to the consumer markets of the developed world. The industry is a magnet for highlands peasants fleeing violence and poverty, and also attracts city-dwellers who have seen wages slip beneath subsistence levels. The nar-cotraffic complex is one of the few dynamic sectors of the national economy.

(Image: Farmers protest, Peru, 1989.)

The significance of the drug trade reaches far beyond the remote valleys of the eastern Andes. While the illicit status of the business precludes reliable statistics, it is widely ac-knowledged that cocaine accounts for a huge portion of Peru's export earnings. (For example, a self-described "con-servative" estimate is $600-800 million in annual receipts, compared to $2 billion from legal exports.)[^21] As recently as this spring, according to Central Bank sources, the bank purchased $5-6 million per day in U.S. currency from Lima moneychangers, the vast bulk of it assumed to be cocadol-lars.[^22] Clearly, narcotraffic is a pillar of the economy.

And its impact transcends the purely economic to reach the heart and health of the state itself. The huge dollar flows have made corruption so commonplace as to be banal, and unceasing scandals have corroded the integrity of every sec-tor of the state—even, as we have seen, reaching into the presidential palace itself.

Second, Peru's role in the drug trade has provided the impetus for increasingly direct U.S. involvement in Peruvian affairs. Using aid promised under the anti-drug Andean In-itiative as leverage, the U.S. was able to impose its terms on Fujimori in the 1991 anti-drug pact, emphasizing eradication and militarization over Peru's crop substitution and infra-structure development approach. Tensions between the U.S. and Peru have increased, as the Peruvian leader's open criti-cism of the U.S. policy at this year's San Antonio drug summit made clear. On the eve of the coup, however, 30 Green Beret "advisers" and 25 DEA agents were in the field in Peru, U.S. aircraft were flying routine reconnaissance missions over the Huallaga, and $58 million in military assistance for anti-drug activities had been allocated for the current fiscal year. The trend until the coup was toward steadily increasing U.S. involvement.

The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command now has 35,000 troops including reserve units at its disposal. Its head, Gen. George Joulwan, insists that drugs are his highest pri-ority and recently detailed the extent of U.S. militarization of the drug war. He described a support structure "to provide support and assistance to host nation forces" that includes a civic action component, ground-based radar systems, a high-tech communication system, special intelligence teams in regional embassies, and ongoing joint operations by U.S. and regional militaries."[^23] Although "[P]ersistent reports of secret special warfare units in the jungle are denied at every level ...Pentagon documents show authorization for 78 counter-drug 'deployments for special training' this year for Army Special Forces, psychological operations units and Naval Special Warfare teams."[^24]

While the deployments and the military upgrading were ostensibly part of the "war on drugs," they also serve as the infrastructure for an integrated regional counterinsurgency effort. Indeed, since RAND analyst McCormick compiled his grim analysis of Sendero Luminoso's prospects for success—an effort commissioned for the State and Defense Depart-ments in 1990—the U.S. has increasingly focused on the guerrillas.[^25]

The Upper Huallaga has emerged as one of Sendero's key bases—paradoxically because of the drug war. Sendero cadres came with the peasant migration into the region in the early 1980s, and by the end of the decade the insurgency dominated cocalandia. U.S. efforts at crop eradication and suppression of the trade, which simplistically portrayed the peasants as "narcocriminals," made the region fertile ground for Senderista activity. Since the mid-1980s, the party has expanded and consolidated its influence through its charac-teristic mix of painstaking analysis and support of the inter-ests of the peasant base as well as the unhesitating use of violence against its foes. Sendero ensures good prices for the coca crop by outgunning Colombian drug mafias that had forced growers to accept whatever they offered. It also im-posed order on the "Wild West" atmosphere prevailing in the region, much to the pleasure of the growers. The guerrillas also "tax" the Colombians, taking in perhaps tens of millions of dollars in "protection" fees annually.[^26]

Sendero also protects the growers from the security forces, having effectively cornered the army and anti-drug police in their garrisons and replaced the state as the power on the ground. Even the infamous DEA's regional headquarters at Santa Lucia is under virtual siege, having come under direct attack on several occasions. Sendero's presence in the Upper Huallaga has made "success" for the anti-drug campaign impossible; in one of the cruel dilemmas that the party is so good at exploiting, the U.S. and Peruvian governments are forced to choose between ignoring the narcotraffic to con-centrate on counterinsurgency or attempting to suppress the trade, thereby pushing the local population into a closer relationship with Sendero Luminoso.

This dilemma has proved divisive both in U.S.-Peruvian relations and within the Peruvian government itself. The U.S.'s manufactured domestic drug hysteria impels it to emphasize the drug war, without however, allocating to Peru sufficient financial support to develop alternatives to the coca economy. Successive Peruvian administrations, pushed to divert limited resources to the drug war, have criticized this contradiction, and decried U.S. policy as an imposition that impedes the struggle against Sendero. The Peruvian govern-ment's greatest successes against Sendero in the Upper Hual-laga came under General Alberto Arciniega, who, in 1989, turned a blind eye to the narcotraffic and concentrated on coaxing the peasantry into submission instead of brutalizing it. Arciniega was replaced, however, after loud U.S. com-plaints that he was "soft on drugs."

### Sendero Luminoso: Mao in the Andes

To characterize Sendero as narcoterrorist is to misread the movement. Sendero's involvement in the traffic is only a means to an end: the destruction of capitalism in Peru and its replacement with a Cultural Revolution-vintage Maoist state. Abimael Guzmán ("Comrade Gonzalo"), former philosophy professor and the party's undisputed leader, has openly spelled out the party's vision and strategy.[^27]

To achieve its vision, Sendero has embarked on a patient, methodical, and ruthless "prolonged people's war," combin-ing careful political work with extreme but calculated vio-lence. The party possesses a chilling "rationality" in which even horrifying acts of violence make sense in that they advance the revolution by destroying alternatives to the par-ty's vision. With cold calculation, ideological coherence, superb organization, and fierce determination, Sendero has become the world's most effective revolutionary movement.[^28]

Although it first appeared in the garb of a peasant rebel-lion, the party's origins and orientation are those of an autho-ritarian and provincial ultra-left student-intellectual move-ment.[^29] From the beginning, however, one of the party's strengths has been its ability to tailor its message to its targeted social base. While correctly called dogmatic in its adherence to "Marx-Lenin-Mao-Gonzalo Thought," within the confines of its orthodoxy the party displays a most un-dogmatic tactical acuity and flexibility, even brilliance.

In 12 years of armed struggle, the insurgency has grown from making isolated attacks on remote Andean villages to a self-proclaimed, but undisputed "strategic equilibrium" with the Peruvian military in large reaches of the country. At present, conservative analysts estimate that 25 to 40 percent of the country is under Sendero control.[^30] Sendero is equally adept at administering its "New Power;" its structures are complex, extensive, and redundant. As McCormick noted, "targeting such a parallel political infrastructure, under ideal conditions, is a difficult task. In view of Shining Path's current level of institutional development...the task may now be impossible, with or without U.S. military assistance."[^31]

It must be emphasized that Sendero's growth is not merely a function of its organizational prowess or its violence. The insurgency feeds on centuries of repression and malign neglect; it taps into long-standing and unarguably legitimate grievances of the rural, and increasingly urban, population. Its slogan "rebellion is justified" resonates profoundly in a population embittered and emiserated by unending social injustice.

In areas where Sendero's "New Power" is in place, the party typically provides needed social services—education in "people's schools," land redistribution, support for the poorest, and crime prevention—albeit in an authoritarian and militaristic manner. In the highlands, where authoritarian social relations have been the norm since the time of the Incas, Sendero's rule is greeted with passive acquiescence, if not outright enthusiasm. The party is adept at using the often fatal "settling of accounts" with exploitative merchants, land-lords, and venal officials, as well as at ridding the community of thieves, prostitutes, corrupt military, and other "undesir-ables" to win the support of the local population. Sendero's unquestionable brutality in imposing its vision of a just society must be measured against the brutality of the existing social order and the murderous counterinsurgency. Indeed, the Peruvian state's efforts to quash the insurgency have been as ineffective as they are brutal. Each civilian government since Belaúnde (1980-1985) has ceded more and more power to a military that has proven adept only at torture, "disap-pearance," and mass murder directed at the Andean peasantry and increasingly, urban leftists and activists.[^32] As Sendero and the military engage in a deadly danse macabre, the death toll has now climbed to 25,000, with tens of thousands imprisoned and hundreds of thousands of internal refugees.

### The Rondas

*Rondas campesinas* (village self-defense units) have been both a traditional and a contemporary peasant response to lawlessness and the state's inability to, or disinterest in, providing protection from crime and violence. As autonomous expressions of local need, the *rondas* have prov-ed an effective buffer against Sendero. Since 1983, however, the military has imposed *rondas* on reluctant villages in the emergency zones as part of its counterinsurgency strategy.[^33] These military-dominated *rondas* are much less effective. Nonetheless, the military views them not only as a counter to Sendero, but also as a means of asserting control over the rural population. In the last year, government use of *rondas* as counterinsurgency units has intensified, and since last November, villages encompassing some 200,000 peasants have been forcibly organized into the *ronda* structure.[^34]

Poorly armed and ill-trained, *ronderos* are little more than cannon fodder for the counterinsurgency, and as an object of special hatred by Sendero, they have been the victims of some of its worst atrocities. The *ronda* tactic, however, al-lows the military to attempt to turn the "people's war" into a civil war among the peasantry, dissipating it in an orgy of communal violence.

The military response to Sendero has not been comple-mented with a "hearts and minds" counterinsurgency stra-tegy; the Peruvian state is too poor and too weak to implement one, and in vast reaches of the central and south-ern highlands the state no longer exists—only Sendero's "New Power." Economic development and meaningful de-mocracy—the minimum conditions to deflate the insurgen-cy—are beyond the ability of the state to deliver. Given the state's failure to satisfy the legitimate demands of the im-poverished majority, Sendero's message of retribution and revolution resonates loudly.[^35]

### Slouching Toward Lima

While Sendero follows a classic Maoist strategy of encir-cling the city from the countryside, it has, at least since 1988, turned its attention to the capital.[^36] It has created its own mass fronts and attempted to infiltrate or "annihilate" the independent popular organizations that make up the "new social movements" (NSMs). The NSMs are the response of the urban poor to the state's withdrawal of services; they include community kitchens, day-care coops, squatters' or-ganizations, *pueblo joven* (shantytown) dwellers' associa-tions, among others. As autonomous organisms, they must, in Sendero's view, be either incorporated or exterminated.

A vicious struggle is now under way among Sendero, the military, and the legal left for influence in the NSMs, with both the legal left and the armed forces calling for the crea-tion of urban *rondas* to counter Sendero's rapidly increasing urban violence. The legal left, however, is very wary of an alliance with the military; instead, it wishes to counterpose independent *rondas* to the security forces on one hand and Sendero on the other. Senderista violence has always attack-ed popular organizations which it felt were antagonistic to its goals, as well as military and governmental targets. Recently, particularly in Lima, it has focused an increasing proportion of attacks on Sendero opponents in the popular organizations.

The NSMs and the communities in which they exist are deeply divided, splintering under intense pressure from all sides. Some communities, such as the walled settlement of Raucana, are already Senderista redoubts, while others, such as Villa El Salvador, whose vice mayor was brutally mur-dered by a Sendero hit squad in February 1992, are embroiled in factional strife.[^37]

Since the declaration of "strategic equilibrium" in the countryside last year and especially in the aftermath of its first successful "armed strike" in Lima in February, Sendero is signaling that the "people's war" has reached a new phase: preparing for insurrection in the capital. For the first time, the party is trying to establish its "New Power" in Lima and has announced that the pre-insurrectionary moment is now at hand.[^38] At the same time, the party is strengthening its stra-tegic positions in the departments north and south of Lima and consolidating control of the central highlands in prepara-tion for the climactic encirclement and siege of the capital. It will not happen this year or next; Sendero, in classic Maoist fashion, intends to wait until it is in firm control of the countryside. Meanwhile, it will continue to lay the groundwork for insurrection in Lima by making the city ungovernable through mass organizing and violence. If current trends con-tinue, RAND's McCormick predicts the final campaign against Lima will begin "sometime within the next five years."[^39]

### Future Imperfect

The near and medium-term prospects for Peru are grim. Fujimori and the generals have embarked on a Pinochet-style process of authoritarian modernization with fascistic over-tones. This trend is evidenced by Fujimori's resort to "democracy by plebiscite," his pseudo-populist appeals, and his ongoing effort to eliminate political institutions standing between him and a "leader-masses" politics. While interna-tional support, or at least acquiescence, is probably assured as long as movement toward a new constitutional order continues, Fujimori begins with an extremely weak social and political base.

The self-coup dealt a hard blow to the political opposition, especially the re-energized APRA, which led the opposition bloc and threatened to hamstring both the economic program and an unbridled counterinsurgency. Since the coup, Fujimori has tried to eliminate new challenges from the political sector by issuing decrees mandating stiff prison terms for those "usurping public functions or the power to give orders to the military," a clear slap at efforts to use the constitution to restore the *status quo ante*.[^40] But Fujimori's lack of a firm political base requires that he move toward accommodation with the political opposition. And with Sen-dero waiting in the wings, unity within the elite is imperative.

The most likely resolution of the political crisis is a new, more repressive institutional order negotiated between Fuji-mori and the opposition and validated by an electorate pre-sented with no other choices. If this process reaches fruition, it would restore the tattered facade of democracy and renew Fujimori's legitimacy. Progress, however, has been slow since the coup. Fujimori's promised "national dialogue" be-tween the regime and the political parties has been repeatedly postponed as both sides maneuver for maximum advantage. A plebiscite on the coup, originally set for July 5, 1992, has also been postponed, with the regime explaining that it needs time to put the electoral machinery in place. Now set for November 22, the poll, instead of a mandate on the coup, has been transformed into elections for a constituent assembly to rewrite the currently suspended constitution.

Both Fujimori and the opposition parties are gearing up for the electoral struggle. This process will, they hope, allow an end to the institutional impasse that has paralyzed the political war against Sendero. Meanwhile, the counterinsur-gency, under the control of the army, continues.[^41]

A political solution, however, does not address the fun-damental problems facing the country. There is no sign that the military's grip on real power will diminish; in fact, the opposite appears to be the case. The generals' weighty role in the current government gives them ample ability to ensure that the new order does not impede the struggle against Sendero. Indeed, the generals could remove Fujimori at any time they perceive their interests to be threatened.

### A Profound Chasm

Neither will a political solution address the huge chasm between the privileged elite and the disenfranchised mestizo-indigenous majority. For the latter—95 percent of the popula-tion—the right to vote means little if not joined with a real ability to effect change in their lives. Here again, Fujimori is a prisoner of his allies. Efforts to improve the economic situation of most Peruvians will run up against the neo-liberal designs of the business and international communities. If Fujimori loses their support, he becomes entirely the creature of the military and whatever mass appeal he can muster; that mass appeal is certain to diminish each day as Fujimori continues down the path of Fujishock.

Some on the left look to the "new social movements" as the germ of a new power, a basis on which to rebuild Peruvian society and politics. While the NSMs are indeed authentic grassroots organizations, they are less political movements than desperate mechanisms for survival for a whole stratum abandoned by the state. As such, they do not as much chal-lenge the regime as act as a safety valve for it. And as we have seen, these movements and the communities that gave birth to them are now the locus of the terrible pressures from all sides as Sendero's "people's war" takes aim at the capital. They are fracturing under the strain, joining the now dominant political trend in the country—polarization.

The legal left itself is shattering for the same reasons. As Sendero grows stronger and the political system self-destructs, a "third way" becomes less and less viable. The left's divisions are perhaps most clearly seen in the debate over the urban *rondas*, where some on the left have proposed a "broad front" of civil society and the state against Sendero. Others, arguing that it is the state itself, with its emiseration and oppression of the masses that feed Sendero, urge the creation of self-defense groups distinct from and even op-posed to the state.[^42] Since the coup, the democratic cover that sheltered the "broad front" approach has evaporated and the options now come down to being with the state or against it. And if not with the state, then with Sendero. The reformist middle is being squeezed out of existence.

Finally, there is Sendero Luminoso itself. The coup has done nothing to increase the state's ability to combat insur-gency. Paradoxically, by resorting to dictatorship, Fujimori has legitimized Sendero's position and played into its hands. Since the military already acted with virtual impunity before the coup, talk of unleashing the armed forces ignores the fact that they have been on the rampage for a decade with nothing to show for it but thousands of dead, missing, and imprisoned.

Another alternative, the "Argentine solution"—massive state terrorism—has so far not been tried in Peru, perhaps because the military realizes that, tempting as it may be, it is unlikely to eradicate Sendero. Instead, with the legal left and the popular organizations decimated by repression, Sendero would become the only haven for all those opposing the state. And even under this scenario, there is no guarantee that the state would emerge victorious. As the situation grows more desperate, the "Argentine solution" may become the final option in trying to stave off revolution.

Peru is trapped in a downward spiral of misery, social and political dissolution, and violence. It is the most extreme case in Latin America, but the combination of domestic elite rule and the imposition of the international neo-liberal economic order threaten the entire continent with the specter of "Peruvianization." Barring a radical transformation of Peruvian society—the establishment of authentic popular democracy dedicated to achieving social justice—Peru is doomed to continue a cycle of violent upheaval until either the military or the Maoists achieve total victory, or until the country collapses into anarchy. At this writing, it is difficult to see any basis for hope.

## Bush Inaugural Address Leaked to CovertAction

**By Edward S. Herman & Terry Allen**

(Image: Man's hands adjusting papers on a desk. Caption: Hard at work on the 1993 inaugural speech.)

Wading through the stack of presidential documents recently leaked to *CovertAction* by a secret source deep within the White House, we found what appears to be a draft of George Bush's 1993 inaugural address. Sources close to the president reveal that he has spent increasing amounts of time in seclusion working on this document, in anticipation of victory in November. Our handwriting expert has authenticated this draft and is "100 percent certain that it probably was written by George Bush himself."

*CovertAction* has asked Edward S. Herman to interpret this preview look inside the soul of the president, illuminate its deepest meaning, and give us some idea what to expect in the next four years.

M
y fellow Americans,[^1] I stand here before proud to accept the honor and challenge of my second term as President of the greatest nation on earth and leader of the Free World.[^2] In the first four years, we com-pleted our policy of containment,[^3] engineered a peaceful displacement of communism,[^4] and ushered in a New World Order.[^5]

In Central America, we helped install fledg-ling democracies[^6] whose governments regu-larly hold free elections.[^7] In Panama, we rid the hemisphere of a dangerous demagogue;[^8] in Nicaragua, which fell under the control of radi-cal-nationalists,[^9] we restored democracy; and in nearby Cuba, we continue to work toward neutralizing[^10] Fidel Castro.

Around the globe, especially in Eastern Eu-rope, we helped newly liberated peoples to see the benefits of the market[^11] and privatization.[^12]

B
ut I want to make it perfectly clear,[^13] that if we are to reduce inequality,[^14] eliminate the deficit,[^15] win the war on drugs,[^16] and rebuild our cities, our first step must be to cut the capital gains tax so that those most able to help the less fortunate will be able to do just that.

My fellow Americans, as we enter this, my second term as president, and march together, bound by common values,[^17] the United States of America will once again be an example to all the world. With God's help, we will internation-alize the thousand points of light and we will make them millions of glowing embers of democracy.[^18]

In closing, my fellow Americans, I pledge four more years of the same, only better.

## Refurbishing Special Operations for the 1990s

**By Louis Wolf**

(Image: USSOCOM logo)

The netherworld of covert op-erations contrasted ironically with the bland pastel and chrome sub-urban hotel which hosted a joint military-industrial con-ference on special operations, low-intensity conflict (SO/LIC), and drug interdiction.[^1] The tone of the meeting was set by the Navy's director of special warfare, Capt. Thomas Steffens. "The unconventional wars of the past," he told the attentive audience, "are the conventional wars of the future." The conference was evidence that SO/LIC, born under President Kennedy and discredited by the war in In-dochina, had been refurbished to fit the New World Order, as well as the needs of the military men and arms salesmen who would experience the protective attributes of a global giant that fulfills the promise of its revolutionary credo to the rights of mankind."[^2] Rather heady stuff.

(Image: U.S. Special Forces in action in one of almost three dozen countries.)

An internal discussion document circulated within the Betac Corporation is more graphic. "The planned and crisis action role of U.S. defense forces of the 1990s and beyond will be focused on direct action, LIC, other special operations, and short-term regional intervention with light, conventional forces whenever critical U.S. security interests are threatened."[^3]

Betac, like many of the corporations which sent repre-sentatives to the May conference, had reason to look on the increased emphasis on SO/LIC with pleasant anticipation. The 15-year old company designs intelligence, counterintelligence, and communi-cations architectures, special operations, and low-intensity conflict options, command and control systems, tactical deception programs, and security engineering which it sells to the Pentagon and to the huge military-civilian intel-ligence community.

### Staking Out Turf

The executive branch has initiated and the Congress has acquiesced to the formal bureau-cratization of a whole new structure at the Pen-tagon to promote SO/LIC. This agenda was launched in April 1987 by the creation of the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) based at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida, and by the October 1989 appointment of an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict—now James R. Locher, III. Since August 1991, Locher's "special assistant" has been Robert "Gene" Gately, who joined the CIA in 1955 and worked in Japan and Thailand.[^4]

This increased power of the military in the SO/LIC opera-tional sphere has not gone unnoticed by the CIA, which considers such activities part of its turf. In a 1991 speech to CIA employees, "The Future of American Intelligence," Di-rector of Central Intelligence Robert Gates staked his ter-ritorial claim. "[A] task force is addressing how to improve CIA support for military operations, coordination of certain military intelligence activities, and overall CIA-military working relationships. This could involve appointment of a flag rank officer as a second Associate Deputy Director of Operations." On March 5, 1992, Gates named Army Maj. Gen. Roland Lajoie to the new post, and a parallel Office of Military Affairs was created concurrently.[^5]

The Pentagon has traditionally filled a handful of high executive slots at the CIA, as well as the directorship of the National Security Agency. Gates's appointment of Maj. Gen. Lajoie as immediate deputy to 31-year CIA veteran Deputy Director for Operations Thomas Alan Twetten, however, indicates that the progression of military involvement in and direction of special operations is already far advanced. One of the CIA's own elite components under the Directorate of Operations is the Special Operations Group (SOG).[^6] The ascension of Lajoie at this time also underlines the fact that Gates is seeking to assuage both the Pentagon special opera-tions brass, and their allies in Congress, while trying to keep the CIA in charge of the unfolding process.

### Big Bucks for Special Ops

And that will cost money—at a time when the end of the Cold War and a devastated economy have meant budget cuts. The White House has continued to rely on covert operations and regional warfare. Bush increased his request to Congress from $3.1 to $3.4 billion for Fiscal Year 1993 to fund USSOCOM research, development, testing and evaluation, sys-tems procurement, intelligence, naval and aviation programs, and classified activities.[^7] Smiling broadly, Army Col. Dave Bryan, of Gen. Colin Powell's Joint Chiefs of Staff J-6 support element, told those attending the SO/LIC conference, "Our budget is being slashed. But after all it's still a lot of money, isn't it?"

Among the areas undergoing major expansion are naval special warfare, aircrew training, avionics procurement, spe-cial reconnaissance, intelligence gathering systems, and making "interoperable" the ballooning inventory of special operations hardware. Aircraft, especially helicopters, have always been a favorite component of SO/LIC aggression and Pentagon spending reflects that priority. In addition to the Army's existing MC-130H and the Air Force's MC-AC-130U gunship and Combat Talon II aircraft, there are the MH-47E, MH-53J, and MH-60K "Black Hawk" helicopters, the newly-unveiled Sikorsky S-92 for Marine Corps lift-as-sault and Navy "vertical replenishment" missions, and ad-vanced delivery systems for the Navy's special operations forces, the SEALs.[^8] Another modified helicopter, the pre-cursor of which reportedly is already used in special warfare by SEALs, is the Boeing UH-46D "Sea Knight."[^9]

In order to ensure that the newly-invigorated special op-erations and low-intensity warfare infrastructure is fully em-powered and integrated into the immense Pentagon apparatus, SO/LIC CI (Command, Control, Communica-tions, Computers, and Intelligence) leaders are hard at work constructing an "architecture" to bolster "CI for the warrior ...[and to] snap forces together." Acknowledging endemic secrecy and compartmentalization, Col. Bryan complained about a "stovepipe environment," wherein data generated by the SO/LIC apparatus is too narrowly shared. Sounding like Marshall McLuhan in full-dress fatigues, Col. Bryan called for a "global infosphere [which would]...make the individual SOF soldier an information engineer."

The centrality of intelligence in the special operations landscape has precipitated "a policy dispute," acknowledges the General Accounting Office, "over which organization should have responsibility for oversight of all special opera-tions intelligence activities."[^10] "An option being looked at" to ameliorate the territorial squabbling is a joint intelligence center located at MacDill Air Force Base, which would include all services and military intelligence agencies as well as liaison with the civilian agencies.[^11]

### Going for the Hits

Although the "architecture" is being up-dated, the foundation remains sunk in the dirt of covert operations. Even the selective assas-sination projects, like the CIA's Operation Phoe-nix in Vietnam (headed by William Colby, Theodore Shackley, and Robert Komer), con-tinue to be supported and supplied in violation of presidential orders outlawing assassination. The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps are each busily augmenting their standing arsenals of offensive long-range sniper guns. The weapons being upgraded include the Army's Remington M-24 sniper rifle, now with flash suppression and silencer features, night-vision scopes, and a new touch—a "companion spot-ting scope" for a sniper's assistant.

(Image: Sentry stands watch at entrance of Colombia Revolutionary Army Force (FARC) base camp.)

Since 1988, the Army has taken delivery of 2,500 M-24s at $4,000 each. The Army, which used them "effectively" in Operations Just Cause (Panama) and Desert Storm (the Gulf), "is a satisfied customer," boasts Remington's Bill Forson.[^12] The Navy, under its new Sniper Security Program, and the Air Force both plan to use a modified M-14 rifle that USSOCOM's Major "Hawk" Holloway says "will be a lot more user-friendly," while the SEALs also employ the Reming-ton 700 and the MacMillan M-86 on antipersonnel missions, and are considering the Heckler and Koch MSG-90 rifle for urban sniping. Also in the works for SOF applications is a new offensive handgun by Colt and by Heckler and Koch, equipped with a silencer and laser aiming mechanism. This new weapon will supplement the 300,000 Beretta M-9 pistols (with 100,000 more in the pipeline) bought by the Pentagon since 1985.[^13] The Special Operations Research, Develop-ment, and Acquisition Center (SORDAC) is tasked continually by the various military services, as one Navy source told CAIB, to "get us the best."[^14]

It seems to be a never ending and grossly expensive quest which includes personnel as well as materiel. High on USSOCOM's priority list is increasing the number and geo-graphic range of special operations contingents in "forward presence" overseas. They work with the host military to establish "foreign internal defense." Presently, there are 2,000 SEALs including 60 16-person SEAL platoons, and 5,000 total naval special warfare personnel. SEAL units are now stationed abroad in Scotland, Panama, Guam, and until recently, the Philippines, as well as at home in Coronado, California; Puerto Rico; and Norfolk, Virginia.

The dark-suited corporate salesmen at the May conference busily peddled SO/LIC technology to their khaki counter-parts. Both groups seemed pleased at the degree to which elite special operators have been integrated into battle de-ployments. Capt. Thomas Steffens told listeners there were Navy SEALs aboard 39 ships during "Operation Desert Storm."[^15] Meanwhile, Bryan made the unsubstantiated claim that Saddam Hussein had seven million Italian-made mines.

(Image: Andy Messing, a "private ally" of Col. Oliver North.)

The sheer volume and growth of new drug detection and interdiction technology has created a "narco-industrial com-plex." The occasional large, high-profile drug bust in New York, Miami, or Los Angeles, or a much-publicized "hit" on a drug kingpin in Colombia, is good for easy publicity and political gain. They have not, however, ameliorated "the drug problem." Rather, the fight against narcotrafficking has more often been a useful mechanism to control recalcitrant foreign governments, shore up repressive regimes, and mask counterinsurgency campaigns.

### High-Intensity Devastation

This barely veiled delight in the manly adventure of war pervaded the conference and gave it a surreal air. The cold absurdity of the term "low-intensity conflict" lay grim and unremarkable like a corpse in a morgue. Certainly, the inten-sity was not "low" for those caught in the sights of this strategy which cost the lives of millions, from Vietnam to Nicaragua, the Philippines to Angola. Unnoticed, too, by those eagerly feeding at the LIC trough was the irony that when a new low-intensity warfare "master plan" was being fashioned in 1986, both the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed objections. They knew that in order to get the U.S. public to swallow the policy, they would have to sanitize it.

To this end, LIC proponents have offered a series of imaginative definitions incorporating military doublespeak and jargon-choked psychobabble. "Low-intensity conflict," intoned the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tiptoeing through the propaganda mine field, "is a limited politico-military strug-gle to achieve political, social, economic, or psychological motives....[It] is often protracted and ranges from diplomatic, economic, and psycho-social pressures through terrorism and insurgency, ....is often characterized by constraints on the weaponry, tactics, and level of violence... [and is] first, an environment in which conflict occurs and, second, a series of diverse civil-military activities and operations which are conducted in that environment. While low-intensity conflict may be ambiguous, the special activities are not."[^16] Right.

"The main objective," declaims another fan, "of both sides in low-intensity conflict is to influence the perceptions and loyalties of the civilian population. This may be achieved through persuasion or coercion but always with the goal of depriving the opponent of popular support."[^17]

"Low-intensity wars are all different," effused Edward Luttwak, an ardent hawk consultant to the Pentagon and State Department, "and each requires an ad hoc set of operational procedures... [and] one-time/one-place adaptive doctrines and methods."[^18]

Missing from the definitions, and indeed from the con-ference itself, was any mention of the high human costs or the inherent cowardice of a policy that seeks to blame its targets for the devastation it wreaks.

The corporate salesmen and beribboned brass alike were unconcerned about these ethical niceties. Rather, they saw the disappearance of the other superpower from the radar screen as an economic and military oppor-tunity. It was their fervid and unified hope that the burgeoning SO/LIC apparatus would quickly become a SO/LIC empire. That hope is fast becoming reality.

### Where They're Going From Here

Perhaps the most extraordinary revelations of the May 1992 conference came from Col. Gary Weber, the director of combat developments at the Army's John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He listed the special operations and low-inten-sity conflict future battlefield technologies under develop-ment and scheduled for completion between now and the year 2020, including:

*   Multi-spectral invisibility
*   Genetically-engineered biological electromagnet obscurant
*   Human sensory enhancement
*   Mechanical voice translator of other languages to English and vice versa (the Army studies 23 different languages)
*   Soft tissue regeneration
*   Whole blood replacement
*   Synthetic telepathy
*   Soft-kill weapons
*   Robotic weapons and mine systems
*   Directional explosive charges
*   High energy electromagnetic launchers
*   Directed energy weapons
*   Unmanned aerial resupply
*   Thermal imaging
*   Small lightweight tactical colorfax device
*   Miniaturized tactical radios
*   Hand-held laser radar to distinguish between men, women, and children
*   High-altitude cornucopia
*   Powered exoskeleton fitted brace to enable a parachutist to jump with 100 pounds of gear and protect their lower extremities from injury
*   Chameleonic battle dress to reduce U.S. signature

## Fluoride: Commie Plot or Capitalist Ploy

**By Joel Griffiths**

Cows crawled around the pasture on their bellies, inching along like giant snails. So crippled by bone disease they could not stand up, this was the only way they could graze. Some died kneeling, after giving birth to stunted calves. Others kept on crawling until, no longer able to chew because their teeth had crumbled down to the nerves, they began to starve....[^1]

These were the cattle of the Mohawk Indians on the New York-Canadian St. Regis Reservation during the pe-riod 1960-75, when industrial pollution devastated the herd—and along with it, the Mohawks' way of life. Crops and trees withered, birds and bees fled from this remnant of land the Mohawk still call Akwesasne, "the land where the par-tridge drums." Today, nets cast into the St. Lawrence River by Mohawk fishers bring up ulcerated fish with spinal de-formities. Mohawk children, too, have shown signs of dam-age to bones and teeth.[^2]

In 1980, the Mohawks filed a $150 million lawsuit for damage to themselves and their property against the com-panies responsible for the pollution: the Reynolds Metals Co. and the Aluminum Co. of America (ALCOA). But five years of legal costs bankrupted the tribe and they settled for $650,000 in damages to their cows; the court, however, left the door open for a future Mohawk suit for damage to their own health. After all, commented human rights lawyer Robert Pritchard, "What judge wants to go down in history as being the judge who approved the an-nihilation of the Indians by fluoride emissions?"[^3]

### Many Akwesasnes

Fluoride emissions? Fluoride, as in toothpaste?

Well, yes. Fluoride was the pol-lutant primarily responsible for the Akwesasne devastation.[^4]

For nearly 50 years, the U.S. government and media have been telling the public that fluoride is safe and beneficial—it is supposed to reduce cavities, especially in children. Manufacturers add it to toothpaste, municipalities put it in the public's drinking water. The only people who question the safety of fluoride, says the government, are quacks and lunatics—particularly of the far-right-wing variety.

But fluoride has another side the government never men-tions. It is a toxic industrial pollutant—one of the oldest and biggest of them all. For decades, U.S. industrial plants have rained heavy doses of waste fluoride on people, such as the Mohawks. The nation, however, has been successfully con-ditioned to think of fluoride solely as a benevolent substance and to dismiss as a crackpot, anyone who claims otherwise.

In recent years, because of rampant environmental dam-age, some of the worst fluoride pollution plants—such as those at Akwesasne—have been forced to reduce their emissions, but not terminate them. At Akwesasne, cows still live only half their normal lifespan. Nationwide, fluoride remains one of industry's largest pollutants. By the Environmental Protec-tion Agency's (EPA) last estimate, at least 155,000 tons a year were being released into the air by U.S. industrial plants.[^5] Emissions into water—lakes, rivers, and oceans—have been estimated to be as high as 500,000 tons a year.[^6]

While people living near and/or working in heavy fluoride-emitting industrial plants have received the highest doses, the general population has not been spared either. Fluoride is not biodegradable; what-ever comes around stays around, gradually accumu-lating in the environment, in the food chain, and in people's bodies, where it settles in bones and teeth.

If this general increase in fluoride dose were prov-ed harmful to humans, the impact on industry which pollutes both air and water would be major. The nation's air is contaminated by fluoride emissions from the production of iron, steel, aluminum, copper, lead and zinc; phosphates (essential for the manufac-ture of all agricultural fertilizers); plastics; gasoline; brick, cement, glass, ceramics, and the multitudinous other products made from clay; electrical power gen-eration and all other coal combustion; and uranium processing.[^7]

(Image: Dr. Strangelove, Capt. Jack D. Ripper (L.) in a scene from the movie, with Ripper asking "Have you ever seen a commie drink a glass of water?")

As for water, the leading industrial fluoride polluters are the producers and processors of glass, pesticides and fer-tilizers, steel and aluminum, chemicals, and metals. The metal processing industries include copper and brass, as well as titanium, superalloys, and refractory metals for military use.[^8]

The list of polluters extends across industry from basic to strategic. Industry and government have long had a powerful motive for claiming an increased dose of fluoride is safe for the population. Maintaining this position has not been easy because, of industry's largest pollutants, fluoride is by far the most toxic to vegetation, animals, and humans.[^9] In fact, it's one of the most toxic substances known.[^10]

"Airborne fluorides," reports the U.S. Department of Ag-riculture, "have caused more worldwide damage to domestic animals than any other air pollutant."[^11] As for vegetation, as early as 1901, studies "found that fluoride compounds are much more toxic than the other compounds that are of sig-nificance in the industrial smoke problem."[^12]

Fluoride pollution has caused aquatic damage of similar mag-nitude.[^13] In other words, there have been many Akwesasnes.

"Man [sic] is much more sensitive than domestic animals to fluoride intoxication [the medical term for poisoning]."[^14]

Evidence that industrial fluoride has been killing and crippling not only cows but human beings has existed at least since the 1930s. The government has not only dismissed the danger and left industry free to pollute, but it has promoted the intentional addition of fluoride—most of which is re-cycled industrial waste—to the nation's drinking water.

"It might be economically feasible to reduce industrial fluoride emissions further," says Fred L. Metz of the EPA's Office of Toxic Substances, "but eliminating them would probably be impossible."[^15]

### Primal Poison Threatens Industry

Of the highly toxic elements that are naturally present throughout the earth's crust—such as arsenic, mercury, and lead—fluoride is by far the largest in quantity.[^16] Normally, only minute amounts of these elements are found on the earth's surface, but industry mines its basic raw materials from deep in the earth and brings up vast tonnages—none in greater quantity than fluoride.

Historically, perhaps no other pollutant has posed a greater threat to industrial expansion. As early as 1850, fluoride emissions from the iron and copper industries poisoned crops, livestock, and people. By the turn of the century, consequent lawsuits and burdensome regulations threatened the existence of these in-dustries in Germany and England.[^17] They saved themselves by in-troducing the tall smoke-stacks which reduced damage by dispersing the fluorides and other toxins into the upper air.

(Image: Pro-fluoride pamphlet, American Assoc. of Public Health Dentistry.)

In twentieth century America, however, enormous industrial plants and new tech-nologies increased fluoride emissions so that even tall stacks could not prevent gross damage for miles around. Following the period of explosive in-dustrial expansion known as "industry's roaring 20s," the mag-nitude of industry's fluo-ride dilemma became starkly apparent.

International reports of fluoride damage mushroomed in 1933 when the world's first major air pollution dis-aster struck Belgium's Meuse Valley: several thousand people be-came violently ill and 60 died. The cause was disputed, but investigations by prominent scientists, including Kaj Roholm, the world's leading authority on fluoride hazards, placed the blame on fluoride.[^18]

Here and abroad, health scientists were beginning to re-gard fluoride as a poison, pure and simple. The trend toward its removal from the environment was potentially disastrous from industry's point of view. "Only recently, that is, within the last ten years, has the serious nature of fluoride toxicity been realized," wrote Lloyd DeEds, senior toxicologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1933. "It is a well-established fact that chronic intoxication [poisoning] may manifest itself in man as recognized abnormalities only after constant, or at least frequent, exposure over many years....The possibility of fluoride hazard should...be recog-nized in industry...where this element is discharged into the air as an apparently worthless by-product."[^19]

It was abundantly clear to both industry and government that spectacular U.S. industrial expansion—and the econom-ic and military power and vast profits it promised—would necessitate releasing millions of tons of waste fluoride into the environment. Furthermore, two large new industries would be adding to the dose: fluorocarbon chemicals (the aerosol propellants and refrigerants now depleting the ozone layer) and aluminum, slated for a crucial economic and military role during the upcoming Second World War. By 1938 the aluminum industry, which then consisted solely of ALCOA, had been placed on a wartime schedule. And fluoride was the aluminum industry's most devastating pollutant.[^20]

U.S. future industrial expansion, then, would be accom-panied by complaints and lawsuits over fluoride damage on an unprecedented scale—the most threatening aspect of which was harm to human health. Damage to animals and the environment might be tolerated and easily paid off; if, how-ever, serious injury to people were established, lawsuits alone could prove devastating to companies, while public outcry could force industry-wide government regulations, billions in pollution-control costs, and even mandatory changes in high-fluoride raw materials and profitable technologies.

### Liability Into Asset

This inter-war period saw the birth of the military-in-dustrial complex, with its concomitant public disinformation campaigns. It also saw a federal blitz campaign to convince the public fluoride was safe and good for them. The kick-off was the 1939 announcement by ALCOA-funded scientist Ger-ald J. Cox: "The present trend toward complete removal of fluoride from water and food may need some reversal."[^21]

New evidence of fluoride's safety began emerging from research centers plied with industry's largess. Notable among these was the University of Cincinnati's Kettering Labo-ratory, whose specialty was investigating the hazards of industrial chemicals. Funded largely by top fluoride-emitters such as ALCOA, the Kettering Lab quickly dominated fluoride safety research. A book by Kettering scientist and Reynolds Metals consultant E.J. Largent, for example, written in part to "aid industry in lawsuits arising from fluoride damage," became a basic international reference work.[^22]

The big news in Cox's announcement was that this "ap-parently worthless by-product" had not only been proved safe (in low doses), but actually beneficial: it might reduce cavi-ties in children. A proposal was in the air to add fluoride to the entire nation's drinking water. While the dose to each individual would be low, "fluoridation" on a national scale would require the annual addition of hundreds of thousands of tons of fluoride to the country's drinking water.

Government and industry—especially ALCOA—strongly supported intentional water fluoridation. Undoubtedly, most proponents were sincere in their belief that the procedure was safe and beneficial. At the same time, it might be noted that fluoridation made possible a master public relations stroke—one that could keep scientists and the public off fluoride's case for years to come. If the leaders of dentistry, medicine, and public health could be persuaded to endorse fluoride in the public's drinking water, proclaiming to the nation that there was a "wide margin of safety," how were they going to turn around later and say industry's fluoride pollution was dangerous?[^23]

As for the public, if fluoride could be introduced as a health-enhancing substance that should be added to the en-vironment for the children's sake, those opposing it would look like quacks and lunatics. The public would question attempts to point out its toxicity or its unsavory industrial connections.

### ALCOA Foils Accountability

With such a powerful spin operating, fluoride might be-come a virtually "protected pollutant,” as writer Elise Jerard later termed it.[^24] One thing is certain, the name of the com-pany with the biggest stake in fluoride's safety was ALCOA—whose name is stamped all over the early history of water fluoridation.

Throughout industry's "roaring 20s," the U.S. Public Health Service was under the jurisdiction of Treasury Secre-tary Andrew W. Mellon, a founder and major stockholder of ALCOA. In 1931, the year Mellon stepped down, a Public Health Service dentist named H. Trendley Dean was dis-patched to certain remote towns in the West where drinking-water wells contained high concentrations of natural fluoride from deep in the earth's crust. Dean's mission was to deter-mine how much fluoride people could tolerate without ob-vious damage to their teeth—a matter of considerable concern to ALCOA. Dean found that teeth in these high-fluoride towns were often discolored and eroded, but he also reported that they appeared to have fewer cavities than aver-age. He cautiously recommended further studies to determine whether a lower level of fluoride in drinking water might reduce cavities without simultaneously damaging bones and teeth, where fluoride settles in humans and other animals.

Back at the Mellon Institute, ALCOA's Pittsburgh industrial research lab, this news was galvanic. ALCOA-sponsored bio-chemist Gerald J. Cox immediately fluoridated some lab rats in a study[^25] and concluded that fluoride reduced cavities and that: "The case should be regarded as proved."[^26] In a historic moment in 1939, the first public proposal that the U.S. should fluoridate its water supplies was made—not by a doctor, or dentist, but by Cox, an industry scientist working for a company threatened by fluoride damage claims.[^27] Cox began touring the country, stumping for fluoridation.

Initially, many doctors, dentists, and scientists were cau-tious and skeptical, but then came World War II, during which industry's fluoride pollution increased sharply because of stepped-up production and the extensive use of ALCOA alumi-num in aircraft manufacture.

Following the war, as expected, hundreds of fluoride dam-age suits were filed around the country against producers of aluminum, iron and steel, phosphates, chemicals, and other major polluters.[^28] The cases settled in court involved only damage to livestock or vegetation.

### "Friends" of Children

Many others were settled out of court, including those claiming damage to human health, thus avoiding legal prece-dents. In one case, for the first time in the U.S. an Oregon federal court found in *Paul M. and Verla Martin v. Reynolds Metals* (1955) that the couple had sustained "serious injury to their livers, kidneys and digestive functions" from eating "farm produce contaminated by [fluoride] fumes" from a nearby Reynolds aluminum plant.[^29] Soon thereafter, no less than the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) and six other metals and chemical companies joined with Reynolds as "friends of the court" to get the decision reversed. Accord-ing to a local paper, a Reynolds attorney "contended that if allowed to stand, the verdict would become a ruling case, making every aluminum and chemical plant liable to damage claims simply by operating [emphasis added]."[^30] Despite extensive medical testimony for Reynolds from Kettering Lab scientists, the Martins kept on winning. Finally, in a time-honored corporate solution, Reynolds mooted the case by buying the Martins' ranch for a hefty price.

The postwar casualties of industrial fluoride pollution were many—from forests to livestock to farmers to smog-stricken urban residents—but they received little more than local notice. National attention had been diverted by fluo-ride's heavily publicized new image. In 1945, shortly before the war's end, water fluoridation abruptly emerged with the full force of the federal government behind it. In that year, two Michigan cities were selected for an official "15-year" comparison study to determine if fluoride could safely reduce cavities in children, and fluoride was pumped into the drink-ing water of Grand Rapids.

(Image: Image of a smiling mouse. Caption: After limited animal and human testing, the risks from fluoridation are cancer and bone disease; the possible benefit is a pretty smile.)

Other early experiments were performed, not only without publicity, but without the knowledge of the subjects. The scientific value of these experiments—and their ethics—were dubious in the extreme. In Massachusetts and Connec-ticut, for example, the first fluoridation experiments (1945-46) were conducted on indigent, mentally retarded children at state-run schools. According to the 1954 congres-sional testimony of Florence Birmingham, a trustee of the Wrentham (Massachusetts) State School for Feebleminded Children, her school's administration learned only by acci-dent that fluoride was being put in the drinking water.[^31]

The trustees immediately voted to stop the fluoridation, Birmingham testified, "but to my shocked surprise, we were told by the [Massachusetts Department of Health] that it was not an experiment and the fluoridation continued on.... I found in the files a letter revealing that [a health department representative] had come to the institution school and in a conference with administration officials warned them that there should be no publicity on the fluoride program there..."

The federally sanctioned experimenters did not seem con-cerned that these children might accidentally receive a toxic overdose of fluoride. "The method used in putting fluo-ride in the water," said the president of the school employees' union, "...is enough to cause panic at the institution.... A boy patient does it...He knows what it is for he said, 'Come up with me and I can show you how I can take care of you if I get mad at you.'"[^32]

Meanwhile, in 1946, despite the fact that the official 15-year experiment in Michigan had barely begun, six more U.S. cities were allowed to fluoridate their water. The fluoridation bandwagon had begun to roll.

At this juncture, Oscar R. Ewing, a long-time ALCOA lawyer who had recently been named the company's chief counsel—with fees in the then-astronomical range of $750,000 a year[^33]—arrived in Washington. Ewing was presumably well aware of ALCOA's fluoride litiga-tion problem. He had handled the company's negotia-tions with the government for the building of its wartime plants.[^34]

In 1947, Ewing was appointed head of the Federal Security Agency (later HEW), a position that placed him in charge of the Public Health Service (PHS). Under him, a national water fluoridation campaign rap-idly materialized, spearheaded by the PHS. Over the next three years, 87 additional cities were fluoridated including the control city in the original two-city Michi-gan experiment, thus wiping out the most scientifically objective test of safety and benefit before it was half over.

### The Father of All Spin Doctors

The government's official reason for this unscientific haste was "popular demand." And indeed, these 87 cities had become so wild for fluoridation that the government claimed it wasn't fair to deny them the benefits. By then, in fact, much of the nation was clamoring for fluoridation. This enthusiasm was not really surprising, considering Oscar Ewing's public relations strategist for the water fluoridation campaign was none other than Sigmund Freud's nephew Edward L. Ber-nays, "The Original Spin Doctor," as a *Washington Post* headline recently termed him.[^35] Bernays, also known as the "father of public relations," pioneered the application of his uncle's theories to advertising and government propaganda. The government's fluoridation campaign was one of his most stunning and enduring successes.

In his 1928 book *Propaganda*, Bernays explained "the structure of the mechanism which controls the public mind, and how it is manipulated by the special pleader [i.e., public relations counsel] who seeks to create public acceptance for a particular idea or commodity...."[^36] "Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country...our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of....."

"If you can influence the [group] leaders," wrote Bernays who had many confidential industrial clients, "either with or without their conscious cooperation [emphasis added], you automatically influence the group which they sway..."[^37]

Describing how, as PR man for the Beech-nut Bacon Com-pany, he influenced leaders of the medical profession to promote sales, Bernays wrote, "The new salesman [would] suggest to physicians to say publicly that it is wholesome to eat bacon. He knows as a mathematical certainty that large numbers of persons will follow the advice of their doctors because he understands the psychological relationship of dependence of men on their physicians."[^38]

Substitute "dentists" for "physicians" and "fluoride" for "bacon" and the similarities are apparent. Almost overnight, under Bernays' mass mind-molding, the popular image of fluoride—which at the time was being widely sold as rat and bug poison—became that of a beneficial provider of gleam-ing smiles, absolutely safe, and good for children, bestowed by a benevolent paternal government. Its opponents were permanently engraved on the public mind as crackpots and right-wing loonies.

### Right-Wing Association

Fluoridation attracted opponents from every point on the continuum of politics and sanity. The prospect of the govern-ment mass-medicating the water supplies with a well-known rat poison to prevent a non-lethal disease flipped the switches of delusionals across the country—as well as generating concern among responsible scientists, doctors, and citizens.

Moreover, by a fortuitous twist of circumstances, fluo-ride's natural opponents on the left were alienated from the rest of the opposition. Oscar Ewing, as Federal Security Agency administrator, was a Truman "fair dealer" who pushed many progressive programs such as nationalized medicine. Fluoridation was lumped with his proposals. In-evitably, it was attacked by conservatives as a manifestation of "creeping socialism," while the left rallied to its support. Later during the McCarthy era, the left was further alienated from the opposition when extreme right-wing groups, includ-ing the John Birch Society and the Ku Klux Klan, raved that fluoridation was a plot by the Soviet Union and/or com-munists in the government to poison America's brain cells.

It was a simple task for promoters, under the guidance of the "original spin-doctor," to paint all opponents as de-ranged and they played this angle to the hilt. For example, one widely distributed dossier on opponents "listed in al-phabetical order reputable scientists, convicted felons, food faddists, scientific organizations, and the Ku Klux Klan."[^39]

Actually, many of the strongest opponents originally start-ed out as proponents, but changed their minds after a close look at the evidence. And many opponents came to view fluoridation not as a communist plot, but simply as a capi-talist-style con job of epic proportions. Some could be termed early environmentalists, such as the physicians George L. Waldbott and Frederick B. Exner, who first documented government-industry complicity in hiding the hazards of fluoride pollution from the public. Waldbott and Exner risked their careers in a clash with fluoride defenders, only to see their cause buried in toothpaste ads.

Exner's voluminous files were a source of pivotal evi-dence in lawsuits decided against industry and against fluo-ridation promoters. In 1978, following his death, his files were destroyed in a mysterious fire.[^40]

But all the opponents, credible and cracked alike, were run over by the fluoridation bandwagon. In 1950 the Public Health Service, along with leaders of dentistry, medicine, and practically everything else, officially endorsed fluoridation, and the transformation of fluoride's image was complete. Since then, two-thirds of the nation's reservoirs have been fluoridated, and about 143,000 tons of fluoride are pumped in yearly to keep them that way.[^41] Meanwhile, the govern-ment continues to campaign for "universal fluoridation."

Which brings us to the last benefit to industry from fluo-ridation: Companies forced to reduce their emission can recoup some of the expense by selling the waste to cities for water fluoridation. And most of the fluoride added to drink-ing water has been recycled waste, particularly from the fertilizer industry.[^42]

### Protected Pollutant

Since the 1950s, fluoride as industrial toxin has remained largely unknown to the public, replaced by fluoride as child-ren's friend and creator of beautiful smiles. The 1930s trend toward its removal from the environment has been reversed with a vengeance. For example, in 1972 the newly formed EPA did a survey of atmospheric fluoride polluters. It found that five of the top six typically didn't bother to control their fluoride emissions at all and weren't measuring emissions.[^43] The most lax was the iron and steel industry, which, accord-ing to the report, was also the biggest fluoride emitter.[^44]

And why should these industries worry, as regulatory agencies have maintained—ever since water fluoridation—that industrial fluoride emissions are harmless to humans? As the EPA report stated: "The fluorides currently emitted [by industry] may damage economic crops, farm animals, and materials of decoration [i.e., flowers and ornamental plants] and construction [i.e. buildings, statuary and glass]...

"...[H]owever, the potential to cause fluoride effects in man is negligible."[^45] Or, as another EPA report puts it, "It is clear that fluoride emissions from primary aluminum plants have no significant effect on human health. Fluoride emis-sions, however, do have adverse effects on livestock and vegetation."[^46] In other words, the stuff withers plants, crip-ples cows, and even eats holes in stone, but it doesn't hurt people. Nature ever surprises.

When it comes to water pollution, of course, industry has even less reason to fear conviction for damage to human health. The government's fluoridation studies have suppos-edly established beyond a doubt that hundreds of thousands of tons of fluoride a year can be poured directly into the nation's drinking water supplies with a "wide margin of safety" for humans. So industrial fluoride emitters only have to worry about the fish when they poison nearby bodies of water. The same concentrations added to human drinking water for cavity prevention can be fatal to freshwater fish.[^47]

### Polluted Science

When new scientific evidence threatens fluoride's pro-tected pollutant status, the government immediately appoints a commission, typically composed of several veteran fluoride defenders and no opponents; usually, these commissions dismiss the new evidence and reaffirm the status quo. When one didn't in 1983, the government simply altered the find-ings. It's an instructive tale.

In 1983, the Public Health Service convened a panel of "world-class experts" to conduct a *pro forma* review of safety data on fluoride in drinking water. A panel transcript of the private deliberations revealed its members discovering that much of the vaunted evidence of fluoride's safety barely existed.[^48] The 1983 panel recommended caution, especially in regard to fluoride exposure for children,[^49] but its chair, Jay R. Shapiro, then with the National Institutes of Health, was aware that recommendations which conflicted with govern-ment fluoride policy might run into trouble. In an attached memo, Shapiro remarked, "[B]ecause the report deals with sensitive political issues which may or may not be acceptable to the PHS [Public Health Service], it runs the risk of being modified at a higher level...."[^50]

Shapiro was prescient. When Surgeon General Everett Koop's office released the official report a month later, the panel's most important conclusions and recommendations had been thrown out, apparently without consulting its mem-bers. "When contacted," wrote Daniel Grossman, "...mem-bers of the panel assembled by the Public Health Service expressed surprise at their report's conclusions: They never received copies of the final altered-version. EPA scientist Edward Ohanian, who observed the panel's deliberations, recalled being 'baffled' when the agency received its report."[^51]

All the government's alterations were in one direction and any conclusion suggesting low doses of fluoride might be harmful was thrown out. In its place, the government sub-stituted this blanket statement: "There exists no directly applicable scientific documentation of adverse medical ef-fects at levels of fluoride below 8 ppm [parts per million]."[^52]

This contradicted the panel's final draft, which firmly recommended that "the fluoride content of drinking water should be no greater than 1.4-2.4 ppm for children up to and including age 9 because of a lack of information regarding fluoride effect on the skeleton in children (to age 9), and potential cardiotoxic effects [heart damage]..."[^53] All that, and more, was tossed out by the government.

To quote from the transcript of the panel's meeting:
Dr. Wallach: "You would have to have rocks in your head, in my opinion, to allow your child much more than 2 ppm."
Dr. Rowe: "I think we all agree on that."[^54]

But in 1985, basing its action on the altered report issued by Surgeon General Koop, EPA raised the amount of fluoride allowed in drinking water from 2 to 4 ppm for children and everybody else.

### Bones of Contention

What are the effects of the decades-long increase in fluo-ride exposure on the nation's health? The best answer is, given the size and pervasiveness of the motive for bias and the extreme politicization of science on this question, no one knows. Recently, scientists have taken a new look, especially at the most likely place to find fluoride damage: human bones, where it accumulates. In the past two years, eight epidemiological studies by apparently disinterested scien-tists have suggested that water fluoridation may have in-creased the rate of bone fractures in females and males of all ages across the U.S.[^55] The latest study published in the *Journal of the American Medical Association* (JAMA) found that "low levels of fluoride may increase the risk of hip fracture in the elderly."[^56]

These results, if correct, would also implicate industrial fluoride pollution. Another group likely to show damage from fluoride is young males. Since 1957, the bone fracture rate among male children and adolescents has in-creased sharply in the U.S. ac-cording to the National Center for Health Statistics.[^57] The U.S. hip fracture rate is now the highest in the world, reports the National Research Council.[^58] "... Clearly," wrote JAMA in an editorial, "it is now appropriate to revisit the issue of water fluoridation."[^59]

Fluoride and cancer, too, have been linked by the govern-ment's own animal carcinogenicity test.[^60] Evidence that fluo-ride is a carcinogen has cropped up since at least the 1940s, but the government has dismissed it all. A 1956 federal study found nearly twice as many bone defects (of a type con-sidered possibly pre-malignant) among young males in the fluoridated city of Newburgh, New York, as compared with the unfluoridated control city of Kingston; this finding, how-ever, was considered spurious and was not followed up.[^61] For a long time, the government avoided performing its official animal carcinogenicity test—which, if positive, would re-quire regulatory action against fluoride. It had to be pushed into doing that.

In 1975, John Yiamouyiannis, a biochemist and controver-sial fluoridation opponent, and Dean Burk, a retired National Cancer Institute (NCI) official, reported a 5 to 10 percent increase in total cancer rates in U.S. cities which had fluori-dated their water supplies.[^62] Whether scientifically valid or not, the paper did trigger congressional hearings in 1977, at which it was revealed, incredibly, that the government had never cancer-tested fluoride. Congress ordered the NCI to begin.

Twelve years later, in 1989, the study was finally com-pleted. It found "equivocal evidence" that fluoride caused bone cancer in male rats. The NCI was immediately di-rected to examine cancer trends in the U.S. population that might be fluoride-related. The NCI found that nationwide evidence "...of a rising rate of bone and joint cancer at all ages combined, due mainly to trends under the age of 20, was seen in the 'fluoridated' counties but not in the 'non-fluoridated' coun-ties....The larger increase in males under the age of 20 seen in the aggregate data for all bone and joint cancers is seen only in the 'fluoridated' coun-ties."[^63]

The NCI also did more detailed studies focused on several counties in Washington and Iowa. Once again, "When re-stricted to percent under the age of 20, the rates of bone and joint cancer in both sexes rose 47 percent from 1973-80 to 1981-87 in the fluoridated areas of Washington and Iowa and declined 34 percent in the non-high fluoridated areas. For osteosarcomas [bone cancers] in males under 20 [emphasis added], the rate increased 70 percent in the fluoridated areas and decreased four percent in the non-fluoridated areas."[^64] But after applying sophisticated statistical tests, the NCI concluded that these findings, like those in Newburgh in 1956, were spurious.

It was commission time again.

The new commission, chaired by venerable fluoridation proponent and U.S. Public Health Service official Frank E. Young, concluded in its final report that "...its year-long investigation has found no evidence establishing an associa-tion between fluoride and cancer in humans." As for the evidence on bone fractures, the commission merely stated, "further studies are required." And finally, as always: "The U.S. Public Health Service should continue to support op-timal fluoridation of drinking water."[^65]

"If fluoride presents any risks to the public at the levels to which the vast majority of us are exposed," intoned U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health, James G. Mason, when releas-ing the report, "those risks are so small that they have been impossible to detect. In contrast, the benefits are great and easy to detect."[^66] That is, fewer cavities in children.

### Government Doubts

There are signs, however, that 50 years of official unanim-ity on this subject may be disintegrating. Referring to the government's animal study, James Huff, a director of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, told a 1992 meeting he believes "that the reason these animals got a few osteosarcomas [bone cancers] was because they were given fluoride... Bone is the target organ for fluoride." In other words, the findings not "equivocal" but solid.

"Perhaps we need to learn more about this chemical," said Huff.[^67]

Others feel more than enough has already been learned. William Mar-cus, an EPA senior science adviser and toxicologist was indignant. "In my opinion," he said, "fluoride is a carcinogen by any standard we use. I believe EPA should act immediately to protect the public, not just on the cancer data, but on the evidence of bone fractures, arthritis, mutagenicity and other effects." Marcus adds that a still-unreleased study by the New Jersey State Health Department has found that the bone cancer rate is six times higher—among young males—in fluoridated communities.[^68]

"The level of fluoride the government allows the public is based on scientifically fraudulent information and altered reports,"[^69] charges Robert Carton, an EPA environmental sci-entist and past president of its employee union, Local 2050, National Federation of Federal Employees. The EPA union has been campaigning for six years against what it terms the "politicization of science" at the agency, citing fluoride as the archetypal case. "People can be harmed simply by drink-ing the water," Carton warns.[^70]

A subcommittee headed by Congressman Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) is investigating the government's handling of the evi-dence on fluoride's safety. And there the matter rests—until the next commission.

### Mega-con

Does fluoridation reduce cavities in children? Almost everyone feels certain that it does, but only because trusted authorities have told them so, and those authorities in turn received their information from leaders who, as the original spin-doctor noted, must be influenced if you want to make the public believe something.

Actually, over the years, many health professionals—especially abroad—have decided the beneficial effects of fluoride are mostly hokum; but open debate has been stifled—if not strangled. Repeatedly dentists and doctors who were regarded as paragons of professional excellence—when they supported fluoride—have been vilified and professionally ostracized after they changed their minds. During the early 1980s, New Zealand's most prominent fluoridation advocate was John Colquhoun, the country's chief dental officer. Then he decided to gather some results. "I was an ardent fluorida-tionist, you see. I wanted to show people how good it was..."

"When as chair of the Fluorida-tion Promotion Committee, I gath-ered these statistics... I observed that...the percentage of children who were free of dental decay was higher in the unfluoridated part of most health districts in New Zea-land."[^71] The national health depart-ment refused to allow Colquhoun to publish these findings, and he was encouraged to resign.

Now Colquhoun writes that "new evidence...suggests that the harmful effects of water fluoridation are more real than is general-ly admitted while the claimed dental benefit is negligible."[^72]

A more recent example is Canadian physician Richard G. Foulkes, who is currently being accused by his former col-league, Brent Friesen, chief medical officer of Calgary, B.C., of "a classical case of manipulation of information and selec-tive use...to promote the quackery of anti-fluoridationists."

In 1973, as a special consultant to the health minister of British Columbia, Foulkes had authored a report recommend-ing mandatory fluoridation for the province. But, after re-viewing the evidence, he has concluded that "fluoridation of community water supplies can no longer be held to be safe or effective in the reduction of tooth decay.... Even in 1973, we should have known this was a dangerous chemical."[^73] He adds that "there is, also, a not-too-subtle relationship between the objective [the promotion of fluoridation] and the needs of major industries..."[^74]

"I was conned," Foulkes thinks, "by a powerful lobby."[^75]

## What Vice President Bush Knew and Why He Knew It

**By Anthony L. Kimery**

"What is striking about George Bush's role as Vice President is that he was much more than has ever been sus-pected. [In the Iran-Contra operation, he]...actually helped execute the dirty-tricks schemes that hijacked Congress's prerogatives in the 1980s," wrote Frank Snepp and Jonathan Marshall.[^1] Bush was in the big middle of the Reagan administration's covert operations; not just as a yes man to Reagan, but as an ardent supporter of, and facilitator for, the CIA and the covert operations crowd at Langley and the Old Executive Office Building. That involvement but-tresses emerging evidence that Bush has been connected to the clandestine services for nearly four decades.[^2]

(Image: Caricature of George Bush with multiple arms, each holding a different object: money, gun, CIA logo, etc.)

From his early days at Yale in the 1940s, when he was a member of the Agency-linked Skull and Bones Soci-ety, to his career as a moderately suc-cessful Texas businessman in the 1950s and early 1960s, to his stint as a political player in the 1960s and 1970s, Bush has been unofficially linked to the CIA in one way or another. In 1976, when Bush became head of the Agency, the connection came into the open and stayed un-usually close through his term as Vice President. Bush or-chestrated CIA covert activities employed by the Reagan administration to achieve its foreign policy objectives—the same ones Bush had a heavy hand in designing.[^3]

In 1981, when CIA Director William Casey first laid out his plan to launch a secret war against the Sandinista gov-ernment, Bush eagerly supported the scheme. And for good reason: It was drafted by his longtime friend, CIA ca-reer officer Donald Gregg, who was the Agency's man on the National Security Council (NSC) and who arranged for an expansion of Bush's role in the plan-ning and approval of covert opera-tions.[^4] Shortly after Casey's plan was adopted by the White House, Bush ap-pointed Gregg his National Security Adviser. Resigning from the Agency in 1979 to sever the official link, Gregg began in 1981 to manage the Contra supply effort that Oliver North was run-ning from the NSC.[^5] By this time, Bush was a member of the NSC, the National Security Planning Group, the Task Force on Combatting Terrorism, and chair of the White House Special Situations Group.

From then on, Bush attended nearly every key meeting concerning Iran-Contra, signed off on early deliveries of arms to the Contras, helped organize a resupply bridge to Contra bases in Honduras, sent members of his staff into the field to write progress reports, and helped stage-manage the Israelis' central role in arming the Contras and brokering the initial arms sales to Iran.[^6]

Given his hands-on approach, institutional centrality, and personal involvement, Bush's contention that he was out of "the loop" is elementally ludicrous. In a recently surfaced 1987 memo, then-Secretary of State George Shultz and then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger expressed incredu-lity at Bush's assertion that he was unaware that the two cabinet members had opposed the Iran arms sales to fund the Contras. "He [Bush] was on the other side [of the debate]. Its on the Record," the memo noted recording Shultz's anger. "Why did he say that."[^7]

Why indeed. The nature of Bush's involvement and that of his office in the Contra war was so intimate, that a coverup was bound to fail, but not without buying Bush enough time to be elected once, and possibly twice to the presidency.

A key link was Donald Gregg, Bush's national security adviser. Gregg oversaw the operation through his trust-ed friend Félix Rodríguez, a Cuban-American career CIA operative who first linked up with the Agency during its war against Fidel Castro. According to some accounts, Gregg specifi-cally pitched the idea of putting Rodríguez in charge on the ground in Central America, to which Bush re-plied: "This sounds like a good idea. See if you can arrange it."[^8]

(Image: John Poindexter, another Reagan National Security Adviser.)

Since Rodríguez reported to Gregg and met on several occasions with Bush,[^9] it is not surprising that Bush's office was one of the first places no-tified when, on October 5, 1986, Nica-raguan soldiers shot down a cargo plane trying to drop weapons to the Con-tras. Onboard were ex-CIA opera-tives working for the White House, including Eugene Hasenfus, the sole survivor of the shoot-down. Orchestra-ted denials, particularly by Bush's of-fice, and frenetic high-level "spin controls" began immediately. Until forced to recant by the weight of incon-trovertible evidence, the White House stonewalled. "There is no government connection with that plane at all," Reagan declared;[^10] the aircraft was part of a private Contra supply operation, Shultz and Assistant Secretary Elliot Abrams claimed.[^11]

### Indictments and More Lies

The extent and nature of that protection involved an ela-borate fabric of both legal lies to the public and illegal lies to the Congress. This screen served to distance Vice President Bush from the mess—until Tuesday, July 9, 1991. That morn-ing, the first of many indictments against former CIA offi-cials was handed down by Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh who was conducting what would become a five-and-a-half year inves-tigation.

It was then that Alan D. Fiers, chief of the CIA's Central America Task Force (1984-88), pleaded guilty to ly-ing to Congress when he testified that "we do not know" whose airplane was shot down or "who was behind the flights."[^12] Fiers told Congress that the CIA, like Bush, had been out of the loop. Significantly, Fiers stated he was ordered to lie by Clair George, his su-perior at the Agency. He also admitted knowing that George planned to lie in his testimony to Congress. When Fiers presented George with a suggested opening statement explaining the Hasenfus flight as an unfortunate aber-ration from the legal "humanitarian" aid flights, George rejected admitting any administration connection to the downed flight. "No," testified Fiers quoting George's response, "I [George] don't want that....It puts the spotlight on the White House, Ollie North or the administration....I don't want to be the first person to do that," a weeping Fiers testified in George's trial. (Emphasis added.)[^13] Nearly a year earlier, Fiers had testified that George had told him "this was a State [Department]-White House operation."[^14]

This high-level coverup is important not only because it hid facts, but because it disguised a ---

### What Bush Knew and Why He Knew It (Continued)

This high-level coverup is important not only because it hid facts, but because it disguised a trail that might—had the truth been impossible for congressional investigators to dismiss—have led to George. Bush.[^15]

### Following the Trail to Bush

That trail is dotted with the intersecting footprints of Donald Gregg, Félix Rodríguez, a.k.a. Max Gomez, G. Philip Hughes (the vice president's deputy national security adviser), and George Bush. From 1984 to 1986, Fiers dealt directly with Gregg, notably in matters concerning Rod-ríguez—a key manager of the Contra operation. Fiers' testi-mony strongly contradicts Gregg's claim that he did not know what North was up to.[^16] The connection between Bush and Rodríguez is less intimate, but also long-standing. Having earned Bush's loyalty somewhere along the line, perhaps during the Agency's anti-Castro exploits, Rodrí-guez met with the vice president sev-eral times at the White House and received his blessing for the anticom-munist quest.[^17] In a January 6, 1986, entry in his personal notebook, Oliver North reported that Fiers had expressed concern that "Félix [was] talking too much about VP connection...."

Rodríguez's part in the Contra sup-ply operation was truly an explosive matter that the CIA and the White House were particularly intent on keep-ing secret. As Fiers' former legislative and legal adviser Louis Dupart has tes-tified, the CIA hid Rodríguez's role in resupplying the Contras. The CIA even continued to conceal what it knew about Rodríguez after Fiers and George acknowledged to Congress that Max Gomez and Félix Rodríguez were one and the same.[^18] Meanwhile, Bush and Gregg have stonewalled all along, maintaining their ignorance of North's network until it was publicly acknowledged by Attorney General Edwin Meese in November 1986.

In fact, the vice president knew pre-cisely what was going on with the Contras. His office was the central command post and he, Gregg, and Hughes were deeply involved.[^19] Fiers has testified that he met with Gregg to discuss Rodríguez's charges that the resupply network was raking off considerable profits.[^20] A nearly identical charge had been made by another Contra supply operative, former Air Force Col. Richard B. Gadd in sworn testimony on behalf of a damage lawsuit brought by Eugene Hasenfus. Gadd stated that Robert Dutton, another key participant in the supply operation who worked closely with Richard Secord, told him in 1986 that Bush had discussed supply problems with Rodríguez, including selling "cheap parts or inadequate ammunition" to the Contras.[^21] Included in Dutton's tes-timony before the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, were NSC memos con-taining Rodríguez's alias.[^22]

Throughout 1985 and 1986, Hughes also met with North and his name turns up in the North notebooks as early as July 1984. Hughes was also involved in a 1985 incident in which Bush put an allegedly CIA-tied Contra supporter in touch with North.[^23]

### George and Twetten Fudge the Truth

In his summer 1992 mistrial for nine felony counts of lying and obstructing congressional and grand jury investi-gations, George charged the Senate in-vestigators with "hypocrisy." And there is some truth to his claim that it was an "open secret in Washington," and a well-documented truism in the left media, that the resupply effort was an official (albeit covert), illegal U.S. operation.

Rodríguez's role, for example, was well understood. George, however, stonewalled the Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee by denying the cen-trality of the CIA connection—through Rodríguez—to the White House opera-tion in Central America. His lawyers presented scores of cables identifying Rodríguez—including several that had arrived at the CIA headquarters just days before the hearing—and exposing George's and Fiers' lies to the committee. Even George's CIA briefing book, prepared for his Senate testimony by Fiers, contained two pages on Rodríguez and incorporated informa-tion from a CIA cable that came the night before he appeared in front of the lawmakers. The denial nevertheless served to placate the nervous congresspeople.

Six years after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) testified at George's trial, and accused George of lying to the committee. At the time, Kerry said, all that was known was that Hasenfus was claim-ing to work for the CIA and that "Max Gomez" was in charge. If the CIA had come clean about Rodríguez and his connec-tion to Bush, Kerry told the jury, "you would have had a totally different attitude in the Congress" toward the $100 million Contra aid package then being debated. The bill was passed by Senate and House conferees the same day George testified.[^24]

Fiers and George aren't the only ones implicated in not being truthful with Congress. Thomas Twetten, 31-year CIA veteran, appointed by Bush in 1990, is still CIA Deputy Director for Operations. During Iran-Contra, he was chief of the Near East Division and handled the Agency's end of financing and logistics for the arms transfers to Iran. De-spite having been North's case officer at the CIA from 1985 to 1986, Twetten swore to Congress that he knew nothing about the diversion of profits from arms sales in Iran to the Contras. This claim was repeated by his boss, Clair George. Twetten, who is also under investigation by Walsh,[^25] testified that although the circumstances of the arms sales were un-usual, his suspicions were not roused. Despite the gaping disparity between what the Iranians were charged for certain weapons and the CIA's cost, "It never occurred to me," Twetten said, "...that North was raking it off [for the Contras]. That was beyond the pale."[^26]

More important than what Twetten knew about the diversion of profits to the Contras, is what he knew about and whether he helped conceal the Bush- linked arms shipments to Iran prior to the initial officially-acknowledged delivery. Intelligence pro-vided by a high-level Iranian in Teheran (recruited by FBI counterintelligence to report on illegal arms shipments to Iran), clearly shows that arms were arriving in early Septem-ber 1985, two months before the CIA acknowledged involvement. At that time, the FBI began to receive accurate intelligence from its Iranian agent on U.S. arms shipments to Iran.[^27]

In 1985, when the Iranian began reporting that the arms were being flown into Teheran on U.S. registered aircraft, his FBI handler was bewildered. He turned for an explanation to his CIA liaison, a ranking officer in the Iranian branch of Twetten's operations division. Twetten told the CIA officer that it was "a White House operation," exactly what Fiers testified he had been told by George. The Agency man was ordered to tell his FBI counterpart not to report the Iranian's information to anyone in the FBI. "In other words, I was being told to cover it up," the ex-CIA officer says. Allegedly, Twetten gave the order to suppress the affair and alter all related memos prepared by the CIA liaison.[^28]

Classified CIA documents later confirmed that "high quality intelligence on U.S. arms shipments to Iran," prior to those which have officially been acknowledged, were provided by "a Tel Aviv Station and a source at the arms delivery site in Teheran."[^29] This "high-level source [even] continued to report to the FBI" accurate information on the subsequent deliveries of arms that the Reagan White House later admitted to having sanctioned, the documents state. Some of the earlier arms, the source told the FBI, were delivered by Arrow Air, a charter airline with strong ties to the CIA that not only made half-a-dozen deliveries of arms to the Contras, but also flew for AmeriCares, a shadowy disaster relief organization founded by Robert McCauley, a lifelong close friend of George Bush and Prescott Bush, Jr., George's brother.[^30]

### AmeriCares, Contras, and the Knights of Malta

AmeriCares may have been even more intimately impli-cated in the resupply effort by Fiers' August 1992 testimony. In his testimony at the George trial, former Central American Task Force Chief Fiers admitted helping late CIA Director William Casey defy congressional restrictions by funneling money to the Contras through Nicaraguan Archbishop Mi-guel Obando y Bravo. The pro-Contra cleric received the funds, said Fiers, through a company that "did a great deal of work for us [the CIA] in lots of different ways."[^31]

Circumstantial evidence points to AmeriCares as a prob-able suspect. In 1985 and 1986, AmeriCares flew shipments of "humanitari-an" aid to both the archbishop and to the Contra organization run by Mario Calero, brother of Adolfo Calero. In 1988, the Nicaraguan government halt-ed some Ameri-Cares shipments backed by Vice President Bush. AmeriCares, Managua said, was a CIA front working with the North network.[^32]

An "informed source" at the *Washington Post* reported that W.R. Grace and Co.—which hired Fiers as a lobbyist when he resigned from the CIA—"was involved" in the plan to funnel aid to the church. Both Fiers, who still works there, and Grace officials vehemently denied the allegation. Nevertheless, AmeriCares did receive assistance from Ca-sey's longtime friend, J. Peter Grace, chair of W.R. Grace and Co. Grace, along with Prescott Bush, Jr., were AmeriCares founders. It was Grace whom Archbishop Obando y Bravo reportedly asked for help in the early 1980s to "thwart the Marxist-Leninist policies of the Sandinistas."[^33]

Grace's support would certainly have made a difference. Not only does he have long-standing ties to the CIA—not to mention major business interests in Central America—but he is president of the American Chapter of the Sovereign Mili-tary Order of Malta, a powerful Catholic organization, osten-sibly devoted to charitable works. In fact, it has a foreign policy and is accorded full diplomatic recognition by many countries. William Casey also was a member, as were and are many other CIA officials, past and present.[^34] Its Central American CIA links include Knights co-chair, Guatemalan businessman Roberto Alejos. In 1960, he had let the CIA use his plantations to train anti-Castro Cubans for the Bay of Pigs invasion; in the 1980s, he helped with AmeriCares' deliveries.[^35]

### Quid Pro Quo Foreign Policy

Elaborately covered tracks, webs of plausible deniability, false trails, and sturdy facades of misinformation are endemic haz-ards of efforts to disentangle CIA connections and operations. The ultimately futile stalling effort to distance Bush from the loop, and the carefully or-chestrated cam-paign to downplay his Agency connec-tions are in them-selves revealing. The weak links, however, show in-creasing strain. In November 1989, yet another CIA official, CIA Costa Rica Station Chief Joseph Fernandez, a.k.a. Tomas Castillo, was indicted by Iran-Contra Inde-pendent Counsel Walsh for lying to the CIA inspector general and the Tower Commission about his role in the CIA's illegal arms conduit to the Contras. Fernandez was intimately in-volved in the White House's Contra operation and dealt directly with Rodríguez in Rodríguez's capacity as its man-ager on the ground. Rodríguez also dealt with North. George knew all about Fernandez's dealings with the White House and apparently went to great lengths to protect them.[^36]

After a federal judge ruled that the Fernandez defense could use top secret CIA records, the Justice Department, at the urging of the White House, and, especially, the CIA, invoked, for the first time, the decade-old Classified Infor-mation Procedures Act (CIPA).[^37] Under CIPA, the U.S. At-torney General—then Richard Thornburgh—is the final ar-biter of what classified information can be disclosed at trial. After the Reagan appointee blocked release of the secret material, the court dismissed all charges against Fernandez, ruling that he could not fairly defend himself without it.[^38]

Privately, CIA sources and aides to Walsh said the White House blockade had nothing to do with the Agency's claim that the information could cause "serious damage to the national security."[^39] Rather, the administration feared embar-rassing new disclosures that, if backtracked, would lead through Gregg and Rodríguez to Bush, revealing the Vice President's and the CIA's il-legally organized effort to keep the Contras in arms.[^40] "It was Bush that was being protect-ed," said ex-CIA officer, "not na-tional security."[^41]

Oliver North's indictment provoked another attempt to block information poten-tially damaging to Bush. As his dron-ing trial neared its end in April 1989, the young Ma-rine's attorneys presented surprise documents. They indicated that Bush's participation in Iran-Contra had constituted an im-peachable offense—the violation of the Boland Amendment prohibiting indirect aid to the Contras. More than just a smoking gun, these once "top secret" documents seemed to offer conclusive proof of a crime—the first in the whole sordid scandal which appeared to catch Bush red-handed. The documents showed that the VP participated in an illegal White House-sanctioned extortion scheme: In exchange for becoming a staging ground for the Contra war, Honduras got U.S. military aid and more than $4 million in CIA assistance.

And the Oval Office crisis management group—led by Bush—had hatched the deal. It was the VP's responsibility to brief Reagan, while North served as liaison to the rest of the intelligence community.[^42]

Top secret documents indicate that the U.S.-Honduras arrangement continued as late as the 1988 Bush-Dukakis election.[^43] In order to keep aid to the Contras quietly flowing, the cooperation of the Honduran government was essential. Honduras, however, was increasingly discontented with se-curity problems resulting from the Contras' presence, and was prepared to act if the U.S. failed to provide the promised aid. State Department analysts had warned senior officials in a secret memo in August 1988 "that Honduran Com-mander-In-Chief Regalado refused on August 26 to release military supplies for the reinfiltration into Nicaragua of 3,000 insurgents" needed "to prevent the Sandinistas from establishing con-trol in areas pre-viously dominated by the rebels.... Without the am-munition," they warned, "... [the Contras] cannot rearm more than the 1,000 insur-gents it planned to reinfiltrate during August."

A month later, senior U.S. administration officials warned in a TOP SECRET Morning Summary that "Honduras would soon have to press publicly for direct U.S.-Sandinista ne-gotiations" because it "may not be able to wait for a new U.S. administration to begin addressing" the matter. By the end of October, the situation had worsened, and State Department analysts expressed their growing apprehension in an ex-plosive October 28 Morning Summary.

"Honduras: The Ante Grows," the tenth item on the sum-mary began. "Armed forces [Commander-In-Chief Humber-to] Regalado [Hernandez] told a U.S. military official on October 25 [1988] that the United States could forget about continued Honduran support for the Nicaraguan resistance if U.S. military assistance is cut from US Dols 60 million to US Dols 39 million, as 'word' has it from Washington."[^44]

Then, in a "comment" on the matter, the analysts wrote what was to cause the White House, and particularly Bush, so much worry: "Honduras is moving towards disengage-ment from the Nicaraguan resistance...a reduction in the [U.S.] security assistance that the Hondurans see as a quid pro quo for their cooperation could has-ten the policy shift." (Emphasis added). It wasn't a complete surprise. From the outset, the Hondurans had demanded $1.377 billion through 1990 as their re-ward for secretly assisting the White House.[^45]

Clearly, both sides understood that Honduran support of the Contras hinged on a quid pro quo arrangement. The White House was unquestionably cog-nizant of the fact that if crossed, the Hondurans would curtail Contra sup-port at a particularly inopportune time—only days before the U.S. election.

Precisely what kind of crisis man-agement was employed isn't known. The more than $200 million in military and other aid authorized to Honduras for 1990, its biggest increase in overall assistance, must have helped. "Even at this late date, it appears the White House was continuing to break the law," said a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee investigator.[^46]

These and other missing documents which later surfaced during former National Security Adviser John Poindexter's trial offered powerful proof that the congressional investiga-tion ignored a fundamental constitutional violation: the diversion of U.S. tax dollars into foreign coffers to garner congressionally prohibited support of the Contras from third countries.[^47]

As in many other cases, the denials of illegal activity were eventually eroded by the revelation of lies. At first, the Honduras deal was completely denied. When the documents surfaced, the administration fell back on plan B. It admitted discussions had taken place, but denied that the scheme was ever implemented. The plan, said ac-ting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Michael Kozak, who participated in the discus-sions, was simply another one of North's foolish ideas killed by the State Department. It could "wind up compromising us," Shultz ex-panded.[^48] For the most part, Congress and the press not only accepted the denial, but also the Bush White House's assurance that no documents were deliberately concealed. One dis-gruntled House Foreign Affairs Com-mittee investigator protested: "This thing has been swept under the car-pet."[^49]

And there it lies, along with the large, ominous lump of Bush's lies and coverups. Bush's direct involvement with, and close proximity to, these documented covert operations while Reagan's vice president, provoke legitimate concerns about the growing evidence that he has been a loyal secret member of the intelligence establishment for nearly 40 years. Inevitably, more people will trip over the mess under the carpet. The significant question is: Will they point at George Bush as they fall?

## George Bush's Inside Track

**By Karen Branan**

Bush's pale image - as a traditional vice president who attended foreign funerals - served him well. Behind this bland facade, the former head of the CIA, was a hands-on VP. He actively headed a powerful, little-known institution which was key in shaping U.S. policy. While others around him were called to testify in the Iran-Contra scandal, and some were tried and indicted, Bush walked easily into the White House on a pathway of unchallenged denials. "I was not aware of and I oppose any diversion of funds, any ransom payments, or any circumvention of the will of Con-gress," he said.[^1]

"The evidence that was before the [Iran-Contra] Committee," wrote Maine Senators George Mitchell and William Cohen, "gave no indication that the Vice President was aware of the diversion of funds."[^2]

Most efforts to link Bush to the Iran-Contra affair failed because they focused on Bush as adviser to the President ("What did he tell Reagan?"). They ignored this particular vice president's unique and central posi-tion within the National Security Council and, in par-ticular, his relationship to Adm. John Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver North, and the cabal of special operations officers who carried out the activities that became known as Iran-Contra. Unlike many of the others, Bush never testified under oath, and therefore remained invulnerable to perjury and coverup charges.

Given Bush's institutional role, that omission, his own denials, and the whitewash investigations, are incredible. Bush was not only one of four statutory members of the National Security Council where for-eign policy was formulated; he chaired a little known back channel called the crisis management system.

In November 1984 Robert McFarlane, then National Security Adviser, explained the two-track system at the NSC. First there was Track 1, called SIG/IG (Senior Interagency/Interagency Group), providing for careful study and thoughtful debate. Then there was Track 2, the crisis management system, strongly resembling an intelligence unit.

Track 2 had two major elements: the Special Situa-tions Group (SSG), chaired by George Bush; and the Crisis Pre-Planning Group (CPPG), led by the Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The CPPG provided "to the SSG, recommended security, cover and media plans that will enhance the likelihood of successful execution."[^3]

"The principal difference between the crisis man-agement system and the SIG/IG system,” wrote Mc-Farlane, "...is that the former is controlled more directly by the White House for reasons of policy responsiveness. While the SIG/IG system is able to ensure that policy proposals receive thorough study and analysis before coming to the president for de-cision, the system is too slow moving to be used for crisis management.” [Emphasis added.][^4]

Their failure to look at Track 2 could explain why Congress's Iran-Contra Report found the August 6, 1985, draft Finding signed by Reagan authorizing arms sales to Iran "unusual in that it has been drafted without inter-agency participation." In his autobiog-raphy, *Looking Forward*, Bush agreed: "The NSC ad-visory apparatus was there, but it wasn't used. Instead, it was bypassed...."[^5] He failed to note that it was detoured straight into the crisis management system—which he chaired.

The official $4.6 million NSC budget was supple-mented by another $25 million from the Pentagon and intelligence agencies. Much of that went to an entity within Bush's back channel, the Crisis Management Center, staffed by a platoon of military special opera-tions officers active in Iran and Contra operations.

The crisis management channel spun off numerous sub-groups, task forces, compartments, and bureau-cratic boxes. Most Iran-Contra players, large and small, such as William Casey, Dewey Clarridge, Don-ald Gregg, Oliver North, John Poindexter, and Terrell Arnold, participated in one or more of these sub-groups. According to depositions taken by Congress, there were boxes marked Contra, hostage, and Iran, but often these boxes broke open and spilled into one another. Key, of course, is the fact that all the boxes were inside a big one marked Crisis Management, and that was Track 2, presided over by George Bush.

## Bush Administration Uses CIA To Stonewall Iraqgate Investigation

**By Jack Colhoun**

In House floor speeches, Rep. Henry Gonzalez has docu-mented how pre-Gulf War U.S. policy helped Iraq develop weapons of mass destruction. But President George Bush, taking a page from one of the darkest chapters of the Nixon presidency, has enlisted the CIA as part of his campaign to derail the Texas Democrat's Iraqgate investigation. The CIA is investigat-ing Gonzalez for revealing allegedly secret intelligence information, which it claims has harmed U.S. national se-curity interests.

Involving the CIA in domestic pol-itical affairs is one of the few remain-ing taboos in U.S. politics, and so far, Bush has gotten away scot-free with it. His predecessor, Richard Nixon, was forced to resign a few days after the infamous "smoking gun" tape re-vealed that he had instructed White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman to tell CIA Director Richard Helms to refuse to cooperate with the FBI's inves-tigation of Watergate.[^1]

While the media and the Washington pundits have duly reported the CIA's investigation of Gonzalez, they have failed to note the resemblance between the way Bush and Nixon instigated domestic involvement of the CIA to protect their administrations. Nor have the media explored the omi-nous political implications of Bush—the first former CIA director elected president—using the Agency to discredit his political foes.

The House Banking Committee, which Gonzalez chairs, began looking into pre-Gulf War U.S. policy toward Iraq in 1990. "We have determined that your statements in the Con-gressional Record on July 7, 1992, included information from a Top Secret compartmented and particularly sensitive document dated September 4, 1989, to which we gave your staff access," CIA Director Robert Gates wrote in a July 24 letter to Gonzalez. "Because of the sources and methods underlying that information, I will ask for a damage assess-ment to determine the impact of the disclosure." Adm. Wil-liam O. Studeman, acting CIA director while Gates was abroad, informed Gonzalez in a July 28 letter that the CIA's Office of Security would also assess Gonza-lez's House floor speeches of July 21 and July 27, 1992. Studeman claimed that Gonzalez revealed other Top Secret intelligence information in these speeches.

The maverick Mexican-American lawmaker from San Antonio, Texas, angrily denied the CIA's charges. "Your insinuation that I have re-vealed Top Secret, compartmented information is inflammatory and without merit," Gonzalez declared in a July 30 letter to Gates. "In fact, I have taken great pains to ensure that all information I have placed in the Congressional Record is of the broadest nature and readily available from public sources."

Gonzalez added he was "extremely disappointed that the CIA was allowing itself to be used to build a smokescreen around the president's flawed policies. The CIA should be above involving itself in the political problems of the ad-ministration."

Gonzalez also charged that since spring, the CIA has not cooperated with the House Banking Committee. Attorney General William Barr, in a May 15, 1992, letter to the Texas Democrat, announced that the administration would no long-er turn over classified documents to Gonzalez's committee without "specific assurances" that he won't make the infor-mation public.

Gonzalez, who has made public more classified U.S. doc-uments than anyone since Daniel Ellsberg leaked the "Pen-tagon Papers," believes Bush is using the CIA to taint the Iraqgate investigation. Again the parallel is clear. In 1971, Nixon's White House "plumbers," led by CIA operative E. Howard Hunt, launched a campaign to discredit former Pen-tagon analyst Ellsberg and even broke into his psychiatrist's office to search for incriminating dirt.

Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill escalated their vilification campaign against Gonzalez. House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-III.) introduced a resolution in the House on August 4 that calls on the House Ethics Committee to investigate Gonzalez's release of documents, citing the CIA probe of the 32-year House veteran. Michel charged that Gonzalez has violated the House code of conduct, but he failed to note that lawmakers who disclose classified infor-mation on the House or Senate floor are exempted from the federal law against making intelligence secrets public.

Although the attacks against Gonzalez continue, the grow-ing body of evidence he is dis-closing makes it increasingly dif-ficult for the Bush administration to dismiss the allegations. And that, Gonzalez believes, is why Bush unleashed the CIA.

### The Substance of Gonzalez's Charges

Gonzalez rejects Bush's conten-tion that U.S. policy was designed "to encourage Saddam Hussein to join the family of nations."

"The Bush administration," Gonzalez charged in a July 27 speech, "sent U.S. technology to the Iraqi military and to many Iraqi military factories, despite over-whelming evidence showing that Iraq intended to use the technology in its clandestine nuclear, chem-ical, biological, and long-range missile programs." He quoted U.S. intelligence documents which show the administration knew that the Cleveland, Ohio, Matrix Churchill Corporation and the Atlanta branch of the Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) were the cornerstones of a secret Iraqi arms technology procurement network in the U.S.

The administration's pro-Baghdad policy, spelled out in National Security Directive-26, adopted on October 2, 1989, was based on promoting U.S. trade with Iraq. The Commerce Department routinely approved applications from U.S. com-panies for the export to Iraq of "dual-use" technology, which has civilian and military applications.

"While the [Bush] policy did not permit the sale of bombs or something of that nature that would blow up," Gonzalez declared in a July 21 speech, "it clearly allowed the sale of the equipment needed to make them. The administration knew what Saddam Hussein was doing.... The head of Iraq's ambitious military industrialization efforts was Saddam's brother-in-law, ... Hussein Kamil, who directed the flow of over $2 billion in BNL commercial loans to various high-profile Iraqi weapons projects."

The progressive Texas Democrat contends that at a No-vember 8, 1989, meeting, the Bush administration used a secret CIA report in an internal battle. The issue was whether to provide Iraq with $1 billion in loan guarantees to buy U.S. farm exports issued by the Department of Agriculture's Com-modity Credit Corporation (CCC). Previously, the Export-Import Bank and other federal agencies opposed full funding for Iraq because its deteriorating economy made Baghdad a poor credit risk.

"This time the CCC program for Iraq was approved," Gonzalez said in a July 7 speech. "The CIA report shows that unless the full $1 billion CCC pro-gram was approved, the presi-dent's goal of improving relations with Saddam Hussein as spelled out in NSD-26 would be frustrat-ed." BNL-Atlanta made financial arrangements for the CCC pro-gram for Iraq.

The CIA report, Gonzalez pointed out, "indicates that BNL loans were used to fund Iraq's clandestine military procurement network...in the U.S. and Europe. The report indicates that several of the BNL-financed front com-panies in the network were secret-ly procuring technology for Iraq's missile programs and nuclear, bio-logical and chemical weapons programs."

The House Judiciary Commit-tee, after several hearings, called on Barr July 9, 1992, to appoint an independent counsel to investi-gate Iraqgate. This move had been boosted when Frank DeGeorge, inspector general for the Commerce Department, admitted at a June 23, 1992, House Judiciary Committee hearing that Commerce Department officials altered infor-mation on 66 export licenses for Iraq which were turned over to congressional investigators. The export licenses were changed from "VEHICLES DESIGNED FOR MILITARY USE" to "COMMERCIAL UTILITY CARGO TRUCKS."

But Barr took a hard line when, on August 1—for the first time since the Ethics in Government Act created the inde-pendent councel mechanism—he rejected a request for an appointment. Instead, the Justice Department, he asserted, would continue its investigation of Iraqgate. Barr called the charges outlined by the House Judiciary Committee too "vague" to justify an independent counsel.

"First the attorney general denounces and obstructs con-gressional investigations and now blocks inquiries by a spe-cial counsel," Gonzalez responded the same day. "Barr is playing a dangerous game in a desperate effort to protect the Bush administration."

## Militarizing the Drug War

**By David Isenberg**

"Certainly, I think we'll put more emphasis on the drug war. And if there are resources tied to it, why you'll see the services compete for these, and probably vigorously. We take pride in being accomplished bureaucrats, as well as military men. And I think it's legitimate for military men to try and perpetuate their institution...."[^1] -Adm. William Crowe

The U.S. is the only country in the world that assigns its military the mission of worldwide intervention. In the chang-ing dynamics of the post-Cold War era, the charge that a country or its leader is implicated in the drug trade is suffi-cient grounds for action. After determining culpability, the Department of Defense (DoD) serves as the lead agency of the federal government for the detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the U.S.

The Pentagon has been involved in drug interdiction since at least 1971. At first its ef-forts were sporadic, ad hoc, and sometimes legally suspect. In 1981, however, Congress modified the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878,[^2] to explicitly allow military sup-port for antidrug efforts. The new legislation permitted the Pentagon to provide informa-tion, equipment, facilities, training, and advisory services to domestic law enforcement agencies.

Since 1988, that mission has radically expanded. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of that year called for a substantial increase in military aid to those countries involved in U.S. anti-drug programs and exempted Colombia from a 1974 Foreign As-sistance Act ban on aid to foreign police. It authorized $15 million in FY 1989 for military equipment for Colombia.

This legislation was soon supplemented by the FY 1989 National Defense Authorization Act which assigned the Pen-tagon three statutory missions: to serve as the single lead federal agency for detecting and monitoring aerial and mari-time transit of illegal drugs into the United States; to integrate U.S. command, control, communications, and intelligence (CI) systems dedicated to the interdiction of illegal drugs into an effective network; and to provide an improved inter-diction and enforcement role for the National Guard.[^3]

Shortly after passage of these bills, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney notified the various unified commanders-in-chief that reducing the flow of drugs to the U.S. was a high priority national security mission. The U.S. Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel is-sued a secret opinion that U.S. military personnel can ap-prehend accused drug traffickers abroad—a power they do not have in the U.S. Even more ominous, according to this still undisclosed opinion, the U.S. military can act without host country consent.[^4]

These expansions in military power have legalized an unprecedented role for the Pentagon. Clearly, some political leaders have become intoxicated with their own rhetoric.

Committed to enforcement as the solution, they blame the failure of successive "wars on drugs" on the incapacity of weak domestic agencies to defeat the well-organized and well-financed enemy. According to official policy, only the military, with its huge forces and vast amounts of equipment, is capable of stopping the importation of illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin.[^5]

(Image: U.S. policy targets peasant growers, not social conditions.)

The policy, however, is based on the fallacy that the source of the U.S. drug abuse problem is the foreign nations that produce the illegal drugs. "For almost a century," Mississip-pi State University scholar Donald Mabry testified, "American antidrug policy has blamed foreigners for the American drug disease, thus preserving the myth that Amer-icans are naturally good but corrupted by evil foreigners." Leaving aside evidence that U.S. agencies such as the CIA covertly aided or abetted narcotrafficking, U.S. involvement is far from simply passive consumption. In addition to being the largest market for South American cocaine, the U.S. sells the chemicals necessary to produce it, and many of the firearms, such as M-16 assault rifles, with which the major cartels arm themselves. U.S. financial institutions also bene-fit from the large quantities of drug money which are chan-neled through them and legally invested in the economy.

Nor have any U.S. campaigns to exert pressure or even to install alternative governments seriously impacted overall drug traffic into the U.S. Historically, from Southeast Asia to Latin America, they have at best simply shifted the areas of supply or affected which particular drugs are more competi-tive on the domestic drug market.

The most overtly military antidrug adventure—the in-vasion of Panama—has had no lasting effect on drug traffick-ing in Panama or the U.S. The State Department's 1991 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report found that "large seizures during 1990 indicated that traffickers con-tinue to use Panamanian sea, land, and airspace to transship illegal narcotics—especially cocaine—destined for the U.S. and elsewhere." In 1991, the GAO reported that "drug traf-ficking may be increasing and that Panama continues to be a haven for money laundering." The mission did, however, succeed in removing Noriega, who had become increasingly uncooperative with U.S. objectives in the region.[^6]

### Why a Military Solution?

While the Reagan and Bush administrations have pursued this demonstrably bankrupt policy with fiscal and political vigor, those domestic social programs—drug education, pre-vention, and treatment programs—which have been shown to impact drug abuse go begging.

The emphasis on a military solution occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic disparity. During the 1980s, the U.S. experienced another periodic cycle of in-creased drug use and abuse. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control observed:

In the United States today there has emerged a new mar-ginal class of Americans—fellow citizens living at the fringe of the economic and social mainstream of our soci-ety. These are people who no longer share in the hope of the American dream. Increasingly, they have no stake in the civic culture and conventional values that bind us together as one nation.... One in five Americans is now part of this marginal class. The annual cost to our economy borders on $300 billion.... One in five Americans was out of a job at some point during the past year. One in ten Americans is living on food stamps. One in seven children in the United States is living on welfare.

The recent explosion in these numbers precisely parallels the increased use in illegal drugs. The conditions—or, root causes—which have so expanded the number of Amer-icans living on the edge have fueled with equal ferocity the use of illegal drugs, the proliferation of drug-related violence, and the subversion of traditional community values.[^7]

(Image: Cocaine flows into U.S. despite millions spent on interdiction.)

### Search for Enemies

Drug consumption is nothing new. For centuries people have regularly used or abused drugs—legal ones such as alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco, as well as recently illegal drugs including marijuana, cocaine and opium derivatives. As long as there is a demand, there will be a supply.

In the beginning, pragmatists within the military were reluctant to take on such an unwinnable war. Even then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger spoke out against military involvement. "Reliance on military forces to ac-complish civilian tasks is detrimental to both military readi-ness and the democratic process."[^8]

Given internal opposition within the military, civil liberty implications, the historical failure of interdiction efforts, and the false premise of supply side control, the recent shift to a military solution is questionable. At best it appears to be an act of desperation, at worst an act of irrational militarism, mindless ideological fervor, or simple stupidity.

In fact, there are sound economic and political reasons to involve the military and none of them has anything to do with protecting U.S. citizens from the scourge of drug abuse.

As the "evil empire" crumbled, the Pentagon faced its greatest fear: being without an enemy. Given increased calls to cut the military personnel and budgets and to reinvest promised peace dividends domestically, a new rationale had to be found to justify the Pentagon's existence. The search for enemies was on.

Drug trafficking became a bipartisan national security threat with Colombian drug lords re-placing Soviet commissars as Satan incarnate. The Bush administration justified the 1989 Pa-nama invasion because Noriega had been in-dicted for drug trafficking. On the day of the invasion Bush said, "I hereby direct and autho-rize the Armed Forces of the United States to apprehend General Manuel Noriega and any other persons in Panama currently under indictment in the United States for drug-related offenses."[^9]

After the invasion, drug trafficking scarcely skipped a beat, but the pulse of antidrug policy as a national security issue picked up nicely. Faced with budget cuts, the military recognized a good thing and early reluctance to enter the fray began to dissipate. Among those supporting military involvement was Gen. Colin Powell, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The detection and sig-nificant reduction of the production and trafficking of illegal drugs is a high priority national security mission of our armed forces," he said. "The President and the Secretary of Defense have directed that we deal with this threat as a danger to our security. Under the President's National Drug Strategy, we are charged to help lead the attack on the supply of illegal drugs from abroad."[^10] The U.S. Navy even lauds its Trident nuclear submarine for its value as a drug trafficking deter-rent.[^11]

Despite the availability of funding for antidrug programs, some in the Pentagon are having second thoughts on becom-ing too closely tied to a no-win situation. According to one news report, the DoD rejected a proposal by the Office of National Drug Control Policy that would have created a unified military authority to coordinate most U.S. counter-narcotics operations in Latin America.[^12]

### Counterinsurgency and Political Control

Military aversion to another quagmire must be balanced with U.S. policy objectives in the Andean region. Contrary to past policy, the U.S. now views local armies as essential to its strategy. The U.S. would prefer that Andean militaries, with U.S. financial and advisory support, launch massive internal security missions (missions which U.S. forces would be prohibited under the Posse Comitatus Act from conduct-ing in the U.S.). To this end, the administration plans to provide $675 million in military aid to Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru during FY 1990 to 1994. This figure is 75 percent of U.S. military aid provided to all of Central America during the anticommunist crusade from FY 1985 to 1989.[^13]

(Image: Political cartoon depicting various elements of the military-industrial complex and drug war.)

Underlying antidrug activities in the region is U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. Potentially controversial U.S. involvement in, or sponsorship of, what the Pentagon terms "low-intensity con-flict" can be piggybacked on, disguised as, or justified under, the more accept-able guise of a drug war. Thus, many U.S. officials have invoked the specter of an alliance between drug traffickers and guerrillas. As ex-U.S. Special For-ces commander John Waghelstein wrote, "the United States is faced with one aspect of insurgency in Latin Amer-ica that offers the greatest threat but one which may provide us with a weapon with which to regain the moral high ground we have appeared to have lost. There is an alliance between some drug traffick-ers and some insurgents.... A melding in the American public's mind and in Congress of this connection would lead to the necessary support to counter the guerrilla/narcotics terrorists in this hemisphere."[^14]

An examination of Pentagon documents confirms that the DoD views its anti-drug mission as just a form of so-called "low-intensity conflict" which can only be fought with counter-insurgency strategy and tactics. Thus, U.S. policy now targets drug traffickers as new enemies but specifically includes old enemies—guerrilla groups alleged to have links to the traf-fickers. The U.S. can continue to supply Andean militaries with weaponry and training to improve the counterinsurgen-cy campaigns which remain their top priority.

These "narcorevolutionaries" figure prominently in a classified planning document leaked in 1992 to the New York Times. It suggests seven potential conflicts that could involve U.S. forces over the next ten years. In one particularly fanci-ful scenario for Panama, right-wing elements of the national police force ally with former drug-dealing Panamanian Defense Force leaders who have connections to narcoter-rorist elements of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colom-bia. Together, they threaten to close the Panama Canal unless the Panamanian government hands over power.[^15]

### Failure of the Overt Agenda

Despite massive increases in Pentagon antidrug spending, the military has not met with success, nor, in fact, does it even know how to measure it. On February 8, 1989, the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an execute order that "level of effort" reporting is the preferred method of assessing performance. This approach quantifies counterdrug support by using such measures as the number of "flying hours" or "ship days" that DoD forces log in performing counterdrug operations. Such statistics, however, are measures of input, not results and as such are irrelevant to determining efficacy.

Other government agencies are more candid in their judg-ments. In late 1991, the GAO reported that "DoD's detection and monitoring efforts have not had a significant impact on the national goal of reducing drug supplies.... Interdiction alone cannot raise cocaine traffickers' costs and risk enough to make a difference, regardless of how well DoD carries out its interdiction and monitoring mission."[^16]

Even the Pentagon's own internal reports have been criti-cal. Last year the DoD Inspector General released a report on the efforts of the state and territorial National Guard forces, whose antidrug funding has risen about 400 percent since FY '89.[^17] It found that Guard forces "had not fully identified their counternarcotics workload; [had not] sought feedback from the LEAs on the Guard counternarcotics operations; measured the effectiveness of the support provided, [n]or conducted long-term planning, programming and budgeting for counternarcotics operations."[^18]

Another Pentagon Inspector General Report found that "JTF-5 duplicates counternarcotics capabilities" at other Pacific Command activities.[^19]

In late 1991, the Pentagon Inspector General issued a comprehensive report on DoD support to U.S. drug interdiction efforts. It found that DoD's counterdrug program has not been adequately coordinated with law enforcement agencies at all levels to achieve max-imum effectiveness, and that measures have not been in-stituted that adequately measure the effectiveness of DoD's counterdrug support contributions.[^20]

As some in the Pentagon rethink previous enthusiasm for counterdrug work, they realize that, unlike previous Cold War missions, antinarcotics programs may not prove to be sufficiently expedient justification for high budgets. It is increasingly difficult to support the fiction that anything the U.S. military has done serves to reduce drug imports. An-tidrug wars do fulfill other vital functions, from supporting counterinsurgencies to legitimating U.S. economic and political intervention, to shifting the blame for an internal socioeconomic problem to external causes. Additionally, the Pentagon has now built up its own small, tenaciously self-perpetuating narco-bureaucracy which will be hard to dismantle without public and congressional pressure. Given the cur-rent state of election year politics, that pressure is not likely to be forthcoming.

## Rev. Moon Buys College, Hires Spooks & Moonies

**By Frederick Clarkson**

The empire of Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church (UC) may have acquired a new colony. A Moon front group and the University of Bridgeport (UB) in Bridgeport, Connecticut, signed a deal which cedes majority control of the UB board to Moon's Professors World Peace Academy (PWPA) in exchange for an infusion of as much as $50 million into the financially troubled institution.

PWPA, while acknowledging Moon's Unification Church (UC) as the source of almost all its funding, professes auto-nomy. This claim is belied by a secret agreement between UB and PWPA. Once in control, PWPA plans to integrate the University's programs into the "broader Unification Move-ment." PWPA, the agreement reveals, with its world-wide links, will also help fund UB by spearheading "[r]ecruitment [which] initially will focus on students from the Soviet Union and the Far East." Before coming to the U.S., however, students may have to undergo a 30-day Moon indoctrination.[^1]

That infusion of Moon values will not be necessary for many new members of the recently announced UB board of trustees. Many are PWPA leaders and most have a long involvement with Moon academic and political fronts; at least one is an ex-spook.

*   **Jack Thomas** served 30 years in the Air Force, with the last six years as the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intel-ligence. After retiring with the rank of major general, he spent nine years as the Special Assistant to the Director of Central Intelligence and "was then a consultant on intelligence matters in the Office of the Secretary of Defense."[^2]
*   **Richard Ichord** is a former Congressperson (D-Mo.) who chaired the House Committee on Internal Security (1969-75). Currently he is a lobbyist for defense contrac-tors, and since 1987, co-chair of Moon's main political front, the American Freedom Coalition.
*   **Neil Salonen** was president of the Unification Church (U.S.) in the 1970s, and figured prominently in the Ko-reagate scandal. He was also President of the Freedom Leadership Foundation (an affiliate of the World Anti-Communist League), which carried out covert political operations on behalf of the Nixon White House and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency.[^3] Salonen is Vice-Chair of PWPA, and President of its parent group, the International Cultural Foundation, where he also over-sees Paragon House, the Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy, and the International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences.
*   **Phillip V. Sanchez** was U.S. Ambassador to Honduras under Nixon, and to Colombia under Ford and Carter. He is currently publisher of Moon's Spanish language daily in New York, *Noticias del Mundo*, as well as Vice President of the American Freedom Coalition.

Also on the board are several Moon-linked academics who lobbied heavily for the UB takeover, notably PWPA leaders Morton Kaplan of the University of Chicago, and Richard Rubinstein of Florida State University.[^4]

The high-profile, Moon-loyal composition of the board is typical of UC operations. "Moon's modus operandi," charged former Moon leader Steven Hassan," "has always been to establish a front group, get some legitimate names attached to it, then use the names to establish its own credibility."

### Democracy 101

Trying to block finalization of the deal is the Coalition of Concerned Citizens. This strong group of alumni and civic leaders charges that UB ignored other, more attractive op-tions for bailing out UB. The UB-UC association, they argue, will compromise academic and religious freedom and pose serious, ongoing problems for the city of Bridgeport.

Ultimately the courts may decide. A lawsuit is being filed against the university to stop the deal, and the Connecticut Attorney-General is also looking into the legitimacy of the takeover. Although a private university, UB has a state charter which insists that the school remain "non-sectarian." In light of Unification control and Moon's well-documented vision of himself as the Second Coming ready to lead a global theocracy—a secular future for UB under Moon's leadership would take a miracle.

## Inside the L.A. Secret Police

**By Fred Hoffman**

Mike Rothmiller and Ivan G. Goldman, *L.A. Secret Police: Inside the LAPD Elite Spy Network* (New York: Pocket Books, 1992), $5.95.

Secret police intelligence files on the "movers and shak-ers" of Southern California provided Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates with power similar to that once wielded by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Rothmiller's book reveals how the Organized Crime Intelligence Division (OCID) of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) collected extensive dos-siers on the politically powerful, Hollywood celebrities, and others suspected of "wrongdoing." Since its founding in 1957, OCID has been a cover for politically motivated inves-tigations and prurient interests.

It provided a ready tool for gath-ering useful information on any-one "who had power over money or politics or labor unions or mass media" in Southern California, writes Rothmiller. "No suspi-cions of criminal activity were necessary."

A former OCID detective, Mike Rothmiller and his col-laborator Ivan G. Goldman expose a spy network that rou-tinely used illegal surveillance to gather information on the behavior of former governors Jerry and Edmund Brown, Mayors Tom Bradley and Sam Yorty, the Kennedys, former California Attorney General John Van De Kamp, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, Pat Buchanan, Rock Hudson, Mi-chael Jackson, Liberace, Barbra Streisand, Muhammad Ali, and the members of the L.A. police commission. Owners of major league ball clubs, movie and TV producers, real estate entrepreneurs and even the father-in-law of Chief Gates' daughter, as well as her bridegroom, had secret police files.

Although a few members of organized crime syndicates were investigated, law enforcement was of secondary impor-tance to establishing political leverage. Chief Gates appar-ently took good advantage of this power. Despite irresponsible remarks on his part and extensive charges of police brutality against his department, the former OCID captain was virtually invulnerable at the level of city politics. He was armed with OCID files containing closely-held intel-ligence on sexual improprieties and corruption among some members of the City Council.

### Pattern of Brutality, Racism, and Corruption

During Rothmiller's 11-year progress from Police Aca-demy to street patrol, to vice squad, to five-year stint as a detective in the elite OCID, he became increasingly disil-lusioned. Eventually, he came to see the LAPD as a brutally racist professional subculture in which falsification of evi-dence was commonplace and "deranged bullies" were ac-cepted as fellow officers.

Tasked with spying, it is not surprising that OCID de-tectives engaged in the sort of illegal activities common to in-telligence agencies: telephone intercepts, bugging, and bur-glaries. OCID became a bastion of secret privilege whose operatives had complete control over their work and hours. Accounting procedures were loose and expense accounts were generous. There were no roll calls and investigators were provided with city cars they could drive home. Much time and energy went into putting out an intelligence bul-letin—a kind of lewd *People* magazine—for Chief Gates. Juicy gossip and raw information on the famous and the powerful were ends in themselves. In fact, OCID was ex-plicitly ordered not to make arrests lest they jeopardize the division's secrecy and interrupt the flow of information. From a law enforcement perspective, "This so-called elite LAPD division," wrote Rothmiller, "had to be the laziest, least productive unit in the whole department."

As an intelligence unit, however, it was quite busy. Politi-cal espionage was coordinated by two detectives who could assemble larger units, "quiet teams," as needed. These "quiet teams" included experts in every kind of investigation: tech-nical surveillance, undercover work, as well as lock men, interrogators, analysts expert in deductive reasoning, street fighters and rubber hose artists. OCID had numerous inform-ants and plenty of money to pay them. The filing system contained "thousands and thousands" of files in a paper maze designed to thwart court orders for discovery of police files.

Newly assigned to OCID, Rothmiller read through the files. He found a mindless mosaic of facts, suppositions, rumors, unsubstantiated gossip, and often "silly" hard data which seemed to have nothing to do with organized crime: the date Don Rickles played Caesar's Palace; details on Rock Hudson's "gay trysts." In Robert Kennedy's file, however, he learned that investigators "accounted for ten spent .22-cali-ber slugs in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel where RFK was shot dead. Sirhan Sirhan's revolver held eight bullets." "Nowhere," Rothmiller notes, "did the file draw any con-clusions about the discrepancy."

A large number of files had more blackmail potential than law enforcement value. With taxpayers' money, the OCID conducted "eavesdropping on [Jerry Brown's] car phone conversations, [and] intensive surveillance at the apartment" in an unsuccessful attempt to prove that the politician was gay. Brown's files contained "the unsubstantiated report that the bedroom walls in Jerry Brown's apartment...were painted black in the then-preferred manner of sadomasochistic freaks." Later, OCID assigned Rothmiller to find evidence that California Attorney General John Van De Kamp was gay. After coming up empty, he discovered that an-other LAPD political spy unit, the Public Disorder Intel-ligence Division (PDID), had been trying to prove Van De Kamp was having an affair with a woman.

### A History of Secret Files

When *L.A. Secret Police: Inside the LAPD Elite Spy Net-work* appeared, the recently retired Gates discounted Roth-miller as a disgruntled former employee who left the department nearly ten years ago. Gates denied that organized crime detectives had spied on public figures to embarrass or pressure them. L.A.'s new police chief, Willie Williams, however, took the accusations seriously enough to shut down the OCID and order searches of its Central Division and Los Angeles International Airport offices.

This is not the first time an abusive intelligence gathering unit has been exposed and disbanded. In 1983, the Coalition Against Police Abuse and the Southern California ACLU exposed political espionage by the Public Disorder Intel-ligence Division. PDID had targeted the World Council of Churches, the Parent-Teachers Association, and various or-ganizations which had been critical of the police department. After a lawsuit for invasion of privacy and headline stories in the *Los Angeles Times*, the PDID was disbanded.

The consent agreement from the lawsuit ordered the LAPD to cease invading the privacy of individuals and groups engaged in lawful political activities. The city of Los Angeles paid $1.8 million damages to the plaintiffs and their attorneys. Any legitimate functions PDID may have exer-cised were transferred to a newly-established Anti-Terrorist Division and the surveillance files were supposedly destroyed.

A few months after the settlement, however, the files were discovered—in the garage of a police officer whose wife was a computer consultant with the Western Goals Foundation, a private intelligence organization secretly affiliated with the John Birch Society. Throughout this period, the LAPD con-tinued its covert collection of political intelligence through the OCID unit.

### Danger to Democracy

OCID is typical of secret police agencies and is linked to other such organizations in the United States through the Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit (LEIU). Rothmiller describes the danger they present. On a personal level, these secret units corrupt those involved and tempt them to abandon their assigned role—to serve and protect the public. But the greatest danger is to de-mocracy itself. Clandestine police organizations around the world and throughout history inevitably tend toward au-tonomy and use their secrets to foresee and forestall attempts by elected leaders, the courts, and citizens to control them. Los Angeles may have been lucky that incoming police chief Williams decided to shut down and investigate OCID before he had the opportunity to savor the secret power such an agency can confer upon one who controls it.

*L.A. Secret Police* is timely. Although the writing is raw, the book has greater depth than one might expect from work on the troubles of law enforcement in Los Angeles published less than three months after the uprising. Rothmiller reflected for years on his experience with the L.A. Police Department. The videotaped beating of Rodney King and the struggle between Chief Gates and the Los Angeles Police Commission and other public officials give his story a credibility it might have lacked in the days when LAPD public relations was claiming L.A. set policing standards for the world.
