## Editorial

### Current Events

Enough time has passed since the election of an actor and a spy to the two top posts in the U.S. government to convince even the most optimistic at home and abroad that the ideologues in power believe what they say and have every intention of implementing their vision of reversing history—even if it means war. And indeed many signs point to that terrible inevitability.

A group of determined reactionaries has taken total control of the Executive branch and substantial control of the Legislative. They already had at their service a largely Nixon-appointed Supreme Court. Many experienced foreign analysts describe events in the United States in terms of a coup d'etat, a coup which most Americans don't realize has occurred. There is surely a need to sound the alarm.

Several themes of this Administration have rapidly come into focus: stark economic and political repression at home, blatant interventionism overseas, and military and corporate control of the economy.

It is impossible for us at CAIB to deal with our primary concerns in a vacuum. Covert operations and the role of the intelligence complex are inextricably intertwined with across-the-board attacks by this government against the people—attacks which are not as uncoordinated as they may at first glance appear. There is a fundamental relationship between developments in domestic and foreign policy and the scope of intelligence activism. In that respect, two complementary and dangerous steps have been taken. On the one hand there is a sharp increase in the use of covert operations abroad accompanied by efforts to legalize, for the first time, CIA domestic operations. Concurrently, powerful moves are underway to impose an unheard-of level of secrecy on all activities touching those areas.

### Upsurge in Covert Operations

It is no secret that the Administration is now committed to CIA dirty tricks on a scale not seen since the Agency's heyday. During the election campaign the CIA complained that President Carter had tied its hands. But as Michael Getler noted in the June 15 Washington Post, the CIA is "expanding its most secret clandestine, covert and paramilitary operations overseas, according to agency sources." There are obvious confirmations of this, not the least of which is the announcement October 1 of a major new building plan for Langley to double the size of CIA Headquarters. The probable use of the Department of Commerce as part of a network of commercial undercover operatives, detailed in the Naming Names column this issue, is another indication of expanded activity.

Specific examples which illustrate this trend are coming to light with unusual frequency:

*   **Shortly before his death, Anwar Sadat admitted to the world the massive role played by the U.S. in the Afghan rebellion.** He revealed, to the consternation of U.S. officials, that Egypt was the conduit for U.S. arms shipments to the rebels, suggesting a scale of paramilitary involvement even greater than had been suspected. U.S. intervention in Afghanistan even reached the "Style" section of the Washington Post in a recent note describing a propaganda film supporting the rebels. The film benefit was sponsored by a shadowy group called Youth for Understanding, which sends American students overseas in highly-controlled and isolated programs. YFU's board includes David Abshire, Director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, base for many "retired" intelligence officers. Attending the screening were CIA Director William Casey and disinformation specialist Arnaud de Borchgrave.
*   **Frantic efforts to repeal the Clark Amendment, prohibiting covert involvement in Angola, and the increased CIA presence in South Africa and the front-line states, reinforce the knowledge that clandestine activity in Southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, is rapidly expanding.** No knowledgeable observer believes the Clark Amendment was ever fully complied with, but its repeal would allow the U.S.-South African plan to boost the fortunes of Jonas Savimbi and his small band of mercenaries attempting with South Africa to overthrow the MPLA government in Angola.
*   **Africa has also become a major focus for the Defense Intelligence Agency**, according to a startling story in the August 20 *Christian Science Monitor*. The DIA openly announced its preparedness to pay up to a half million dollars to any university African studies program which would allow DIA personnel to train there. As one student observed, "what the DIA really wants is ready-made legitimacy or 'cover'."
*   **Charges by Cuba of U.S. biological warfare through the introduction of fever-bearing mosquitos**, though they were immediately countered by U.S. charges of Soviet-sponsored chemical warfare in Indochina, have focused deserved attention on greatly expanded Pentagon research and development of chemical-biological weapons. While Cuba was experiencing a serious epidemic, the U.S. charges, coming from the nation which developed and used napalm, Agent Orange, and other chemicals, were never substantiated.
*   **The recent incredible Libya-Mauritania-Mauritius controversy presented a strange spectacle of the government and the press arguing not over whether certain covert operations were planned, but over which plan had been leaked by which government agency.** None of the scenarios were beyond the realm of possibility; first, a plan to assassinate Mohammar Khadafi was reported by *Newsweek*; the government's first denial said the documents described to *Newsweek*'s reporter actually referred to a plan to destabilize Mauritania, which had failed to support Morocco's murderous war in the Sahara against Polisario; after the predictable diplomatic uproar in Mauritania, this was "corrected" to be a plan to intervene in Mauritius to prevent the progressive opposition from an expected victory in the upcoming election. These are all forms of covert operations in which the CIA has engaged in the past.
*   **Most complicated of all the sensational stories of CIA machinations is the Wilson-Terpil case.** Two former CIA operatives were supposedly engaged in a massive terrorist training program based in Libya. Yet the U.S. government, particularly the CIA, has known about—and, some press reports suggest, sanctioned—the operation for years. No one is able to say just who is working for whom, or how many present or former operatives are involved. According to some accounts, one of the fugitives actually met with CIA officials in Morocco during this period to plot the assassination of their supposed mentor, Khadafi. The exposures to date, whether or not accurate, are surely just the tip of the iceberg.
*   **The Wilson-Terpil case raised the issue whether there should not be some restrictions placed on the employment of former intelligence officials by foreign governments.** Ironically, the first person to fear the sting of such proposed legislation was Vernon Walters, former Deputy Director of the CIA. Now making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from foreign corporations and governments—especially Guatemala and Morocco—he is simultaneously functioning as a "roving" Ambassador-at-Large for Alexander Haig.

There are also developments not directly in the intelligence arena which bear close watching. Perhaps the most ominous is the degree to which the Department of Defense is attempting to gain control over areas where the military traditionally had been excluded. The crushing of the Air Traffic Controllers strike led to the installation of thousands of relatively inexperienced military personnel in civilian airports around the country. Another less known example now before Congress is a complicated and technical revision to the Federal Communications Act of 1934 which would give supervisory control of the U.S. telephone system to the Pentagon, even without any declared national emergency.

Finally, it should be noted that the overall justification for these sorts of initiatives is found in the Administration's open declaration of a new Cold War—possibly the prelude to a hot war. The campaign began with the much-maligned, and much-amended, CIA report on Soviet influence in worldwide terrorism. When the first draft did not support the allegation that terrorist incidents were dramatically rising in number, or directed by the Soviet Union, CIA Director Casey ordered a further rewrite of the draft. Ultimately the definition of terrorist "incident" was amended from past usage to include "threats" and "hoaxes." Thus the statistics were instantly doubled. The next phase of the campaign was the release of the Department of Defense report on the Soviet military posture—creating the impression that the Soviet Union has moved ahead of the U.S. in practically every index of military preparedness and hardware. This report, of course, was issued at a time when the Administration was fighting in Congress for its military budget—one of the very few areas in which expenditures are to go up rather than down.

Cold War tactics and Cold War rhetoric can be setting the stage for a hot war, as the constant references by government officials to "limited nuclear war" and to "first strike capability" suggest. The ideology of the Administration points to this, as does the apparent failure of its domestic policies. The economy is not, in fact, recovering, and the Administration may well believe that there is nothing so good for the economy as a war.

### The Return to Super-Secrecy

There are so many moves afoot to shroud this Administration's actions in secrecy that we can only briefly list them in this space.

*   The CIA has abolished its Office of Public Affairs and appointed an assistant to the Director to deal with the press by what he calls "inverse public relations."
*   The CIA is sharply curtailing its publication of unclassified reports and analyses.
*   **In may, the CIA announced that it as eliminating the practice of briefing reporters going abroad, but took a more self-serving approach to the issue in August.** They announced, according to an Associated Press report of August 3, that the "CIA is willing to provide 'background' information to newsmen about to embark on trips abroad, provided that when they return, they brief the agency on the countries they visited." It is astonishing that this open admission of the use of journalists as intelligence agents did not generate any widespread controversy in the press.

However, these housekeeping arrangements are minor compared to the developments in the legislative and regulatory fields.

*   Most significant is the imminent passage of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, discussed in greater detail below.
*   Coupled with the finalization of that law is the news that the third draft of the Reagan Administration's proposed Executive Order on domestic spying is nearing implementation. That Order does not require Congressional approval, only the President's signature. It would eliminate the minimal 1978 Carter guidelines and authorize widespread covert operations by the CIA within the United States. It would legitimize infiltration and manipulation of lawful political organizations and other activities supposedly prohibited by the CIA's own charter—though it has repeatedly been violated in the past, most notoriously in the form of Operations CHAOS and MK-ULTRA. The new proposal goes even further in unleashing both the CIA and the FBI than the first draft, discussed in CAIB Number 12.
*   **The government is taking further steps to stifle criticism and whistleblowing by disillusioned present and former intelligence personnel.** The Intelligence Identities Protection Act is one; the revocation of the so-called "Snepp guidelines" is another. When the Carter Administration won its case against Frank Snepp over the unauthorized publication of his book, *Decent Interval*, the Supreme Court decision was much broader than expected. In the wake of protest, the Justice Department conceded that the powers recognized by the Court were too encompassing, and issued guidelines limiting the extent to which prior censorship would be imposed. The Reagan Justice Department is now abandoning those guidelines.
*   A strong move is also under way to repeal the Freedom of Information Act, or if that is not possible to exempt completely the FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, and other intelligence agencies from its coverage.
*   The government is pushing for the power to conduct warrantless searches of newsrooms when officials suspect national security offenses.
*   Then there is the strange case of the "black-bag" warrants. In 1978, Congress created the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which was to issue warrants authorizing surreptitious entries for the purpose of installing, repairing, and removing electronic surveillance devices in foreign intelligence cases. In 1980, the Carter Administration began submitting warrant requests to this court for black-bag jobs—entries made for the purpose of searching for, and photographing or seizing documents and other items. The court granted three such warrants last year, but was the subject of criticism from both the left and the right. Liberals argued that such entries required probable cause that a crime was about to be committed, which the court did not insist upon, while conservatives argued that such entries could be conducted by the Executive without any court approval. The conservatives have now won. The Reagan Administration announced that it was not going to bother to submit such applications to the court, and asked for a ruling that the court did not have the power to issue warrants in such cases. On June 23, the court agreed.
*   But the most vicious assaults on the First Amendment are found in the Philip Agee passport decision and the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.

The Supreme Court ruling in the passport case gave the Secretary of State the authority to revoke the passport of any American who travels abroad and speaks out against U.S. foreign policy. But it goes beyond that. The Court stated:

"Agee's disclosures, among other things, have the declared purpose of obstructing intelligence operations and the recruiting of intelligence personnel. They are clearly not protected by the Constitution."

This effectively criminalized certain categories of speech, not even based on the content of the speech but on the intent of the speaker. "Speech," which must be free under the Constitution, was thus transformed into "conduct," which may be regulated. Congress considered this an open invitation to do likewise, which it is in the process of doing.

### The Intelligence Identities Protection Act

Sadly, but not unexpectedly, it now appears that the Act will become law in one form or another—probably the worst. The campaign against the Act collapsed in part because of what we believe were indefensible actions, a compromising of the First Amendment by representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union. Many progressive people who opposed the bill as a violation of Freedom of Speech believed that the appropriate strategy was to delay. Gaining time was necessary to educate legislators, the public, and especially the press to the dangerous ramifications of the bill. We and our supporters had sought the opportunity to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.

It appears that the ACLU representatives—though they had publicly stated that all versions of the bill were unconstitutional—determined that since some sort of bill was going to pass, the correct strategy was to negotiate over the specific language in an attempt to end up with a "less unconstitutional" version. In furtherance of this strategy ACLU representatives met secretly with the CIA at Langley and agreed that in exchange for CIA acceptance of the narrower language which they preferred, they would urge the Judiciary Committee not to conduct hearings and also urge people not to delay any further a final vote on the bill. This in fact is what happened, except that the ACLU was double-crossed by the CIA—something they should have expected. When their "less unconstitutional" version was introduced on the floor of the House, Rep. John Ashbrook, one of the most reactionary congressmen in the country, introduced an amendment to reinstate the original, more unconstitutional language. It was also discovered that the CIA had actively lobbied Members of Congress and had sent a lengthy memorandum to them in support of the Ashbrook amendment. Ashbrook pointed out that the CIA and the President preferred his language over what he described as the ACLU version. The Ashbrook amendment was passed by a comfortable majority, and the amended bill passed overwhelmingly.

This is not the first time ACLU actions have resulted in compromising the rights of progressives, and it is not the first time their strategy has backfired. As Victor Navasky points out in his book, *Naming Names*, the ACLU's "ambivalence" towards leftists has a long history. In 1938, the ACLU had promoted its absolutist position in a pamphlet entitled "Why We Defend Free Speech for Nazis, Fascists and Communists," and in 1939, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, an open member of the Communist Party, was elected to the board of directors of the ACLU. But in 1940, she was kicked off the board for being a communist. In the 1950s one ACLU director gave the FBI the names of ACLU members who had suggested the organization should join the campaign against the notorious witch-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee. Years later the informer justified his actions by pointing out that HUAC then refrained from issuing a potentially damaging report on the ACLU.

Whether in the current case it was self-interest and a desire to appear "respectable," or a sincere belief that it is not a violation of one's principles to promote the passage of an unconstitutional law which motivated this disastrous strategy, we all must cope with the results. Although the bill is clearly unconstitutional, condemned by more than a hundred professors of constitutional law and a growing number of editorial writers, the court battles will take a long time and, given the nature of the present Supreme Court, a victory there is at best uncertain.

The bill makes it a crime to divulge "information which identifies any present or former undercover intelligence officer, employee, agent, informant, or source of operational assistance." It is not restricted to "naming names"; it is not restricted to the CIA; it does not even allow the exposure of crimes; and, most important, it is not limited to information which comes from secret or classified sources. The negotiations between the ACLU and the CIA were over whether the standard of guilt would be "divulging the information with the intent to impair or impede the intelligence activities of the United States" (the "less unconstitutional" version), or "divulging the information 'with reason to believe' that it would impair or impede, etc." (the "more unconstitutional" version). In our opinion, the distinction is insignificant. The intelligence agencies have made it abundantly clear that in their judgment any disclosures of anything related to their activities which they wish kept secret impairs or impedes them to some degree. Few investigative journalists would find it easy to convince a judge or jury that although the revelation in question might have impaired or impeded intelligence activities, that was not really why they published the story.

### About This Issue

As is apparent, this is an unusual issue of CAIB. After months of painstaking effort, Daniel Tsang has produced the comprehensive and detailed index of our first twelve issues presented here. We believe you will find it an invaluable aid to research work, and will understand that the extraordinary costs of its preparation necessitated this, our first double issue.

We also publish what may be, for the reasons made clear above, our last Naming Names column for some time. It also represents a laborious effort to complete all our research in progress at the time it became obvious that the Identities bill would soon become law.

### Our Future Plans

We want you—especially our present and future subscribers—to know that we have no intention to cease publication. On the contrary, we believe that the rest of our magazine, beyond the Naming Names column, represents the most valuable contribution we can make to the struggle against U.S. interventionism. We hope that the new law will soon be consigned to the garbage heap of history, but regardless of the duration or the success of that struggle, CAIВ will not disappear.

## THE INTELLIGENCE IDENTITIES PROTECTION ACT

*   **The bill covers unclassified material.** People believe this bill deals only with releasing information which is obtained from classified material. There is nothing in the bill which limits its scope in this way. In fact, it is specifically designed to suppress revelations derived purely from unclassified material. It prohibits the disclosure of "any information that identifies an individual as a covert agent." This applies even if the information comes from a book on a library shelf, or from a newspaper published anywhere, or from a chance remark overheard in the hallway.

*   **The bill covers the FBI, military intelligence, and other agencies, as well as the CIA.** Many people think the bill applies only to the disclosure of undercover CIA officers. This is not true. Most significantly, it also applies to the "foreign counterintelligence and counterterrorism components" of the FBI, as well as to the intelligence divisions of the military services, and all the other intelligence agencies, such as the NSA. This bill would prevent an organization from exposing and expelling an FBI informer discovered in its midst, even if discovered through entirely legal and open means.

*   **The bill is not limited to the exposure of government employees.** The bill does not merely cover CIA case officers or FBI undercover agents. It covers present and former government employees, agents, informants, and what are called "sources of operational assistance." Under the bill, for example, the famous Washington Post story which disclosed that the CIA had been making annual payments to King Hussein of Jordan would be criminal. Many articles about the CIA connections of the Watergate conspirators would have been unlawful.

*   **The bill is not even limited to "names."** Supporters of the bill suggest that since it deals with "names of agents" it should not affect mainstream journalists, because one can expose an illegal or immoral operation without having to names the names of the individuals involved. This is also untrue. The bill speaks of "information that identifies" an undercover operative or source. As any journalist knows, it is almost impossible to present information which exposes some operation without giving away some information from which one could deduce the identities of the people involved. For example, last summer a number of news stories pointed out that a supposed anti-government radio station "in Iran" was in fact a CIA radio station being operated in Cairo. No names were given, but anyone who was watching the broadcasting facilities in Cairo would have learned from this story that the people entering and leaving the building were CIA people.

*   **The bill virtually eliminates "whistleblowing" in the intelligence field.** The experience of the last several years certainly teaches that if there is any area of government susceptible to horrendous abuses it is the field of intelligence. This bill will have the effect of eliminating the possibility of "whistleblowing" by anyone in the intelligence field, because, as pointed out above, exposures of abuses, even grossly illegal activities, would invariably involve "information that identifies" some undercover people.

*   **The alleged protections and limitations in the bill are meaningless.** Much talk has been made of the idea that the bill is really designed only to "get" publications like the *Covert Action Information Bulletin*. Mainstream, or "legitimate" journalists would not be affected. But the language does not bear that out, and, obviously, prosecutors will prosecute whom they wish when they wish. The House bill applies to "whoever, in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents with the intent to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States...." The Senate version applies to "whoever, in the course of a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents and with reason to believe that such activities would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States...." Neither of these clauses affords any real protection. The CIA and other intelligence agencies have stated many times that the disclosure of any of its personnel or operations impedes its effectiveness. Anyone writing an intelligence-related story would be aware of that. (When the Post was considering the King Hussein story, the White House actually interceded, trying to get the editor to spike the story, stressing that its publication would impair U.S. intelligence in the Middle East. Under this bill, that would surely have set the stage for criminal prosecution.) What might constitute a "course of an effort to identify" or a "pattern of activities intended to identify" is unclear, but it would not take much. Researching a series of articles, or perhaps even a single article, would probably suffice. Trying to root out the informers in one's group would surley be enough. The notion that this bill has any safeguards whatsoever is another myth.

## Naming Names

Because of the imminent passage of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, this will be our last "Naming Names" column until such time as the constitutionality of the Act has been decided by the courts. Although we continue to believe that the Act's application to the research which generates this column is unconstitutional—since our sources are not classified material—we believe it would be counter-productive to make the publication of this column under the new law the sole basis for a legal challenge. Much other research work is affected, and many other publications are involved. Moreover, we intend to continue to publish the Bulletin, the balance of which remains, we believe, extremely valuable, and to continue our struggle against covert operations and U.S. secret intervention around the world.

In this issue we publish the locations of sixty-nine CIA officers in forty-five countries around the world. They include twenty-three Chiefs of Station or Base and nine Deputy Chiefs of Station. Biographical material which may already be found in *Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe*, *Dirty Work 2: The CIA in Africa*, or previous issues of the Bulletin, is referenced, but not generally repeated.

### Bangladesh

**Stephen Elroy Montgomery**, who was Chief of Base in Jerusalem from October 1977 (see biography in CAIB Number 9), was transferred in August 1980 to the Dacca, Bangladesh Embassy. According to the March 1981 Dacca Diplomatic List he is serving under the cover of Second Secretary (Political). Given his seniority and his three years as Chief of Base in the sensitive Jerusalem post, he may be the Chief of Station in Dacca.

### Bolivia

CAIB has learned that the new Deputy Chief of Station at the La Paz, Bolivia Embassy is **James Lee Adkins**. As noted in CAIB Number 9, Adkins has served in the Dominican Republic, Chile, and Guyana, where he was transferred in January 1979, and where he was posted during the bizarre Jonestown incident. At least as of September 1981 he was in La Paz, where he is assisting the Chief of Station, paramilitary expert William Adger Moffett III (see CAIB Number 12).

### Belgium

The new CIA Chief of Station at the Brussels, Belgium Embassy is veteran **Robert D. Aitken**, who was born in 1928 in New Jersey. Aitken, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, left his post as Chief of Station in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania in late 1976, returning to Langley. There are no entries in State Department publications relating to him between 1977 and 1980. On the May 1981 Brussels Diplomatic List, Aitken is listed as Attache. Given his seniority and experience he is undoubtedly the new Chief of Station in the city which houses NATO headquarters, replacing James Lawrence Corrigan, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, *Dirty Work 2*, and CAIB Number 8. According to the same Diplomatic List, case officer **Juha Oliva Merikoski** has been transferred to the Brussels station, where his cover title is Second Secretary. Merikoski's biography appears in *Dirty Work*.

### Brazil

A veteran case officer who has been at the Brasilia, Brazil Embassy since June 1980 is **Robert L. Spinelli, Jr.** whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*. He was last noted serving at the Buenos Aires, Argentina Embassy, in early 1978. No State Department records have been found indicating his posting between that time and mid-1980, when, according to the July 31, 1980 Brasilia Diplomatic List, he was posted to Brazil.

### Burundi

The new Chief of Station at the Bujumbura, Burundi Embassy is **Larry G. Jarrett**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2* and in CAIB Number 8. Jarrett had been Chief of Station in Chad only since January 1980, but at least as of August 1981 he had been transferred to Burundi. His relatively short tenure in Chad may have been due to unwelcome involvement in the civil strife of the past few years.

### Cameroon

CAIB has learned that **Linus Frederick Upson III**, a case officer whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, has been transferred, at least as of April 1981, to the Douala, Cameroon Consulate under cover as an economic-commercial officer. Upson has served under diplomatic cover in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.

### China, Peoples Republic

As of at least September 1981, a case officer serving at the Guangzhou, China Consulate General is **Ronald L. Cerra**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*. Cerra has served in both Geneva and Paris before his posting to Guangzhou (formerly Canton).

### Cyprus

A case officer whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, **Paul J. Redmond, Ir., has been transferred, at least as of September 1981, to the Nicosia, Cyprus Embassy. He has served in Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Lebanon, and Greece.

### Ecuador

The new Chief of Station in Quito, Ecuador is **John William Hennessy**, born May 29, 1926 in Puerto Rico. Hennessy has been with the CIA almost from the beginning, serving undercover as a "Department of the Army analyst" from 1951 to 1952. From 1952 to 1954 he was under deep cover as a salesman for an unspecified private manufacturing company. After three years back at George Washington University, from which he had graduated in 1951 before entering the CIA, he reassumed give-away cover, spending from 1956 to 1957 as a Department of the Army analyst. In July 1957 he began a long career under diplomatic cover, serving two years at the Santiago, Chile Embassy, followed by four years at the Sao Paulo, Brazil Consulate General, and two years at the Salvador, Bahia, Brazil Consulate. There are no entries regarding his whereabouts between late 1965 and mid-1967, when he returned briefly to Headquarters, before being posted, in September 1967, to Montevideo, Uruguay. No records have been found covering the period between late 1971 and mid-1973, when he was posted to the Bogota, Colombia Embassy, apparently as Deputy Chief of Station. Between April 1975 and April 1981 there is again a break in references to his whereabouts, but, CAIB has learned from a Latin American journalist, that at least as of May 1981 he was in Quito, in the political section of the Embassy.

From the same source CAIB has learned that serving under Hennessy is **Lance G. Hopkins**, born 1938. Hopkins served as a case officer in Montevideo, Uruguay from 1972 until at least late 1975. No further references to him were found, before he was observed in Quito.

### Egypt

There are at least four new CIA postings to the Cairo, Egypt Embassy, three of which appear in the May 1981 Cairo Diplomatic List and one of which has been noted by a CAIB source. The new Chief of Station, replacing the 60-year old Murat Natirboff, who may well have retired, is **Clark Rumrill**, born May 30, 1934 in New York. Rumrill served at the Madras, India Consulate General from 1962 to 1964. After a stint at Headquarters and Persian language training, he was posted in 1966 to Kabul, Afghanistan. There are no State Department records indicating his postings from 1969 to early 1972—suggesting in-service training or time spent under deep cover—when he was posted to the Jerusalem Consulate General. In 1974 he was transferred to Lahore, Pakistan, where he served until at least 1976. The next reference found places him back at Headquarters in October 1979, and in July 1980, according to the May 1981 Diplomatic List, he was sent to Cairo. Rumrill apparently superceded Charles T. Englehart as Natirboff's Deputy (see CAIB Number 10) during the transition period. CAIB understands that Natirboff departed Cairo some time in the last four months. Apparently Englehart has also left Cairo, or is planning to do so shortly. The new Deputy Chief of Station is **Earl Norbert Garrett III**, who arrived, according to CAIB's sources, some time prior to August 1981. Garrett's background, up till 1978, is found in *Dirty Work*. His last posting, from 1975 until at least 1977, was in Kuwait. We do not know where he served between 1978 and his arrival in Cairo.

Also serving as a case officer in Cairo is **Thomas A. Ruth II**, born September 18, 1943 in Hawaii. His record is unusual; according to the 1974 Biographic Register he was from 1962 to 1963, and in 1965, a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service. Then, from 1965 to 1973 he is listed as a "records analyst" for the Department of the Army, a well-known CIA training cover. How a mail carrier made it to the CIA is an interesting question. Perhaps Ruth was involved in the massive CIA mail opening operations of that time and caught the eye of his future employers. In 1973 he began using diplomatic cover, receiving several months' language and area training, before his posting, in March 1974, to the Beirut, Lebanon Embassy, for additional field language training. He was assigned in Beirut until 1977, and no State Department entries concerning him have been found from that time. The May 1981 Cairo Diplomatic List indicates he was posted there in May 1980, as Second Secretary.

Yet another case officer in Cairo is **Kenneth Mitchell Sapp**, who was transferred from Tripoli, Libya in October 1980 (see CAIB Number 9). Sapp, like Ruth, is under cover as a Second Secretary (Political Affairs).

### France

In CAIB Number 9 we noted major changes in the Paris, France station: Edwin Franklin Atkins taking over as Chief of Station from the ailing Eugen Burgstaller; Serge Taube moving in as Deputy Chief of Station; and James M. Potts taking over from Francis John Jeton as chief of Africa operations. We have now discovered three additional case officers at the important Paris station.

Most notable is the presence, indicated on the October 1980 Paris Diplomatic List, of **John S. Habib**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*. Habib, 51, a 24-year CIA veteran, last served as Chief of Station in Morocco, where he was posted at least as of August 1978. The Paris List shows his cover to be First Secretary (Economic Affairs). Since Potts has recently turned 60, it may be that he is planning to retire and Habib will be joining the triumvirate of senior officials.

Another case officer in Paris is **Joseph Charles Bernard**, born January 17, 1939 in Michigan, also appearing on the October 1980 Paris Diplomatic List, in the cover position of Second Secretary. He trained in the CIA under military cover from 1962 to 1967, as an "analyst" for the Department of the Army. In 1967 he assumed diplomatic cover, posted to the Singapore Embassy as a political officer. We have found no records regarding his whereabouts from 1971 to 1975. From 1976 until at least 1978 he was a Second Secretary at the Ottawa, Canada Embassy. The next reference found is his posting to France last year.

Yet another case officer in Paris, according to a CAIB source in Paris, is **Barry M. Broman**, born October 13, 1943 in Kentucky. Broman served under cover as a "projects officer" with the Department of the Army from 1971 to 1972, when he assumed diplomatic cover, taking language training at the Foreign Service Institute, before his posting, in April 1973, to the Phnom Penh, Cambodia (now Kampuchea) Embassy. In 1975 he was transferred to Bangkok, Thailand, where he served for at least two years. We have found no State Department references to him subsequent thereto, but have learned that at least as of September 1981 he was serving at the Paris Embassy.

### Greece

In CAIB Number 9, we noted the presence in Bogota, Colombia of senior case officer **Charles Stephen Smith**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*. Smith has served previously in Laos and in Spain. We have now learned that at least as of January 1981 Smith was serving at the Athens, Greece Embassy. Because of the upcoming elections, Greece is an even more critical U.S. intelligence post at this time.

### Guinea

The new CIA Chief of Station in Conakry, Guinea is **Victor P. Kohl, Jr.**, born December 21, 1935 in Delaware. Kohl, who received a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962, spent the next three years in private experience as an attorney, before commencing two years as a "legal assistant" with an unspecified government agency. In September 1967 he was posted to the Kinshasa, Congo (now Zaire) Embassy, as a political officer. He was in Kinshasa until at least the end of 1969, but there are no further State Department records regarding him that span the next decade which we have found. According to a journalist recently returned from Conakry, Kohl was there as of August 1981, where, we believe, he is Chief of Station.

### Haiti

The new Chief of Station at the Port-au-Prince, Haiti Embassy is **Robert A. DuCote**, born October 23, 1928, in Massachusetts. DuCote is a Southeast Asia specialist with many years' experience in unusual cover positions and apparently considerable involvement with military and paramilitary operations—which might explain his appearance at this time in Haiti. Not only are there internal troubles in Haiti and an extremely repressive state apparatus; Haiti is also the site of a new major U.S. military installation, being built as a base of operations against both Cuba and Nicaragua. The base, at Mole St. Nicolas on the northwest tip of Haiti, is only 50 miles from the easternmost point of Cuba. In addition, the Reagan Administration has in the past few months moved aggressively against both Haitian refugees already in the U.S. and those fleeing the Duvalier police state in boats sending U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels to intercept the Haitian "boat people" and turn them back. This gratuitous policing for the Haitian regime may be part of the unspoken price for permission to establish the new base. DuCote's government experience, according to the Biographic Register, is rather varied. He served briefly in 1950 as a clerk with the Displaced Persons Commission of the Department of State, and in 1951 attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, receiving a B.F.S. degree. From 1951 to 1955 he was serving as a "traffic-transportation specialist" for the Department of the Navy, rather unusual training cover. In 1955 he was in Saigon as a "port supply officer" at the Embassy. Then, from 1957 to 1958 he was an "administrative officer" with the Department of the Army. In 1958 he was an "end-use officer" with the International Cooperation Administration—the predecessor of AID—in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Then, from 1961 to 1963 he was an "area analyst" with the Department of the Army. He abandoned these strange and obvious—cover positions in 1963 when he was posted under normal diplomatic cover to the Tokyo, Japan Embassy, as Attache and political officer. By 1966 he was back at Headquarters, and from 1973 to 1981 we have found no references to his whereabouts, suggesting the possibility of a period under deep cover. According to the May 1981 Brussels Diplomatic List, he was at that time serving as an Attache there, apparently the CIA Deputy Chief of Station. However, from a Haitian journalist we have learned that at least as of October 1981 he was working in Port-au-Prince. This would suggest that DuCote had been in Brussels some time prior to his listing there this past May.

### Hong Kong

The new Chief of Station in Hong Kong is **John F. Gilhooly**, 55, whose full biography appears in *Dirty Work*. Gilhooly has spent almost 30 years with the CIA, beginning under cover as a "foreign affairs officer" for the Department of the Army, from 1952-1956. He began State Department cover in 1956 with postings to Rangoon, Burma; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; New Delhi, India; and Hong Kong, where from 1966 to 1970 he was Deputy Chief of Station. In the 1970s he served in Bern, Switzerland, and Brussels, Belgium, where he was at least as of early 1976. The next reference to his whereabouts we have found is the April 1, 1981 Hong Kong Commissioners, Consular Officers and Trade Commissioners List, which shows him serving as Consul at the Hong Kong Consulate General. He has evidently replaced Robert F. Grealy as Chief of (see CAIB Number 10).

### India

An Indian journalist has observed three known CIA officers now in India. The Chief of Station, observed in New Delhi as recently as August 1981, is **Bertram F. Dunn**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*. As we noted in CAIB Number 5, **Thomas Alan Twetten** had been serving as Chief of Station from August 1976 until at least late 1979. As it is extremely unlikely that Twetten spent five years in that position, and as our research has not uncovered a likely successor under diplomatic cover in the intervening period, it would appear that the person who succeeded Twetten, and has in turn been replaced by Dunn, was serving under deep cover. Although in the past it was considered unusual for the Chief of Station to be under deep cover, without the protections afforded by diplomatic status, current research indicates that the practice was not as rare as formerly believed and may be becoming somewhat more common.

Also spotted in New Delhi in August was **Allen Bruce Hemmings**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*. In CAIB Number 8 we noted that Hemmings, a case officer, was at the Calcutta Consulate General as of November 1979; our information indicates that he has not been transferred to the capital. Finally, **William Dennis Murray**, a case officer located in Saudi Arabia in CAIB Number 7, was observed in February 1981 at the Calcutta Consulate General.

### Indonesia

The March 1981 Jakarta Diplomatic and Consular List appears to contain the top CIA leadership for Indonesia. The Chief of Station, serving there since June 1980, as First Secretary, is **Warren E. Frank**, 56, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*. Frank's Deputy Chief of Station is **Harrison McAlpine, Jr.**, born February 25, 1930 in Ohio. McAlpine's entry in the Biographic Register contains the tell-tale position of "research analyst" for the Department of the Army, from 1955 to 1964. He commenced diplomatic cover in 1964, posted to the Consulate General in Singapore as a political assistant. After a period back at Headquarters, 1968-71, he was sent to Vientiane, Laos as a "public administration advisor" for AID. He was there from August 1971 until at least November 1974, a period of intense CIA activity in Southeast Asia. The next entry found relating to his whereabouts is the above-mentioned Jakarta List, which indicates he was posted there in July 1979.

Another case officer in Jakarta is **Robert H. Mills**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*. Mills served from 1967 to 1972 under the infamous AID public safety program, and was previously in Indonesia, at the Surabaya Consulate, from 1972 to 1974. According to the Jakarta List he was posted there in August 1980, under cover as a First Secretary. This transfer apparently followed a year at CIA Headquarters, the only reference we have found subsequent to his appearance at the Kiev, U.S.S.R. Consulate as of December 1976.

### Jerusalem

As noted in CAIB Number 9, Stephen Elroy Montgomery was Chief of Base in the sensitive Jerusalem post from October 1977 until at least February 1980. His replacement is **Ralph J. Katrosh**, born May 19, 1927 in Pennsylvania. Katrosh appears on the January 1981 Jerusalem Diplomatic List, evidently taking over for Montgomery sometime during the preceding eleven months.

Katrosh's biography of government service begins with the giveaway position of "analyst" for the Department of the Army from 1951 to 1957, indicating that he has been with the CIA for 30 years. In 1957 he moved to diplomatic cover, posted to the Singapore Consulate General. In 1959 and 1960 he was back at Headquarters, and in 1961, after some Burmese language training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington, he was posted to Rangoon, Burma. In 1964 he returned again to Headquarters, until his transfer to the Manila, Philippines Embassy in 1966. In 1968 he moved to Saigon, Vietnam, and in 1969 back to Headquarters. In all of the abovementioned diplomatic posts he served as political officer. After late 1972 there are no State Department references to him which we have found. The next reference is his mention in the Jerusalem List, as Attache.

### Kenya

**Joel D. Ticknor**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2* and CAIB Number 6, is now Chief of Station in Nairobi, Kenya. Ticknor, an Africa specialist, was last discovered under diplomatic cover at the Accra, Ghana Embassy, where he served from 1973-1975. As noted in CAIB Number 6, he was a "student" at the National War College in 1979. He is listed on the October 1980 Nairobi Diplomatic List as First Secretary (Political). Also on the Nairobi Diplomatic List is **Joseph A. Kiehl**, ostensibly Third Secretary (Political). A journalist in Kenya has confirmed to CAIB that Kiehl is in fact a case officer working under Ticknor.

### Republic of Korea

In CAIB Number 10 we reported that the CIA Chief of Station in the Republic of Korea since June 1978 was **Robert George Brewster**. According to the June 1981 Seoul Diplomatic List, Brewster has been replaced by **Robert D. Kennedy**, born November 9, 1929 in the Philippines. Kennedy has been with the CIA since 1956, when he spent two years in training under cover as an "administrative officer" with the Department of the Army. In 1958 he went to the Vientiane, Laos Embassy under cover as an assistant general services officer for AID. In 1960 he was transferred to Saigon, Vietnam, still with AID. He was there until June 1965, and we have uncovered no further references to him until the listing in the Seoul Diplomatic List, which gives his diplomatic cover position as Attache.

Kennedy's new Deputy Chief of Station, **Donald J. Nicol**, arrived in January 1981, replacing Bruce L. Ruben (see CAIB Number 11). Nicol, whose biography appears in CAIB Number 10, has been in the CIA since 1957, having served in Jakarta, Seoul, and Kuala Lumpur. From 1969 to the early 1970s he was apparently Deputy Chief of Station in Seoul, in ...the position he has now resumed.

### Kuwait

A case officer serving at the Kuwait Embassy, is **James Michael Flaherty**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2* and in CAIB Number 6. Flaherty, who has served in Beirut, Rabat, and Tripoli, was posted to Kuwait in April 1980, according to the January 1981 Kuwait Diplomatic and Consular List.

### Lebanon

**Charles P. McCoy**, serving as Second Secretary in the Beirut, Lebanon Embassy since July 1980, according to the 1981 Beirut Diplomatic and Consular List, is, according to CAIB's sources, a CIA case officer. From 1974 to 1978 he served under cover as a political officer and economic-commercial officer at the Kathmandu, Nepal Embassy, the only previous State Department posting we have been able to locate.

### Liberia

The CIA's central telecommunications relay base for all Africa is based in Monrovia, Liberia, a structure which has not changed since the violent coup in that country. In CAIB Number 4 we noted that the chief of this essential section was **Marvin H. Chindgren**, posted there in September 1978. CAIB has learned from sources in Monrovia that he has been replaced by **Daniel H. Garber**. Garber served as a telecommunications supervisor in Nicosia, Cyprus from 1965 to 1967, when he was transferred to the major installation in Athens, Greece. He served there as a telecommunications specialist, and then officer, until at least the end of 1969. We have been unable to ascertain his postings from that time till mid-1975, when he became telecommunications officer at the New Delhi, India Embassy, where he worked until at least 1977. The next information we have is the current report that he has been in Monrovia since at least April 1981, where, given his seniority, he must now be telecommunications chief. His deputy, replacing Richard B. George (see CAIB Number 4), is **Charles E. Myers**. Myers served as a telecommunications officer in Athens from 1969 until at least 1971. We have found no State Department records indicating his whereabouts for the next decade, and, according to our sources, he was located at the Monrovia station in April 1981, at the same time as his chief. A case officer observed at the same time stationed at the Monrovia Embassy is **Jeffrey Panitt**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*. His precise cover position is not known, but he may be the CIA Deputy Chief of Station.

### Maldives

In CAIB Number 6 and Number 9 we noted the Chief of Station at the Colombo, Sri Lanka Embassy, **Richard W. Rauh**; and in CAIB Number 10, we noted his Deputy, **Gene W. Wojciechowski**. We have now learned, from the Male Diplomatic List of January 1980 that these two high CIA officials are also accredited to Male, Republic of the Maldives, a chain of islands off the tip of the Indian subcontinent. With this accreditation it is clear that Rauh and Wojciechowski run the CIA station for the Maldives, evidently making frequent visits to that country from their base of operations in Colombo. The Maldives are strategically located in the Indian Ocean, north of the small British island of Diego Garcia, where the Pentagon, jointly with Britain, has constructed a large air base and other installations. The Maldives, Seychelles, and Mauritius, are Diego Garcia's nearest neighbors, each approximately 1000 miles away. With a progressive government in the Seychelles, and the well-publicized strong possibility of a progressive victory in the up-coming Mauritius elections, the operational importance of the Maldives to the CIA is obviously growing.

### Morocco

A CIA case officer at the Rabat, Morocco Embassy is **Joseph Pettinelli**, born August 13, 1947 in New York. Pettinelli spent his CIA training from 1970 to 1973 under cover as an "area analyst" for an unspecified government agency, and assumed State Department cover in June 1973 when he was posted to Islamabad, Pakistan as a political officer. We have been unable to trace his whereabouts between 1976 and 1978, when he was back at Headquarters, but we have learned from an American journalist that he was working at the Rabat Embassy at least as of February 1981.

### Nepal

CAIB has learned that **Naran Sansha Ivanchukov**, whose biography appears in CAIB Number 12, has been transferred from Rome and is now at the Kathmandu, Nepal Embassy. The Rome posting, in fact, appears to be an abberation, as Ivanchukov's other postings have all been in Asia: Taiwan, Vietnam, Burma, and now Nepal.

### Netherlands

According to the 1981 Hague Diplomatic List, **Richard M. Luther**, a very senior CIA officer, has been at the Hague, Netherlands Embassy since July 1979. Luther, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, is undoubtedly the Chief of Station there. He has been with the CIA since 1952, and has served previously in Germany, Greece, Poland, and the United Kingdom.

### Nigeria

The March 1981 Lagos Diplomatic and Consular List confirms the presence in Nigeria of three CIA officials. Most senior is **Milton A. Bearden**, First Secretary (Political) at the Lagos Embassy. Bearden, 41, served at the Bern, Switzerland Embassy as economic-commercial officer from 1971 through 1975, when returned to Headquarters. We have found no records relating to him from that time until the Lagos Diplomatic List.

From the same List we have learned that **Michael V. Kostiw**, a case officer whose posting to Lagos was noted in CAIB Number 13, is serving in the cover position of Secord Secretary (Political). His biography appears in *Dirty Work*.

**Richard E. Plues**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, has returned to the Kaduna, Nigeria Consulate as Chief of Base, a position he held from 1975 to 1977, before returning to Headquarters.

### Oman

A case officer serving at the Muscat, Oman Embassy under cover of Second Secretary and Vice-Consul is **Kenneth E. Haas**. Haas served in Dacca, Bangladesh from 1975 until at least 1978, and, according to the January 1980 Muscat Diplomatic and Consular List, was there at that time.

Also in Muscat is **Mati Lohuaru**, according to the same List. Lohuaru's biography appears in CAIB Number 10. He has worked previously in Beirut, Kuwait, and Cairo.

### Pakistan

As of at least August 1981 **Howard P. Hart**, a senior case officer, has been located at the Islamabad, Pakistan Embassy. Hart, born October 16, 1940, spent 1966-1967 in CIA training as an "editorial assistant" for the Department of the Army, before moving to the State Department, in 1967, as a reports officer. In 1968 he was posted to the Calcutta, India Consulate General as a political officer, and in 1970 he moved to the Embassy in New Delhi as a political-economic officer and political assistant. In 1974 he was transferred to Manama, Bahrain until at least 1976. We have found no records covering the period from 1976 to 1978, when he was back at Headquarters. As noted above, in August of this year he was in Islamabad.

### Paraguay

A very senior, and notorious, case officer, **Joel H. Beyer**, has been located at the Asuncion, Paraguay Embassy as of September 1981, where he may be Chief of Station, replacing Donald J. Venute (see CAIB Number 8), who has been there in that post since July 1978. Beyer, 47, whose biography appears in CAIB Number 9, has served in Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Uruguay. At the time Number 9 appeared (June 1980), we had assumed that Beyer was still in Guatemala, where he had been posted in mid-1977. It now appears, however, that as of early 1980 he had in fact transferred to Uruguay, from which posting he recently moved to Paraguay. Beyer was one of the CIA personnel exposed in Jamaica by Philip Agee in 1976. The notoriety of that expose evidently left him fit for service only in the most repressive regimes in Latin America, since from there he has spent his time only in Guatemala, Uruguay and Paraguay.

### Peru

From a Latin American journalist CAIB has learned the identities of the Chief of Station and Deputy Chief of Station for the CIA at the Lima, Peru Embassy. The Chief is **Morton Mowbray Palmer III**, born November 3, 1935 in Connecticut. Palmer entered the CIA in 1962, training from 1962 to 1963 under cover of "analyst" with the Department of the Army. He began diplomatic cover in August 1963, posted to the Quito, Ecuador Embassy as Assistant Attache and economic officer. In 1966 he returned to Headquarters, and in 1967 was assigned to Montevideo, Uruguay as a political officer. He was there until at least April 1970. The next records found indicating his whereabouts show a posting to Buenos Aires, Argentina as political officer in July 1974. After just six months, he was transferred to Brasilia, Brazil, still as a political officer. He remained in Brazil until 1978, though we have been unable to locate him for the 1978-1980 period. As of November 1980 he was in Lima, where he is CIA Chief of Station.

Palmer's Deputy, though nearly three years his senior, is **David Nickerson**, born January 1, 1933 in Hawaii. Nickerson entered the CIA in 1961, spending two years training as a Department of the Air Force "analyst." In 1963 he was posted to the Reykjavik, Iceland Embassy as a political officer. In 1966 he returned to Headquarters, and in 1970 was posted to the UNESCO office in Paris, as a political officer. In 1972 he returned again to Headquarters, where he remained until mid-1975. We have found no records relating to his whereabouts from that time until we were informed that, as of September 1981 at least he was at the Lima Embassy.

### Philippines

According to the January 1981 Manila Diplomatic and Consular List, CIA veteran **Harry Seger Slifer, Jr.**, was posted to the Manila, Philippines Embassy, where he is undoubtedly the CIA Chief of Station. Slifer, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work* and in *Dirty Work 2*, has been in the CIA since 1956, during which time he has been stationed in Cambodia, Vietnam, France, Japan, Tanzania and Indonesia. He has been Chief of Station in Cambodia, Tanzania and Indonesia, and is now filling that role, since at least January 1981, at the extremely large and important station at the Manila Embassy.

In CAIB Number 8 we noted that the telecommunications chief in Liberia, **Marvin H. Chindgren**, had been replaced in that major position in September 1979. Chindgren, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, shows up on the January 1981 Manila Diplomatic List, indicating that he is now the CIA's chief of telecommunications there, supervising the CIA's communications headquarters for all of eastern Asia.

### Somalia

**David Preston Mathewson**, a CIA case officer whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, has been posted to the Mogadishu, Somalia Embassy since at least December 1980, according to our sources.

### South America

The January 1981 Pretoria Diplomatic List enables CAIB to expose the third successive Chief of Station at the Pretoria, South Africa Embassy. In CAIB Number 4, we noted that **Dorwin M. Wilson** had assumed the position in August 1975. In CAIB Number 5 we noted that Wilson had been replaced by **Gerry Francis Gossens**. We have now learned, from the Diplomatic List, that Gossens has been replaced by **John Louis Kelly, Jr.**, a 48 year-old native of California. Kelly, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, entered the CIA in 1962, spending two years in the tell-tale cover position of "research analyst" for the Department of the Air Force. He served in Addis Ababa from 1964 to 1967; in Benghazi from 1968 to 1970; in Nairobi from 1971 to 1973; and in Lusaka from 1973 until at least early 1976, the last reference to his whereabouts found in State Department records. We are unable to ascertain where he served between 1976 and 1980, but, according to the abovementioned Diplomatic List, he was posted to Pretoria in March 1980, where he has now taken over from Gossens. Leading the CIA's team in South Africa, given the Reagan Administration's Southern Africa policies, is a major responsibility for this 20-year CIA veteran.

### Spain

We have located two CIA case officers in Spain. **James J. Dolge**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, is, according to the January 1981 Madrid Diplomatic List, First Secretary at the Madrid Embassy, posted there in July 1980.

CAIB's sources in Argentina have advised us that **Timothy S. Griggs**, a CIA case officer who served in Buenos Aires from at least May 1978, was transferred sometime prior to April 1981 to the Barcelona Consulate General. Griggs had served in Ankara, Turkey prior to his arrival in Argentina.

### Sri Lanka

A case officer at the Colombo, Sri Lanka Embassy is **Warren J. Marik**, posted there in November 1980, according to the 1981 Colombo Diplomatic and Consular List. Marik served from 1974 to at least 1977 at the Ankara, Turkey Embassy; no information relating to his postings between that time and his arrival in Colombo have been found.

### Switzerland

One of the CIA's most senior officers, **David D. Whipple**, is the new Chief of Station at the U.S. Mission to the European Office of the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva, Switzerland. Whipple, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, arrived in Geneva during or shortly prior to January 1981, to take over from Rowland E. Roberts, Jr., who, as noted in CAIB Number 8, arrived there in October 1979. Roberts may already have transferred, returned to Langley, or, perhaps, retired. Whipple, 58, has been with the CIA for 31 years, serving in Vietnam, Burma, and Thailand in the 1950s, the latter under AID cover as a police advisor. From 1961 to 1963 he was in the Congo (now Zaire), and he later served in London, Helsinki, and Lisbon; in the last two assignments he was Chief of Station. According to the July 1981 Geneva Lists of Permanent Missions, he is using the diplomatic cover of Attache at this very significant post.

### Thailand

The new Chief of Station at the Bangkok, Thailand Embassy is **Francis S. Sherry III**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*. Sherry, a 29-year CIA veteran, has served in Vietnam, Belgium, Mexico, and Spain (see CAIB Number 4). Current CIA activities directed against Vietnam—for which Bangkok is the primary base of operations—suggest why an experienced officer like Sherry was needed. From a European journalist CAIB has learned that Sherry arrived in Bangkok at least as of September 1981.

From the same source we have learned that **Manfred Groth**, a case officer whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, was also posted to Bangkok at least as of September. Groth was in Laos from 1976 to 1977, when he was transferred to Bern, Switzerland. It is not known where he served between that posting and his arrival in Thailand.

### Tunisia

**Ralph C. Hughes**, a case officer whose biography appears in CAIB Number 2, was located by a CAIB source at the Tunis, Tunisia Embassy as of February 1981. He is apparently Deputy Chief of Station there, having been transferred from the Amman, Jordan assignment noted in our second issue.

### Turkey

According to the January 1981 Ankara Diplomatic List, **James A. Higham**, a veteran case officer, is now at the Ankara, Turkey Embassy, under cover as First Secretary. Higham, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work* is actually Chief of Station.

### Uganda

The Chief of Station at the Kampala, Uganda Embassy is **Carol Ann Roehl**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*. Roehl, one of the few high-ranking women CIA officers, has served in the Sudan and Tanzania. According to a CAIB source, she was in Kampala, as consular officer, at least as of September 1980.

### United Kingdom

A case officer who appears on the April 1981 London Diplomatic List is **Stephen L. Conn**, born October 21, 1932. Conn was posted to the London, United Kingdom Embassy at least as of this past April, in the cover position of First Secretary (Political). He served from 1970 to 1973 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, before returning to Headquarters, where he remained until at least 1976, after which no State Department records of his whereabouts have been found until he surfaced in London.

### Upper Volta

A case officer whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, **Donn Alden Weaver**, has been transferred from Kenya to the Ouagadougou, Upper Volta Embassy in the cover position of Second Secretary and Consul. Weaver appears on the November 1980 Ouagadougou Diplomatic List, indicating that he arrived sometime prior thereto.

### Zaire

**Montgomery L. Rogers**, a senior case officer whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*, has been recently posted to the Kinshasa, Zaire Embassy as a consular officer. Our source indicates to us that he appeared there at the beginning of October 1981. He is probably the Deputy Chief of Station.

Our source also has located the new Chief of Base at the Lubumbashi Consulate General, **John F. McCarthy III**, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work 2*. McCarthy had been Chief of Base in Kaduna, Nigeria since late 1978.

### Zambia

In June, the government of Zambia expelled two U.S. diplomats and declared four others absent from the country at that time persona non grata. All were accused of being CIA officers. Among those barred from returning was **Frederick Boyce Lundahl**, the CIA Chief of Station in Maputo, Mozambique, expelled from that country in March. A high Zambian foreign ministry official was also arrested, accused of collaborating with the CIA officers. CAIB has learned that in the wake of the expulsions roving Ambassador-at-Large and former Deputy Director of the CIA **Vernon Walters** rushed to Lusaka to attempt to mend fences with the nervous Kaunda government. It is thus at a critical time that, we have learned, there is a new CIA Chief of Station in Lusaka. **Robert H. Lupton**, an Africa specialist, has departed (see CAIB Number 4), and **William S. Lofgren**, who has, according to State Department records, never served in Africa before, arrived, at least as of August. Lofgren, whose biography appears in *Dirty Work*, has worked during his 14-year CIA career in India, Lebanon, Cyprus, and Greece. It may well be that the Agency felt the delicacy of the situation required a fresh presence, someone not known in Africa. However, Lofgren, who spent the 1970s in every strife-torn area of the eastern Mediterranean, is not unfamiliar with the unstable political situations.
