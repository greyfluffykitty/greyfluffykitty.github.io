## TRUTHLIES

**Lying for a Living: How Washington Survives and Thrives – A Six-Pack of Lies**

A lie is not just the dictionary opposite of the truth. For although what is true and what is false can be subject to interpretation and can change with context and time, lies are something else. They are deliberate efforts to deceive. Some liars lie because it is their job; some lie for personal gain, expedience, or to advance causes they believe in; some believe their own lies and no longer know the difference. We are not talking here about "Your hair looks great, girl" lies, we are talking about a poisonous breach of ethics that rots trust between people, and between people and their elected and appointed officials.

Lies and liars in the body politic are so endemic it is hardly news. It should be. A government that lies to its people will always shrink from openness and fear democracy. In that spirit *CAQ* introduces its Liars' Lair. Please send along your nominations.

### Lie: The Anti-Terrorism Bill Only Targets Terrorists

**by Kit Gage**

Calling it "a mighty blow" against terrorism, on April 24 President Clinton signed the Terrorism Prevention Act. He added that the US must "resolve to hold fast against the forces of violence and division by never allowing them to shake our resolve or break our spirit, to frighten us into sacrificing our sacred freedoms or surrendering a drop of precious American liberty."

But the act does exactly what Clinton warned against. The administration, with bipartisan congressional support, has indeed sacrificed "sacred freedoms" and "precious American liberty." The biggest losers are not "terrorists," but all who work to improve conditions in the US and abroad, along with US prisoners, legally resident foreigners, and would-be visitors and asylum-seekers. Since the act does not really affect only "terrorists," then who are its targets and why?

**Prisoners**

The new law effectively guts habeas corpus, the long-standing, constitutionally-based right of prisoners to appeal state court rulings to the federal courts. Under this law, the federal courts may no longer overrule state court interpretations of constitutional law. Even when prisoners have compelling evidence of their innocence or of having been wrongly imprisoned, they will now have to prove the state acted "unreasonably" – a new, very tough standard. Further, prisoners now have only a short time, usually one year, to request their single chance at federal review.

This provision has nothing to do with "terrorism" and everything to do with ongoing efforts to strip rights from prisoners. "Terrorism" offenses are federal crimes, and those convicted of them serve in federal prisons. The habeas "reforms" are exclusively aimed at inmates of state prisons. The prisoners who most need habeas are the poor and people of color, who are most likely to have had inadequate representation in their cases. Death row prisoners, too, take an especially hard hit: There can be no effective redress once you have been executed.

The law will, however, certainly increase the number of people in federal prisons under federal terrorism statutes and the amount of time they serve. Acts such as murder, kidnapping, or even property damage, which are uniformly illegal under already existing state laws, may now be prosecuted as federal terrorism offenses, with even harsher sentences.

**Unpopular Foreigners**

The law gives the executive branch unfettered and practically unappealable power to label groups "terrorist." In doing so, it virtually begs to be misused for narrow political purposes. Under the act's extremely broad definitions, which encompass even threats to do property damage as long as they involve conduct in the US and abroad, groups in any area of conflict around the world could fit the definition. The historical record makes the application of this provision especially chilling. Under Reagan, for example, the Salvadoran FMLN was considered terrorist, the Contras were not; Nelson Mandela's ANC was terrorist, Jonas Savimbi's UNITA was not; the PLO was terrorist, the Afghan mujahadeen were not. Yet, all have resorted to political violence. As in the past, the label will inevitably be used in a selective, politicized way that reflects policy-makers' interests rather than any objective definition of "terrorism."

Any armed revolutionary movement, any national liberation struggle, even any group active in areas of conflict, risks being labeled a "terrorist" organization. In fact, only movements that contest US control or advocate the wrong doctrine are likely to be deemed "terrorist." Movements friendly to US interests will continue to receive aid, support, and encouragement instead of jail.

**Humanitarian Aid**

Once the president has labeled an organization "terrorist," providing humanitarian assistance to groups even remotely affiliated with the "terrorists" becomes a federal crime. To make a donation, for instance, to rebuild Hezbollah schools or clinics in South Lebanon would be a criminal offense carrying a 10-year sentence – for foreigners and US citizens alike.

It also turns banks into cops. Banks must, on pain of a $50,000 fine, identify domestic organizational or individual "agents" (not defined) of "terrorist" groups and freeze their funds, with no right of appeal or provision to unfreeze them. Had this law been in effect a decade ago, CISPES or US supporters of the ANC could have had their organizations destroyed. Again, these provisions virtually beg for selective application by policy-makers and constitute a direct attack on the First Amendment rights of unpopular groups.

**Immigrants**

Some of the act's most significant targets are immigrants and visiting foreigners. Now, people can be barred or deported from the US simply because they are members of a prohibited group. They need not have engaged in any criminal activity; instead, they are subject to guilt by association. A nurse at a Hamas clinic on the West Bank, for example, could be barred as a "terrorist" although she spends her days healing, not bombing.

The law also attacks the bedrock of US criminal procedure by allowing the government to deport permanent residents on the basis of secret evidence heard in secret hearings by a special court. The rights of legal immigrants to confront their accusers has vanished, at least when "terrorism" is involved. In a particularly cruel provision, the law will turn back desperate asylum-seekers at the border. INS asylum officers may now refuse admission on the spot to people fleeing persecution simply because they failed to document their cases thoroughly or to get proper travel papers from the government they fled.

**Peaceful Dissidents**

Two years ago, 12 years of effort by activists and constitutional law scholars orchestrated by NCARL paid off with a specific bar on federal law enforcement investigations of peaceful dissent. The anti-terrorism bill explicitly undoes that success, leaving the door open to invasive government intrusion, particularly by the FBI. While not repealing the First Amendment, it sends a chilling message to all who defend the right to advocate political change.

The law also provides a billion-dollar increase in the feds' "anti-terrorism" effort. Given the act's other, repressive provisions, this money will undoubtedly be used to track down and harass peaceful dissenters, political activists, and members of unpopular foreign groups or causes. With the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies flush with cash and set loose to "get terrorists," those who exercise the right to dissent or who advocate political change are at risk.

**Consequences**

Clearly, the US government wants to cut off funding and political support to selected political movements abroad. Equally clearly, significant movements for political change almost always include both legal and illegal activities, including the use of violence. By criminalizing previously legal humanitarian activity to prevent financial support for illegal acts, the US will effectively destroy above-ground support for the entire movement. As non-violent, legal supporters of a cause are driven either underground or into passivity, the likelihood of an increase in illegal activity grows. The result could well be more bombs, not fewer.

This law will inevitably chill and disrupt political speech and will scare citizens and foreigners alike away from legitimate political activity. Whoever gives money to any cause abroad must worry that the state will come crashing down on them. Anyone who advocates political change at home or abroad must think twice. Who wants their life and associations subject to federal investigations at the whim of the government?

### Lie: The Drug War Is Color-Blind and We Can Prove It

**by Clarence Lusane**

"Raw numbers don't show anything."

– Nora Manella, US attorney for California's Central District, responding to a query about why, out of 53 federal crack prosecutions in California, not one targeted whites, Feb. 18, 1996.

If, as Manella and other government officials claim, the US war on drugs is color-blind, the color it is blind to is black. Despite prosecutors' and politicians' lofty declarations that they write and apply the drug laws without regard to race, the data show that in the real world, the "drug war" is waged largely against the black community. From carefully aimed drug statutes to the racially biased exercise of police, prosecutorial, and judicial discretion, the system targets blacks. And US Attorney Manella's views notwithstanding, raw numbers show a lot. In fact, they show black drug offenders being arrested, tried, and imprisoned in wildly disproportionate numbers. According to Department of Justice statistics reported by the Sentencing Project last year, while African Americans make up 12 percent of the US population and 13 percent of monthly drug users, they suffer 35 percent of all drug arrests, 55 percent of drug convictions, and 74 percent of prison sentences for drug offenses.

Racial bias has become so evident in California – US Attorney Manella's turf – that federal prosecutors there are facing a legal challenge over discriminatory crack cocaine prosecutions. One California study found rates for young males under supervision by the criminal justice system were five percent for whites, eleven percent for Latinos, and a staggering forty percent for young black men. The "drug war" is creating a generation of African American POWs. According to the Lindesmith Foundation, a drug policy reform group, by the end of 1994, almost seven percent of black men were behind bars compared to one percent of white males. The numbers are even more grim for young African Americans. In 1990, according to a report released then by the Sentencing Project, 23 percent of all black men between ages 20 and 29 were either in jail or prison, on probation, or on parole. A 1995 follow-up showed that the number has now grown to 32.2 percent.

While, obviously, not all black men in prison are drug offenders, the "war on drugs" is largely responsible for that growth. In a recent five-year period (1986-1991), the number of black men behind bars on drug charges jumped more than fourfold. Nor have black women escaped the onslaught. During that same five-year period, their numbers in prison increased a mind-boggling 828 percent. In fact, in recent years, African American women have become the group with the fastest growth in numbers under some form of criminal justice supervision – a 78 percent increase from 1989 to 1994. This movement into the prisons is almost entirely due to drug crackdowns.

Contrary to the media hype and the ravings of law-and-order lawmakers, most of those being targeted – men and women – are neither violent nor drug dealers. Justice Department statistics show that of the 1.3 million drug arrests in 1994, one million were for simple possession.

While blacks clearly face discriminatory attention in the War on Drugs, it is the laws aimed at crack cocaine – and their selective enforcement – that most clearly gives the lie to the "color-blind" argument. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, five grams of crack gets you five years in prison. No parole, no probation, no judge's discretion – a mandatory five years. It takes 500 grams of powder cocaine to earn the same sentence. Although repeated studies show no chemical difference between crack and powder cocaine, law-makers and drug warriors continue to resort to the "drug war" falsehood that crack is more chemically harmful and that crack users are more violent and destructive to society. The (usually) unspoken subtext is that crack is a black drug, but that, too, is false.

That most people arrested for crack offenses are African Americans is indisputable, but, as the numbers show, the arrest figures bear little relation to the racial makeup of the crack-using population. According to the 1991 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 52 percent of crack cocaine users are white, 38 percent black and 10 percent Hispanic. Yet, in spite of this fact, of the 53 federal cases for crack cocaine violations in central California from 1991 to 1993, not one defendant was white. This does not mean, however, that white Californians were not using or selling crack.

During roughly that same period, 222 whites faced crack charges in state courts. Clearly, blacks are far more likely to be prosecuted under the federal crack statutes. And it should come as no surprise that federal laws carry harsher penalties than the state laws. In recent years there have been two Million Man marches. One took place in October in Washington, D.C. The other takes place daily in the jails and prisons of this country. One march generated global coverage, endless commentary, and broad concern. The other, quiet march has at best been ignored by most politicians and pundits. At worst, they have cheered it on, disguising an attack on the African American community as a "color-blind" war on drugs. The numbers, contrary to District Attorney Manella's assertion, do tell the story, and it is a grim and racist one.

### Lie: Immigrants Drain Resources and Hurt America

**by Jeanne Butterfield**

Immigration has been a hot-button political issue since Governor Wilson in California began scapegoating immigrants to fuel his 1994 re-election bid. The echoes of his campaign and the companion "Proposition 187" vote in California made their way to Congress in 1995, with the new Republican majority pledging to "solve America's immigration crisis." The new immigration subcommittee chairs, Lamar Smith (R-Texas) in the House and Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) in the Senate, quickly introduced broad legislation aimed at immigrants, dramatically increasing sanctions for any violation of immigration laws, and proposing deep cuts in family-and employment-based immigration. Congress has finished action on these bills, which now await conference deliberations and final enactment. The arguments that have fueled the debate have been filled with distortions and outright lies.

**• LIE #1** "Supporting the current system means favoring the admission of aunts, uncles, and cousins before the admission of spouses and minor children – hardly a pro-family position." – Rep. Lamar Smith (Washington Times, Sept. 25, 1995). "It's family chain migration, with aunts, uncles, and cousins coming in; over one million a year each of the past five years." – Sen. Alan Simpson (Senate Judiciary Committee, markup, Mar. 28, 1996).

**FACT:** The US legal immigration system currently allows 465,000 family members to immigrate to the US each year. This highly regulated system includes one category for spouses, minor children and parents of US citizens (referred to in immigration law as "immediate relatives"). The system also contains five family preference categories: 1) spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents; 2) adult unmarried children of US citizens; 3) adult unmarried children of lawful permanent residents; 4) adult married children of US citizens; and 5) siblings of US citizens. There are no categories for "aunts, uncles, and cousins."

Far from a rising tide, legal immigration is ebbing. Figures just released by the Immigration and Naturalization Service show that legal immigration declined again for the fourth straight year. Just 720,461 immigrants were admitted in fiscal year 1995, 10.4 percent fewer than in 1994, when 804,416 were admitted. The 1994 total included family immigrants (464,000); employment-based immigrants and their immediate families (123,000); refugees, asylum-seekers and others, such as Amerasian children (142,000); diversity "lottery" applicants (41,000); and dependents of legalized aliens who had not yet been processed in the previous amnesty program (34,000).

As a percentage of the US population, immigration is at a historic low. Only 7.9 percent of the US population was foreign-born in 1990, compared with 16 percent in 1910. During the decade of 1905-14, the US admitted one immigrant for every 83 members of the existing population; during the 1980s, the ratio was one for every 400. Today, it is one for every 360.

**• LIE #2** "Legal immigrants are increasingly dependent on public assistance. Twenty-one percent of all immigrant households receive some form of public assistance.... [T]here has been a massive, 580 percent increase in the number of immigrants receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a form of welfare, over the past 12 years." – Rep. Lamar Smith (Letter to Colleagues, Mar. 14, 1996).

**FACT:** Among non-refugee immigrants of working age who entered the US during the 1980s, 2.0 percent report welfare income, compared to 3.7 percent of working age natives. To say that 21 percent of all immigrant households receive some form of public assistance is to obscure the fact that many "immigrant households" include US citizen children who may obtain food stamps or AFDC support themselves, even while their immigrant parents are working. Undocumented immigrants are already barred from all major public cash assistance programs: food stamps, AFDC, Medicare, Medicaid, and SSI.

Elderly immigrants who have lived in the US for 20 years are only slightly more likely to receive SSI than elderly natives (8.7 percent vs. 6.9 percent respectively). While many recently arrived elderly immigrants who have not built up a work history in the US do turn to SSI, they cannot obtain this assistance until the expiration of the three-year waiting period needed to qualify. In most cases, their working-age children have paid into the social security system for years before the elderly parent seeks SSI. And even so, legal immigrants on SSI total only 11 percent of all recipients.

**• LIE #3** "With little or no experience with democracy or our free-market system, many immigrants have great difficulty adapting.... [C]ities with high rates of immigration have significantly higher percentages of poverty, unemployment, and violent crime." – Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), (Dallas Morning News, Mar. 3, 1996).

**FACT:** Recent legal immigrants have incomes only slightly below those of native-born ($34,800 average household income, compared with $37,300). Those entering before 1980 have incomes 16 percent higher than natives. Household poverty increased for all groups between 1980 and 1990, with the rate for long-term immigrants less than one percentage point higher than that of natives.

**• LIE #4.** "The current immigration system contradicts the will of the American people. Eighty-two percent of those surveyed [in a November 1994 Times-Mirror poll] wanted the levels of legal immigration reduced. – Rep. Lamar Smith (Washington Times, Sept. 25, 1995).

**FACT:** Most Americans are unaware that our legal immigration system admits only about 700,000 people a year, and that the overwhelming majority of these immigrants are the spouses, children, and parents of US citizens. When presented with the facts, the overwhelming majority of Americans agree that legal immigration is good.

### Lie: Overpopulation is the Main Cause of Poverty, Environmental Degradation, and Instability

**by Betsy Hartmann**

The reality: The myth of overpopulation is one of the most pervasive in North American culture, spread by the media, mainstream environmentalists, population agencies, and politicians, with the assistance of both government funds and private foundations. Although its essence is conservative, liberals have embraced it with considerable zeal. This myth has a number of negative consequences:

1) It encourages demographic alarmism when in reality population growth rates are declining in virtually every region of the world. While there is a powerful demographic momentum built into our present numbers, the long-term trend is toward population stabilization. Moreover, there is ample evidence from many countries around the world that birth rates decline when people have access to health, education, gainful employment and social security systems outside of the family.

2) It is a smokescreen that obscures unequal power relations. Blaming Third World poverty on population growth ignores how the North has siphoned resources from the South since the colonial era. According to the UN, global income disparities have doubled during the last three decades, so that the richest 20 percent of the world's people now receive 150 times the income of the poorest 20 percent. In many places the current "free market" economic model is accelerating this trend. Third World elites also play an important role in perpetuating poverty. The UN estimates that developing countries spend only one-tenth of their national budgets on human development priorities such as health and education, while military budgets continue to grow. In addition, structural adjustment programs imposed by the World Bank and IMF have forced many governments to slash social spending in order to service foreign debts.

3) It masks the real causes of environmental degradation and blames the poor, who in fact have the least impact on the global environment. The industrialized nations, home to 22 percent of the world's population, consume 60 percent of the world's food, 70 percent of its energy, 75 percent of its metals, and 85 percent of its wood. They generate almost three-quarters of all carbon dioxide emissions and are responsible for most of the ozone depletion. Militaries are another big offender. The US military is the largest domestic oil consumer and generates more toxic waste than the five largest multinational chemical companies combined.

Although in some specific places, population pressure contributes to environmental degradation, it is rarely the root cause. In the absence of land reform, poor peasants in Brazil and the Philippines, for example, have been forced to relocate to forested regions. But the deforestation for which they are responsible pales in comparison to that perpetrated by large commercial ranchers, miners, and loggers who export most of the resources they extract.

4) It serves as a tool of disinformation in national security circles. As part of the "greening of security" in the post-Cold War era, population pressure on the environment is being touted as a major cause of political and ethnic violence. Timothy Wirth, undersecretary of state for global affairs, has blamed political strife in Haiti, Rwanda, and even Chiapas, Mexico, in large part on population growth.

Journalist Robert Kaplan, a darling of the Clinton administration, is resurrecting old racist images of Africans as barbarians whose burgeoning numbers threaten our national interest. The focus on population as a security threat conveniently lets the arms trade, dictatorship, superpower geopolitics, and neo-liberal economic policies off the hook.

5) It reinforces the politics of scapegoating within the US. Conservative groups such as Carrying Capacity Network and Population-Environment Balance are using the population issue as a window through which to promote their anti-immigrant agenda within the environmental movement. They claim that by contributing to US population growth, immigrants are destroying the environment and draining the economy, justifying measures such as Proposition 187 in California.

Many deep-rooted social and economic ills are also being attributed to the fertility of adolescents, poor single mothers and women of color. The result is welfare "reform" measures that punish women and children, and blatant distortion of the facts. Despite the hype, there is no "epidemic" of teen pregnancy; teen births have been declining steadily. What has changed is that more occur out of wedlock than before. And contrary to public perceptions, women on welfare have on average two children, the same as the national average.

Challenging the myth of overpopulation does not mean opposing birth control and abortion. On the contrary, some of the strongest opposition to this myth, and the harmful policies it engenders, has come from the international women's movement. This movement supports women's access to safe, voluntary birth control and abortion services as part of the right to health and self-determination – not as a tool of population control.

### Lie: Harsher Sentences Make Us Safer

**by Malcolm C. Young and Marc Mauer**

"Law and order" politicians and ideologues have long contended that the way to defeat violent crime is to lock up more people in prison for longer terms. The latest salvo in the conservative attack is a January report from the newly-formed Council on Crime in America, co-chaired by Griffin Bell and William Bennett. The Council describes itself as an organization that "seeks to provide rigorous, factual information" and portrays its report, *The State of Violent Crime in America*, by Council member John Dilulio, as a comprehensive analysis of the problem.

In fact, the report actually misrepresents the realities of crime and punishment through a highly selective and, at times, deceptive use of government data. Following are some examples taken from the report's heavily publicized "Ten Highlights":

"More than half of convicted violent felons are not even sentenced to prison." Wrong. The Council's own numbers demonstrate that more than half of violent felons go to prison. Bureau of Justice Statistics data for 1992 (the most recent year for which data are available) put the number at 60 percent, with an additional 21 percent sentenced to jail terms. In total, four out of five people convicted of violent offenses end up behind bars. Those who do not, tend to be those convicted of less serious assaults.

"One out of four criminal victimizations in America today is violent." True, but misleading. Nearly half of the 10.9 million violent crimes annually are simple assaults without injury, such as barroom brawls or schoolyard fights – not the murders, rapes, and robberies that are of more serious concern.

"The justice system imprisons barely one criminal for every 100 violent crimes." True, but again misleading, as the Council well knows. Half of all violent crimes are never even reported, fewer than half of those reported result in an arrest, and ultimately, only about two percent of violent crimes result in a conviction. As noted above, most of those convicted are imprisoned. This statistic also inadvertently points out a serious problem with the Council's approach: The criminal justice system is reactive; it comes into play after the harm has been done. Preventing violence in the first place must be an equally important objective.

"Since 1974, over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent offenders or recidivists." This statement is a serious distortion because it lumps together Charles Manson (violent) with a check forger who was once convicted of juvenile joyriding (recidivist). Overall, 38 percent of prison inmates have never been convicted of a violent offense, and more than half are nonviolent property or drug offenders. Further, in the last decade, the proportion of violent offenders in prison has been declining because of a surge in people imprisoned for drug offenses.

"The average quantity of drugs involved in federal cocaine trafficking cases is 183 pounds." A first semester statistics student would know that a few major drug smugglers importing drugs by the planeload will greatly distort the "average" quantity of drugs involved in overall drug trafficking cases. In fact, Justice Department data show that the median amount of drugs seized in cocaine trafficking arrests was less than four pounds – roughly two percent of the 183-pound figure the Council touts. A 1994 Justice Department report concluded that one-third of federal drug offenders were "low-level" offenders. The number is further skewed because federal prosecutors generally choose to prosecute the higher-level drug offenses and leave lower-level offenses for state prosecutors. People imprisoned for drug offenses at the state level are thus likely to include large numbers of low-level offenders as well.

"Most violent prisoners serve less than half their time in prison before being released." Members of the Council, all of whom have extensive criminal justice experience, know that judges impose sentences based on a calculation of how much time a person will serve. If a given state releases most inmates at half their maximum sentence, then judges will impose a ten-year sentence if they think the inmate should serve five years. There is nothing deceptive about this. In fact, the possibility of gaining early release on parole has long been recognized as the most important reward that prison wardens can hold out for good behavior.

Perhaps the most disingenuous aspect of this report, and the conservative barrage in general, is its failure to acknowledge that those making the everyday decisions about community safety are judges, prosecutors, parole officials, and other criminal justice professionals – groups which could hardly be regarded as "soft on crime" except by ax-grinding demagogues. Criminal justice policy should be based on accurate data and analysis, not misrepresentative displays of data. Unfortunately, that is just what the Council on Crime in America relies on.

Malcolm Young and Marc Mauer are respectively executive director and assistant director of the Sentencing Project in Washington, D.C.

### Lie: Women and People of Color are to Blame for Nearly Everything

**by Holly Sklar**

The American Dream – always an impossible dream for many – is dying a painful death. As the real causes go untreated, many local and national leaders are peddling the snake oil of scapegoating. Many people are swallowing it, in anger and desperation.

Scapegoating thrives on lies, big and small. Scapegoating camouflages the upward redistribution of wealth. The scapegoating stereotype of deadbeat poor people masks the growing reality of dead-end jobs and disposable workers. Scapegoating labels like "underclass" and myths like the "culture of poverty" mask undermining and impoverishing economics. "Since 1973," reports the Children's Defense Fund, "most of the fastest increases in poverty rates occurred among young white families with children, those headed by married couples, and those headed by high school graduates. For all three groups, poverty rates more than doubled in a single generation, reaching levels that most Americans commonly assume afflict only minority and single-parent families." (Emphasis in original.) The same was true for college graduates.

White men who are "falling down" the economic ladder are being encouraged to believe they are falling because women and people of color are climbing over them to the top or dragging them down from the bottom. That way, they will blame women and people of color rather than the system. They will buy the myth of "reverse discrimination."

Scapegoating thrives on misinformation and disinformation. The majority of white Americans in a 1995 national survey said that average black Americans held equal or better jobs than average whites. (Survey respondents also estimated the white share of the US population to be under 50 percent – rather than 74 percent.) In reality, discrimination has not been reversed. White males hold 95 percent of senior management positions (vice president and above). The official black and Latino unemployment rates are more than double the white rate.

The US Constitution once counted black slaves as worth three-fifths of whites. Today, black per capita income is three-fifths of whites. That's an economic measure of enduring racism. The Latino-white income ratio is even worse. Women are scapegoated as producers and reproducers of poverty. Never mind that impoverished women don't create poverty any more than slaves created slavery. Historically, "women have been viewed as the breeders of poverty, criminality and other social problems," observes Mimi Abramovitz, professor of Social Policy at the Hunter College School of Social Work. "From the 'tenement classes' of the mid-1800s and the 'dangerous classes' of the 1880s, to Social Darwinism and eugenics, to Freudian theories of motherhood, to Moynihan's 'black matriarchy' and today's 'underclass,' society blames women for the failed policies of business and the state."

Today, liberals have joined with conservatives in the crusade to restigmatize motherhood outside marriage. The awful labeling of children as "illegitimate" has again been legitimized. Besides meaning born out of wedlock, illegitimate also means illegal, contrary to rules and logic, misbegotten, not genuine, wrong – to be a bastard. The word "illegitimate" has consequences. It helps make people more disposable. Single mothers and their children, especially black women and children, have become prime scapegoats for illegitimate economics.

While more and more men are being impoverished in the current economy, it is even harder for women to work their way out of poverty. Women working full time, year round, still earn only 72 cents for every dollar earned by men. They don't pay 72 cents on the dollar for rent, food, child care, tuition, or anything else. The fact that many female-headed households are poorer because women are generally paid less than men is taken as a given in much poverty policy discussion, as if pay equity were a pipe dream not even worth mentioning.

Racist and sexist scapegoating have come together most viciously in the rollback of welfare. Scapegoaters have stoked anti-welfare anger by pretending that Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) is a major drain on public money. The gap between image and reality is vast. A poll of 1994 voters found that one out of five believed that welfare was the largest federal government expense, larger even than the military budget. AFDC spending since 1964 has amounted to less than 1.5 percent of federal outlays. In 1994, it was one percent. One percent and falling. Lies about "welfare queens" have made it easy to chop AFDC benefits repeatedly – as if once you have too little money, it doesn't matter how little you have.

In the world of stereotypes, the exceptions make the rule: The stereotypical "welfare mother" is a "baby having babies." For example, in the "Replacing Welfare with Work" chapter of *Mandate for Change*, the Democratic Leadership Council's blueprint for the Clinton presidency, the only age reference is to the "15-year-old welfare mother with a new baby." In reality, 0.1 percent of mothers receiving AFDC are 15 or younger. Less than four percent are 18 or younger. A 1994 US General Accounting Office report reviewing the 1976-92 period observes: "In 1992, never-married women receiving AFDC were less likely to be teenage mothers. They were also older and better educated than never-married women receiving AFDC in 1976."

Welfare rollbackers preach strict time limits for "moving from welfare to work." If you can't find a job – tough. Never mind that it is the policy of the government to keep millions of Americans unemployed. The Federal Reserve Board doesn't care if you have a great "work ethic" when it raises interest rates to slow down the economy. It cares about stock and bond investors who want a slow growth economy to maintain low inflation, low wages and high unemployment and underemployment to keep workers in line.

The failed American Dream can give way either to a new American fairness or a neofascist nightmare. The latter happened in Europe. It can happen here. As Sinclair Lewis warned in *It Can't Happen Here*, through the voice of newspaper editor Doremus Jessup: "The tyranny of this dictatorship isn't primarily the fault of Big Business, nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work. It's the fault of Doremus Jessup! Of all the conscientious, respectable, lazy-minded Doremus Jessups who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest." That's an eloquent commentary on the present. It is time to stop letting the lies of the demagogues wriggle in.

## JUSTICE INJUSTICE

### A Real Threat to National Security Racism in the Ranks

**by Tod Ensign**

On a December night in 1995, three white soldiers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, N.C., got into a car and drove around Fayetteville in search of black people to kill. They happened on a couple out on a stroll. Two of the GIs, Pvts. Jim Burmeister and Malcolm Wright, got out of the car and confronted Michael James and Jackie Burdern. Holding a 9mm pistol, Burmeister forced both to kneel and then fired several shots into their heads. Burmeister had told friends that although he had already been tattooed with a spider, a symbol of having killed for the cause, he wanted to officially earn the racist badge. The next morning, Burmeister was arrested as the principal shooter. When police searched his room, they turned up a virtual Nazi shrine, complete with swastika flags, white supremacist tracts, and bomb-making equipment. Co-defendant Wright, also charged with murder, appears to share Burmeister's white supremacist views, while Pvt. Randy Meadows, who had driven the car, was a gullible tag-along rather than a committed fascist.

The heartlessness of the killings and the virulent racism of the killers stirred alarm, once again, about the extent of right-wing extremism in the military. The murders also touched off a brief feeding frenzy by the national media and provoked editorials deploring racism in uniform. But after interest died down, little changed. The Pentagon continued to insist that racism within the military is confined to a few sensational incidents, committed by a small number of individuals or an insignificant number of organized neo-Nazi or skinhead cells. The reality is quite different. Rather than isolated anomalies, these occurrences are simply the sensational side of a pervasive problem of institutionalized racism.

**Reading the Handwriting on the Wall**

Even before the killings, signs that there was a serious problem at Ft. Bragg were so blatant they could have been spelled out on a billboard. In fact, some were. After the April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, the West Virginia-based National Alliance, one of the country's largest far-right groups, rented billboard space on the main road to the Army base. The message read: "Enough! Let's Start Taking Back America" and provided a toll-free number. The Alliance boasts in recruiting material that North Carolina "continues to be an excellent recruiting area."

Dr. William Pierce, head of the Alliance, is also the author of the influential novel, *The Turner Diaries*, which endorses terrorism as a way to "take back" the government from oppressive usurpers. Although Pierce disavows violence, his book includes scenes glorifying the public hanging of Jews and blacks from lampposts, as well as a pivotal event in which FBI headquarters is destroyed by a fertilizer bomb at 9:15 a.m. (There has been speculation that alleged bomber Timothy McVeigh drew inspiration for the 9:02 a.m. attack on Oklahoma City from the book, which he had distributed.) Pierce acknowledges receiving inquiries from active duty GIs, but denies involvement in the bombing. Apparently, at least one of the alleged Fayetteville killers, Jim Burmeister, had been in contact with the Alliance, although local police say he didn't join because of political differences.

**Commanders Covered Up Skinhead Problems**

After the killings, a great deal of evidence surfaced indicating that Ft. Bragg's commanders had ignored or suppressed many incidents of skinhead or neo-Nazi criminality on or near the base.

*   On numerous occasions from October 1994 to June 1995, Ft. Bragg-area skinheads attacked college students. Local police reported their suspicions that Ft. Bragg GIs were involved, but Army officials took no action.
*   Ft. Bragg officials also ignored a complaint from a Pennsylvania district attorney and the FBI reporting that they had taped a call from Burmeister to his hometown police chief, Tom Rivenburgh. In it, Burmeister, later charged with the December murders, had threatened to blow up Rivenburgh's house because the cop had given a traffic citation to the GI's friend. In the same call, Burmeister boasted that he could smuggle grenade launchers and armor-piercing bullets out of Ft. Bragg.
*   On April 1, 1995, Ed Worthington, an Army skinhead, shot another GI skinhead near the base. No Army investigation was launched until months later – after the December 7 slayings.

Other evidence of a problem was in plain sight. Although some racists are secretive about their views and their affiliations with hate groups, others wear their allegiance on their sleeves – and backs. For identification, racist skinheads wear "high and tight" haircuts, black "bomber" flight jackets, and red laces in their Doc Marten boots. Their jackets sport patches such as Confederate flags, German eagles, "SS" or "88" (neo-Nazi lingo for Heil Hitler – "H" is the eighth letter of the alphabet). Before the Fayetteville killings, military skinheads were often seen around the base and in nearby towns sporting such regalia.

Despite visible evidence of extremist sympathy and activities, it was not until the highly publicized racial murders in Fayetteville that the Criminal Investigation Division (CIS) at Ft. Bragg launched a general probe. The command announced the results on January 8, 1996: Twenty-two soldiers were identified as active right-wing extremists and would be either discharged or prevented from re-enlisting. Current Army regulations bar soldiers from "active" membership in racist groups – "active" being defined as demonstrating, recruiting, fundraising, or conducting training for such an organization. Department of Defense (DoD) officials have said that they can't prevent GIs from "passive" participation, such as receiving literature.

**Congressional Warning Ignored**

Nor, it seems, can they prevent passive response by the Army. Even before the Ft. Bragg murders drew national media attention, the Army should have been aware it had a potentially explosive problem on its hands and taken steps to deal with it. In December 1994, the House Armed Services Committee, then headed by Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Calif.), published a comprehensive report on the state of racial affairs within the US military. The committee sent investigators to 19 military bases at home and abroad where they interviewed 2,000 randomly selected GIs. They found that overt racism was "commonplace" at four of the bases and that inadequate training in racial awareness was a widespread problem.

Preceding the Ft. Bragg murders by a year, the committee noted that white supremacist and skinhead activity was ongoing at several bases, with extremist activity at one unnamed base so intense that it "poses a threat to good order." The report concluded that "the frequency of [complaints] related to the grievance system, disciplinary process, career progress [assignment and promotion], equal opportunity training, and cross-cultural understanding points to a need for the Department of Defense to improve their equal opportunity efforts." When the Republicans took control of Congress following the 1994 elections, the leadership dropped plans for any further investigation or hearings on the Dellums committee's findings.

**Putting a Spin on Institutional Racism**

After the Fayetteville murders, intense outrage both in and out of the military spurred Army Secretary Togo West to establish a Task Force on Extremist Activities. Ignoring recommendations to include non-military panelists, he named only high-ranking military officers and civilian military appointees. They sent investigators to 28 Army bases in the US and 12 overseas, where they interviewed 7,600 GIs. Another 17,000 soldiers were given a confidential 94-item questionnaire. The investigation was limited to looking for extremist activity and failed to examine in any detail the problems of institutional racism, including the explosive issues of equal opportunity and racial awareness training.

Nor, say critics, did West take the Ft. Bragg killings seriously enough to order a "stand down" during which all ordinary activities would cease for a day so that the Army could focus on its policies on extremism. (The Navy and Marines had called one-day stand downs in response to the Tailhook and other sexual harassment scandals.) Speaking five months after the Fayetteville killings, West acknowledged that "We do not at the present have any training about extremism groups, about extremism, about the army's policies for that first [training] block when a person enters the army. ... We have lots of blocks of instruction about things that are important to the Army, but nothing about extremism, no training, so we are looking to do that." The Army did, however, announce in April 1996, that it would start tackling racism by emphasizing "character development" in its training.

It is likely that the Clinton administration was pleased when West's task force found only "minimal evidence" of extremist activity and was relieved when most media highlighted this spin. The report's own data, however, belie that conclusion. For one thing, 3.5 percent of the GIs who responded via the confidential survey stated that they had been approached to join an extremist group since enlisting. Twice as many (7 percent) said that they knew another soldier whom they believed to be a member of an extremist organization, while 11.6 percent reported that they knew a soldier who held extremist views. Finally, 17.4 percent said they had some "contact" with racist or extremist material. Rather than showing "minimal" exposure, these numbers suggest that far-right outreach among GIs is not isolated to a few cases.

The Task Force report also noted that some senior Army commanders feared that Special Operations units "are targeted by the militia movement." West confirmed that there are "cells off-post of those who openly boast that they'd like to recruit among our members." Apparently they have met with considerable success. Applying these numbers to the half million-member Army, the task force's findings mean that some 17,500 GIs were solicited for recruitment, while 87,000 have had contact with white supremacist publications.

**Locals Document Patterns of Racism**

Community groups also responded to the killings. The North Carolina NAACP put together a citizens' task force to gather information about extremists and conducted ad hoc community "speak outs" for active-duty GIs at Ft. Bragg and several other large North Carolina military bases, including the Marine Corps' Camp Lejeune, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, and the Cherry Point Marine Air Station. Its report, summarizing testimony by active-duty GIs, detailed numerous overt acts of racism, such as displaying hangman nooses from the windows of pickup trucks and using racial epithets to describe minority GIs.

As did both the Dellums and West investigations, the NAACP found institutional racism. Many minority GIs, it reported, complained of an "old boys' network" within the command which resulted in blacks receiving less favorable assignments and harsher punishment when disciplinary action was taken. A Government Accounting Office (GAO) study released a month before the Fayetteville killings also corroborated the problem of routine discrimination, finding that African Americans are less likely to be promoted in the military. Although the GAO report did not conclude that racism caused this disparity, it did recommend that the Pentagon improve its monitor-ing of equal opportunity programs.

**Very Special Forces**

One of the findings by Secretary West's task force also cut against an optimistic view of race relations. The report noted a "dramatic decrease" in minority participation in the combat arms (infantry, armor, and artillery). This trend toward white-only units is even more pronounced in the elite Special Operations forces. Such racial separatism could lead to problems, the report warned, because it "foster[s] supremacist attitudes among white combat soldiers." In the all-volunteer army, these units carry a certain macho prestige and appeal to the more gung-ho enlistees. "The more you get into the killing trades," writes Canadian military historian Desmond Morton, "the more likely you are to get people from small towns and other back-of-beyond places, who don't have a great education or career prospects otherwise. They're keen on adventure. They're not here to learn a trade."

Unfortunately, the panel did not attempt to analyze why minorities seem to be moving away from combat and Special Forces assignments. One possible explanation is that blacks are more likely to enlist in the first place because of limited job opportunities in civilian life and are drawn to units that teach skills that can be transferred to civilian life. Another is that the white Special Forces members intimidate or harass minority recruits, thus limiting their numbers.

**Bragging Rights**

Whatever the reason, this trend toward lily-white Special Forces units is ominous. Ft. Bragg is considered a world center where elite special forces from armies around the world come for training in combat techniques and leadership. Apparently, not only the macho, "hell for leather" spirit of the 82nd Airborne and Special Forces, but also some of the racism may rub off on the hundreds of international special forces including troops from Germany, France, Great Britain, the Ukraine, and Australia who train at Ft. Bragg for varying periods each year. According to Kenneth Stern, the American Jewish Committee's expert on hate groups, the problem is not confined to the US and Canada. Australia's army "had recent problems with right-wing cells."

The Canadian example, however, is the most dramatic. After members of the 660-man Canadian Airborne Regiment trained at Ft Bragg, it adopted Confederate flags and perhaps other habits. According to Morton, "the regiment was spending too much time down at Ft. Bragg, picking up the ethos and gung-ho fighting spirit of the 82nd Airborne. This is Americanization," he said. "The Confederate flag is hardly what you would call an enduring Canadian symbol. I think an absolute rule should be that a Canadian soldier be allowed only a single trip to Ft. Bragg. They're taught that they're superior beings. They jump out of airplanes and they're given silver wings for it. And then they're licensed to do things criminals do."

Members of the 2-Commando unit of the Airborne Regiment took that license literally while serving in Somalia as part of the international peacekeeping force. Canadians were appalled to learn that regiment members had tortured and murdered a Somali teenager whom they suspected of theft and had photographed the crime. It was one of several illegal killings carried out by the group. There was no doubt that racism was an important ingredient in the crimes and a persistent component of military life in Somalia. Some of the troops had renamed "Operation Restore Hope," "Operation Smash Niggers." A video taken by another Canadian commando unit which depicted hazing rituals in the elite unit showed recruits simulating anal and oral sex and being forced to eat vomit and bread soaked in their urine. The unit's lone black recruit was put on a dog leash and forced to walk on all fours with the words "I love the KKK" scrawled on his back in human excrement.

In May 1993, the CBC investigative news program, *The Fifth Estate*, broke the story that several members of the unit were known neo-Nazis. Recently, an internal Canadian Army document surfaced which confirmed that some soldiers had been dispatched to Somalia despite a recommendation that their histories of mental instability or potentially inflammatory racist views disqualified them from the peacekeeping mission.

In the wake of a national furor, the Canadian unit was ordered disbanded and an inquiry begun. It continues amid charges of a government cover-up reaching to the highest levels of the Defence Ministry. Duncan McWaters, of *Esprit de Corps*, a Canadian military magazine, expects revelations that will confirm an even closer US link to the Canadian troops involved in the murders. McWaters claims that there were "two four-man [US] A-Team Special Forces personnel stationed with the Canadian tour. From the information gathered, they apparently wore Canadian uniforms in an attempt to keep their involvement secret from the locals. (It is a violation of military law and regulation for US troops to don foreign uniforms unless given a lawful order by their commanders.) On March 3, 1993, a US sergeant, Robert Deeks, Special Forces, was killed during a mine patrol. On March 4, a Somali civilian was killed allegedly in retaliation for the death." He was reportedly executed by Canadian commandos with a shot to the head as he was lying on the ground.

**Casting a Net**

These links are particularly worrisome in light of evidence that organized hate groups within the military may be trying to set up an international as well as a national right-wing network. The Special Forces Underground, which claims that most of its members are active duty Special Forces troops, publishes *The Resister* in hard copy and on the Internet. The quarterly newsletter advocates "strict constitutionalism, isolationism, individual rights, laissez-faire capitalism, limited government, and republicanism" and "features detailed critiques of current US military policies and operations." It opposes what it sees as a dangerous expansion of federal power and US participation in peacekeeping missions abroad. While the organization aggressively promotes its views through *The Resister*, by guarding its membership lists, makes it impossible to determine whether it constitutes a significant movement or is just a gathering of a few overheated zealots. Interestingly, the Army, which acknowledges the existence of the group, ruled that the Special Forces Underground was not an "extremist organization" as defined by its regulations.

In any case, a recent issue of *The Resister* attracted attention with its harsh critique of the destruction of the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, in April 1993. The article asserted that an Army Special Forces unit assigned to Joint Task Force-6 (JTF-6) at Ft. Bliss, Texas, offered direct support and pre-mission training to the BATF forces who took part in the raid and that this role violated federal law prohibiting the US military from performing domestic police functions. According to *The Resister*, JTF-6 provided four kinds of operational support through Operation Alliance: reconnaissance; training; logistics; and research, development, and acquisition. The newsletter argues that this integration of military and police forces "has been exploited by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to militarize the forces at their disposal."

**Did Green Berets Undermine the US Mission in Haiti?**

Another issue of *The Resister*, widely circulated on the Internet, claimed that right-wing Green Berets sympathetic to the Haitian coup government were able to undermine US military goals during Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti. The article begins with a scathing, racist condemnation of Aristide and the Lavalas movement. The far-right FRAPH (Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti) is described as "the equivalent of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion forming a political party." The hated "attachés" – armed civilian thugs who worked with local police or military units – are described as "nothing more than a community-watch organization."

The article's most explosive claim is that Special Forces members serving in Haiti met with and advised senior NCOs of the now defunct Haitian military, attachés, and FRAPH members: "First, we [told] the most active anti-communist Attachés and FRAPH members to take long vacations... on the other side of the island [the Dominican Republic]. Second, we informed them about plans and timetables for weapons confiscation and told them how to [hide] their functional firearms.... Third, we identified the Lavalas leadership, their friends and associates, and collected from [the Haitian army] information about Lavalas they had. Fourth, we told FRAPH members to stay out of politics and...let the communists expose their true agendas. Fifth, we waged a clandestine offensive against Lavalas [details omitted by *The Resister*'s editor] which in our operational areas [drove] the leadership back underground. Finally, we established an escape line to help [our Haitian allies] under threat of arrest to reach relative safety in the Dominican Republic."

When former Army Capt. Larry Rockwood, who served with Operation Restore Democracy, was shown this document, he commented: "It sounds a lot like the views of most of the senior officers I served with in Haiti. They made no attempt to hide their contempt for the average Haitian."

A spokesperson for Brig. Gen. Richard W. Potter, Jr., commander of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Haiti, told the *New York Times* that he considered *The Resister*'s account of military activities in Haiti "ridiculous." But in the wake of the publicity, Lt. Gen. J.T. Scott, Special Operations commander, issued a memo reiterating the rules on extremist groups and ordering a survey of Special Forces troops. Not surprisingly, none of the 1,111 respondents admitted violating Army regulations by participating in extremist groups.

Although many observers find the Special Forces Underground's self-proclaimed activities incredible, the existence and widespread dissemination of the claims are in themselves disturbing.

**Facing Right**

It is difficult to evaluate how serious the long-term threat of extremists in uniform is. Obviously, at least some GIs are being actively targeted for recruitment, but it would be easy to exaggerate the danger. As Gary Wills has written, paranoia about paranoids is itself dangerous. During a recent visit to Ft. Bragg, I observed vehicles on and off base with bumper stickers that implied or stated racist sympathies. Some featured a confederate flag along with slogans such as "The South Was Right"; another had a drawing of the US capitol flying a rebel flag with the caption "I Have a Dream." Army technical manuals, such as *Incendiaries* or *Unconventional Warfare Devices*, which provide how-to instructions on building a booby-trap bomb in your basement, are widely available in stores ringing the base. One clerk reported that sales were "excellent."

Does this mean that dozens of right-wing GIs are hard at work on new fertilizer bombs to bring down symbols of the hated federal bureaucracy or are organizing hate groups armed and trained with taxpayer dollars? It is impossible to say. What is clear is that some groups, such as the Special Forces Underground, are working hard to influence and perhaps recruit new military converts to their cause.

The US military prides itself on its racial policies and, indeed, has made progress since World War II, when all units were segregated. Its waning commitment to equal opportunity and affirmative action is disturbing not only because of its implications for the military, but because it reflects a process occurring throughout US society. A federal appeals court recently junked an affirmative action program for admission to the law school at the University of Texas. In 1995, the University of California Board of Regents voted to end affirmative action programs throughout its vast system. Similar decisions are occurring in other regions. The US Supreme Court is expected to address the issue in the near future with years of racial progress hanging in the balance.

According to former Army intelligence officer Rockwood, Army commanders not only monitor the politics of the troops, but discipline those who hold unacceptable views. For example, "during my four years as an intelligence officer in Central America, if any GI had expressed the slightest criticism of the Reagan Doctrine, they would have been stripped of their security clearance and sent home. So it's a question of what your views are, not whether the command knows what's going on. Believe me, they do." The other question is what they are going to do about it.

### White-Collar Crime: Whitewash at the Justice Department

**by David Burnham**

For many years, business organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have waged sophisticated propaganda campaigns to convince the American people that the federal government restricts business with unnecessary and heavy-handed regulations. A central purpose of this crusade, of course, is to persuade Congress to cut back on the series of broad government programs put in place to clean up the environment and improve health and safety. Ronald Reagan – at the time a middle-aged and mediocre actor on the corporate payroll of General Electric – began his amazing political career as one of the earliest and most successful promoters of business' anti-government theme. While GE, a major defense contractor, was delighted to get the massive contracts from the Air Force, it was a good deal less enthusiastic about being accused of endangering the lives of its employees and violating safety and health standards.

More recently, the anti-regulation message of the business organizations and their corporate backers has become a favorite mantra of the Republican Congress, conservative Democrats and, to some extent, the pro-business Clinton administration. The current drive, pumped up by high-priced lobbying and hyped-up public relations efforts, has been aimed mostly at three federal agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Armed with a few anecdotal horror stories, the propagandists and lobbyists try to persuade media, politicians, and the public that regulations are crippling free enterprise and costing jobs. But even if business wished to present a more comprehensive picture of how the hated government agencies work, it would be hampered by the fact that EPA, FDA, OSHA, and other agencies all have separate record-keeping systems that do not easily yield a good overview.

**The Ultimate Gatekeeper**

One critical aspect of government regulation, however, the criminal prosecution of corporate malefactors, produces a wealth of data which is subject to systematic analysis. Based on the centralized records maintained by the Department of Justice, the data show that when it comes to business – contrary to the sad stories told by Ronnie Reagan and the National Association of Manufacturers – the federal government may occasionally growl but rarely bites.

Here's how the process works: When federal agencies find that their regulations have been violated, they are authorized by law to impose administrative penalties. In this kind of situation, the penalties paid by the miscreants – say, a nuclear utility that has not fully complied with a rule of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission – are usually negligible. When there is evidence that a business or individual corporate manager has violated the criminal law, however, the agencies are almost always required to refer the matter to the Justice Department. The DoJ and its 90-plus independent United States attorneys around the country then become the ultimate gatekeepers. They have sole authority to decide if a crime has been committed; who, if anyone, will be charged; and what specific law will be cited in the indictment. That last element is important because the statute chosen by the prosecutor largely determines the sentence that the judge must impose.

Under Justice Department procedures, the US attorneys are required to submit to Washington detailed information about every matter that has been referred to them for prosecution by each of the investigating agencies – the FBI, FDA, EPA or OSHA. The records include information on: What was the leading charge of each referral? Did the assistant US attorney handling the referral decide not to prosecute? Why? If the referral resulted in formal charges, was the individual found guilty? What was the sentence?

These tens of thousands of individual records, obtained each year under the FOIA and analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), provide a unique window on the actual enforcement priorities of the federal government. The TRAC analysis proves that – despite all the heavy breathing of the National Association of Manufacturers and its political allies – the federal government almost never brings criminal charges against business.

In fiscal year 1994, for example, the government indicted more than 51,000 people. It will shock few Americans that more than a third of the cases – 20,000 – involved drugs. Given the commitment by Attorney General Janet Reno and her recent predecessors to fight a federal war against white-collar crime, however, it may come as a surprise how little the DoJ actually does in this area. Of the more than 51,000 federal criminal indictments in 1994, only 250, less than half of one per cent, involved criminal violations of the nation's environmental, occupational safety and health, and consumer product safety laws.

Given the huge number of corporations, the private admission by business lawyers that their organizations often break the law, and a well-documented record of repeated violations, the minuscule number of federal allegations of crime that involving pollution and the safety and health of workers and consumers hardly squares with the corporate view of business as the victim of a federal government run amok. And while the nation has a total of more than 3,000 criminal statutes and scores of heavily publicized enforcement programs for cleaning up the environment and protecting workers, the data show that individual federal prosecutors are looking elsewhere. They are concentrating their heaviest fire power on small-time drug dealers and immigrants rather than on corporate America.

The tiny number of people charged with criminal violation of environmental, occupational health, and consumer product safety laws is only one indication of the pro-business bias of the federal establishment revealed in the DoJ's own data. The difference in penalties for boardroom vs. street crime also showed a system-wide bias. Several years ago, Susan Long, my colleague at the TRAC, looked at data on the outcomes of all the criminal matters and cases disposed of by the Justice Department during a single sample week in 1993. Of the 18 disposals that touched upon the environment and public health that week, not one resulted in a prison sentence. Of the 695 disposals during the same period that were drug-related, almost half the defendants went to prison.

**Some Crime Pays**

Violations of workplace health and safety standards are similarly downplayed. The 1970 legislation that created OSHA gave it the authority to impose fines on employers who failed to provide safe working conditions. But the DoJ alone was given authority to institute criminal proceedings, and then, only if a worker died because an employer willfully violated federal safety standards. In the years since, the fines have typically been trivial, the criminal prosecutions exceedingly rare, and the human cost incalculable. With an acceptable and largely predictable risk, corporations can build in the cost of violating health and safety standards – all the while decrying overregulation.

Under five separate administrations – beginning with Nixon and extending to Clinton – the DoJ and the 90-plus US attorneys have been lead players in an unstated government policy that abets that calculation. In direct violation of the 1970 law, they have almost always protected from the unpleasant mess of criminal charges even those corporate executives who knowingly exposed workers to conditions that caused death.

Since 1970, ten million workers have suffered non-fatal on-the-job injuries. In 1987 alone, 50-70,000 workers died prematurely from on-the-job exposure to benzene, arsenic, asbestos, coal dust, vinyl chloride, dioxin, and other toxins – roughly three times the 21,500 people murdered that same year. Here is another perspective. Between 1970, when OSHA was created, and 1992, 200,000 Americans died at work. While some of these deaths were the consequence of worker carelessness or unavoidable mishaps, a significant number resulted from knowing negligence or greed by the employer.

Nonetheless, according to a 1992 study by OSHA, during those 22 years, the agency referred a grand total of 88 criminal cases to the Justice Department. On the basis of those referrals, federal prosecutors brought 25 criminal cases, and only one business executive was sent to prison. He served 45 days. The final toll: 200,000 dead, one executive in prison.

**Caution: Class Bias at Work**

Seen in this context, the propaganda campaign by business against overregulation is a red herring. It matters less how many unheeded regulations Congress passes than whom and what the law protects. Considered together, the data provide hard evidence of a powerful class bias in the US that works in favor of the rich and powerful and against the interests of workers. Congress covered its butt by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. But the actual impact of the law is greatly reduced by the insertion of a hard-to-enforce criminal section. Operating funds are voted for OSHA, but are insufficient to provide an effective force of well-trained and well-managed investigators. The Reagan and Bush administrations doubled the number of federal prosecutors, but ignored regulatory white-collar crimes to focus on the nonsensical "war on drugs."

At work is a complex and subtle systemic bias that almost no one wants to acknowledge. Every once in a while, however, probably by accident, one of the troops in America's class warfare blurts out the truth. A few years ago, Barry Hartman was first deputy, and then acting, assistant attorney general for the DoJ's Environmental and Natural Resources Division. The hot issue of the day was why the Department of Justice had stepped in to prevent a federal grand jury in Colorado from bringing criminal charges against the Rockwell Corporation, which had managed Rocky Flats, a government-owned weapons facility near Denver that had spilled massive quantities of dangerous pollutants into local rivers.

The decision to let Rockwell off the hook, Hartman told a reporter, was totally justified. "Environmental crimes are not like organized crimes or drugs," he declared. "There, you have bad people doing bad things. With environmental crimes you have decent people doing bad things. You have to look at it this way."

### Vigilante Justice: Common Law Courts

**by Devin Burghart and Robert Crawford**

With the stand-off between law enforcement officials and self-proclaimed "Freemen" near Jordan, Montana, the volatile white supremacist movement once again has captured the media spotlight. After the March 25 arrest of Freemen leaders LeRoy Schweitzer and Daniel Petersen on fraud and conspiracy charges, some 20 followers dug in for a siege at the ranch they renamed "Justus Township." Armed for combat with a stockpile of weapons and equipped with a fanatic commitment to battling federal and state jurisdiction, the group holed-up near the small Montana town.

While the media provided breathless blow-by-blow coverage of the stand-off, it largely has omitted any serious analysis of the social movement to which the Freemen belong. The Freemen's leadership role in applying one of the movement's recent tools for struggle – the so-called common law court – remains similarly unscrutinized. Also known as citizen grand juries, common law courts are self-elected vigilante organizations that claim for themselves the authority of law. The Freemen, along with their fellow travelers in the Christian Patriot movement, use these courts to declare themselves outside the jurisdiction of federal and state laws, issue harassing liens against the property of political opponents, and proclaim their right to arrest, judge, and even kill their opponents.

Court activists patch the courts together from models provided by "experts" and by improvising. The United Sovereigns of America, a leading national advocate of such courts with links to efforts in at least 13 states, provides one model. In it, a committee formed at a court training session votes to establish "Our One Supreme Court of Common Law" and selects "officers," typically court clerks, court justices (jurors), and a jury foreman. Once "impaneled," the court begins to hear cases. Because it is often a prerequisite for standing before the court, the most frequent early action is the "quiet title" – a declaration of independence from federal government jurisdiction. Once petitioners have become "sovereign," they may then use the court as a vehicle to launch paper attacks on private citizens and public officials. When these "sovereign citizens" bring a charge, the court claims power of investigation and calls accused parties to appear. If they refuse, the court generally finds them guilty in absentia and issues punishment – liens and threats of arrest, jailing, or death – to be enforced by the militia or "constable."

**Courts, Patriots, and Militias**

Since early 1994, and especially after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building last year, common law courts have become a defining feature of Christian Patriot strategy. To date, far-right advocates have set up common law courts in over 30 states. Their threats and harassing tactics are now an ominous part of the political landscape. In California and Florida, common law court activists face felony charges for veiled death threats to judges and jurors. In the last year, common law courts have issued arrest warrants for judges and prosecutors in Montana and Idaho. They have threatened sheriffs with violent reprisals if they fail to do their duty as interpreted by the militants.

The Freemen, led by Schweitzer, Petersen, and Rodney Skurdal, have played an important role in the development of this strategy, with an enormous impact on common law courts nationwide. According to the Justice Department, 800 people from 30 different states have attended Freemen training seminars – conducted while the Freemen faced state and federal felony charges. In the seminars, far rightists received nuts-and-bolts training in how to set up common law courts. In the year that the Freemen remained fugitives, they became an inspiration to common law court groups nationwide. "We recognize and appreciate the sacrifices and successes of those who have gone before, especially the work of those in Montana and Oklahoma," said one Oregon common law leader.

The courts share close ties with another spinoff of far-right traditions, the militias. Like many militias, these courts are, at their core, a tool for furthering the supremacist struggle to construct a white Christian republic on US soil. They weave conspiracy theories that scapegoat Jews and promote racist notions of citizenship. Their rhetorical and physical attacks on public officials and governmental agencies – rather than being a product of "anti-government" sentiment – is rooted in a vision of replacing existing governing institutions with their own.

**More than Militias**

That common law courts and militias are closely linked is no surprise; the two emerged from the same far-right terrain. In fact, movement leaders view the militias as the enforcement arm of the common law court. Oregon Christian Patriot figure "Johnny Liberty" (John Van Hove), told a regional movement gathering last fall, "... if the people who are using the laws and restoring the Constitutional courts do so in conjunction with the militia ... the militia will stand behind and defend the writs of those courts. That's a strategy that will work." In 1994, the Montana Freemen issued a "full alert" to "all our militia" to enforce the edicts of their court. Until a recent factional fight, the Freemen also had a close relationship with the white supremacist Militia of Montana. Meanwhile, Florida common law courts tried to enforce their edicts with threats from the Common Law Constitutional Militia.

A document sold by the United Sovereigns, *Militia Operation Plan American Viper*, details the role of militias in a prolonged guerrilla war against the US government. Militias should engage in "active high-level guerrilla operations" to eliminate "defended targets, larger troop concentrations and key leaders." Targets are to be eliminated by "sniper tactics," "explosives," "ambushes," or "chemical and biological agents." The plan foresees the need to "establish temporary martial law under the Militia" until it can "reestablish original Constitutional government."

The close relationship between militias and common law courts results from their common origins. Both are part of a system of parallel institutions constituting an embryonic alternative government for organized racists and anti-Semites. Like the militias, the courts' historical roots go back to the Posse Comitatus, a racist, anti-Semitic paramilitary organization that targeted farmers in the 1980s.

**The Posse Reborn**

Militias and common law courts clearly bear the Posse's mark. As heirs to the Posse's legacy of violence, common law court activists have wholeheartedly embraced intimidation as a political tactic. They also use the Posse's key texts and incendiary language. The United Sovereigns, a leading common law court group, sells the Posse's *Blue Book* and use it as a training manual. The Montana Freemen's "full alert" in 1994 called on "all our militia, our posse in and for Garfield county/comitatus" to give "aid to our special Constables" in enforcing their edicts. A "township" in Littlefield, Arizona, claims to have its own "Legislature, Executive, Judiciary, Grand Juries, Juries (and) Posse." Idaho common law court "notices of arrest," issued to public officials and others, declared that "Pursuant to the law of the POSSE COMITATUS, should you fail in the discharge of your sworn duty (i.e., to arrest those charged by the court), WE the PEOPLE shall bring you to JUSTICE under the Law of the POSSE COMITATUS."

Common law courts also receive guidance from prominent Posse figures. In Smithville, Arkansas, Leonard Ginter reportedly leads a common law court. Ginter was a prominent Wisconsin Posse leader in the early 1980s and is best known for hiding notorious Posse member Gordon Kahl while he was a federal fugitive. Another Posse holdover, Gene Schroder, a leader in the Colorado-based American Agricultural Movement, attended 1982 paramilitary training sessions led by Posse leader William Potter Gale. Now Schroder is close to the United Sovereigns and has been involved in several prominent common law court meetings.

**Sowing Hate: The Posse Comitatus**

Embracing a form of populist ultra-nationalism and a will to violence, the Posse Comitatus ("power of the county") movement arose in the West and Midwest. It flourished briefly in the early 1980s until the federal government's concerted efforts and counter-organizing by progressives contained it. Despite the Posse's fleeting existence, its ideas and tactics continue to influence far-right circles.

While the Freemen, among others, draw heavily on the Posse legacy, the Posse in turn fed on the long tradition of the US far-right. Among the leaders was Henry "Mike" Beach, the author of the Posse bible, the *Blue Book*. Years before his Posse ties, Beach cast his lot with William Dudley Pelly's Silver Shirts, an anti-Semitic group modeled on the Nazi brownshirts. Beach was not the only Posse leader with a racist, anti-Semitic pedigree. According to Daniel Levitas, who is writing a book on the Posse, "while Mike Beach helped launch the early Posse as an organization, credit for inspiring the original concept really belongs with another man, retired Army Lt. Col. William Potter Gale." Gale, who served under Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines, was an early leader in the Christian Identity movement, which holds that white Northern Europeans are God's chosen race, Jews are the Devil's spawn, and all others are subhuman "mud people."

The Posse's mix of Christian Identity, anti-government fervor, and conspiracy theory proved highly combustible, and the farm crisis of the 1980s, when a full quarter of family farms went under, provided the tinder. For beleaguered farmers asking who was to blame, the Posse gave the answers: The Federal Reserve Bank – an instrument of an International Jewish Banking Conspiracy – was the main cause of the suffering of white Christian Americans, particularly farmers.

Posse leaders offered phony loan schemes, bigoted conspiracy theories and, when all else failed, armed confrontation as the solution to farmers' problems. In the early 1980s, in a posture reminiscent of the Nazi brownshirts, Posse members made threats, advocated violence to advance the cause, and ran paramilitary training camps. In Kansas, a man identifying himself as a Posse member threatened to bomb a school unless the sheriff and deputy turned themselves over for execution. In November 1983, over 100 county sheriffs in Kansas received letters demanding the arrest of ten judges for ordering the seizure of private property.

But Posse activities went beyond bluster. In 1983, a Colorado court convicted three Posse members of manufacturing explosives. And in a notorious incident in North Dakota in February 1983, several Posse members led by Gordon Kahl killed two federal marshals in a shootout. Kahl himself died months later in a fiery showdown after state and federal authorities cornered him in Arkansas. Now, more than a decade after Kahl's death, the Posse's spirit rises once again in militias, common law courts, and supremacist Christian sects across the country.

**A Theology of Genocide**

Whatever issues common law court activists play up, their strategy remains deeply rooted in the white supremacist movement. The Montana Freemen provide a prime example. Speaking in late 1995 at a training meeting at "Justus Township," LeRoy Schweitzer spelled out just who could occupy the seats of government: "This is in the family. Israel. The lost sheep. The select, the elect, the peculiar treasure, the royal priesthood, the Aryans, the battle ax. There's some 50 names for God's people in the Bible. This is it. The King's Bench."

Similarly, in a rambling 20-page document written in November 1994, for the Freemen's common law court, Rodney Skurdal spells out his belief in Christian Identity and, echoing Posse founder Gale, concludes: "God is not a God unto the other races, but only that of Israel, the white race"; Jews "were fathered by Satan"; and people of color are the "beasts of the field" of Genesis. Skurdal then appropriates Leviticus 20:15-16 to argue for the execution of interracial couples: "If a woman approaches any beast [i.e., person of color] and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death." He concludes with a genocidal fantasy frequently found in Christian Identity, "nor are we to make any covenants with the other races when we move into a new land, we are to kill all of the inhabitants of the other races."

The Freemen are not alone in their bigotry. A training tape sold by United Sovereigns purports to "expose those who are called Jews and have no genetic or racial ties to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" and "are of the synagogue of Satan." United Sovereigns also sells a tract by a North Carolina Christian Identity leader which reads in part, "from the very earliest records of Scripture, we again have Talmudic Jews ruling over us from behind the scenes." They also peddle the notorious anti-Semitic tract and long-unmasked forgery, *The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion*.

**Second Class Citizens**

While Christian Identity is the most virulent dogma expressed by the common law court activists, the most frequent form of Patriot bigotry is its racist definition of citizenship. As the *Free[man] Newsletter* explains, its quest is for "political sovereignty," described as the "self-determinate will of the organic (white, Adam, Israel, people)." The "We the People" referred to in the Constitution, the newsletter continues, is "the white race and none other"; the 14th Amendment – which extended basic citizenship rights to all – "created a second class of citizen, Blacks and Aliens." The bogus distinction between the rights of (white) "state" citizens and 14th Amendment citizens occurs time and again in the documents filed by common law court activists. Many describe the legal basis for the courts as "our organic law," a reference to the Christian Patriot notion that the US should be reconstructed under the "organic" Constitution – the original Constitution and Bill of Rights minus, among others, the 13th and 14th Amendments.

**One Hand Washes the Other**

Far from being "anti-government," militia and common law court activists are decidedly pro-government, if and only if such a government resembles that of the pre-Civil War South. As such, the Christian Patriots' relationship with the state and status quo is contradictory. Their attacks on immigrant rights, affirmative action, taxation, welfare, and property regulation resonate among broad segments of US society. And their claim that the government has abandoned (white) middle America in favor of an "alien" element (non-whites) is only the frank expression of white privilege usually voiced in coded form.

Noting the pervasiveness of such sentiments, the mainstream political parties seek to co-opt them. By simultaneously adopting core arguments of the racist right, such as the canard that African American teenage mothers are responsible for the "welfare mess," while attacking overt racism, politicians render respectable a rhetoric more suited to a Klan rally than a presidential campaign.

At the same time, Christian Patriots are radically opposed to democratic institutions of any stripe. The present system, though decidedly skewed in favor of the wealthy and the white, grants political rights to women and people of color and allows for political pluralism. For Patriots seeking an exclusively white Christian republic, both parties – veritable bastions of pluralism compared to the Patriots – stand in the way. The struggle for economic and racial justice in the United States demands a broad and unified opposition to this latest tool of the far right. Progressives must both oppose organized racists as a distinct movement and struggle to erase the more subtle racism that permeates our institutions.

### Behind the Razor Wire: Inside INS Detention Centers

**by Mark Dow**

"Personally, I don't know the laws of this country. I would like to know if they have the right to hit me [for] being a Haitian political refugee."

Behind the deafening noise of anti-immigrant hysteria, the Department of Justice's Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is quietly going about its business. And "business" is the word. On any given day, the INS has approximately 5,000 "aliens" in its custody. It holds them not only in its own nine Service Processing Centers, and in contract facilities operated by Wackenhut Corrections Corporation and the Corrections Corporation of America, but also in some 900 local jails across the country. The INS claims that overcrowding in its detention centers is the reason for transfers to other facilities, but detainees claim that the transfers are also used as a form of intimidation and punishment. And while the corrections companies and local jails are profiting, the INS is able to diffuse its already meager accountability while it persists in longstanding patterns of abuse and mistreatment of undocumented people.

In 1992-93, during the large influx of political refugees from Haiti, INS transferred hundreds of Haitians from Miami to jails in northern Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. The agency paid the Leon County, Florida, Sheriff's Department between $40 and $50 per jailed Haitian woman per day, about the national average. The Sheriff's Department was hoping to get a contract for another 200 refugees, which would bring in $3.6 million a year, and net a $2 million profit.

**$$ and Detention**

Detention-for-profit began before the Haitian-Cuban influx and continues today. Avoyelles Parish in Louisiana gets $45 a day from the federal government for each of its 147 aliens – including Cubans who, because of criminal convictions, the US refuses to release and Cuba refuses to take back. "In a good year – when the parish has housed hundreds of illegals at a time – that adds $2 to $3 million to its $8 million budget," the *New York Times* reported. With that profit, the sheriff has provided ambulance service to the parish, increased his detective force, and given his deputies raises. Dallas County, Texas, is also projecting profits from INS contracts. A Mississippi sheriff said, "We don't always agree with the INS holding them but we like the money."

It is not just the fees. Take Louisiana's Oakdale detention center, the largest INS detention facility in the country. Run jointly with the Bureau of Prisons, it opened in March 1986, after heavy lobbying from local officials and citizens. Unemployment in Oakdale had risen to 31.9 percent after a paper mill, the area's largest employer, closed down. The mayor hoped that the detention center would be a recession-proof industry, and expected it to bring 315 new jobs with an average salary of $24,000 a year for a town with an average annual income of $7000. It didn't matter that there were no immigration attorneys in Oakdale, or that, according to a survey by the American Civil Liberties Union, only three out of 650 attorneys in the area would be able or willing to offer volunteer services to the detainees.

In 1993, Chinese refugees from *The Golden Venture*, a ship which ran aground in New York, were in the York County, Pennsylvania, prison. (Most of them remain jailed today, at York and elsewhere.) At the time, a county commissioner "joked" that bids need not be taken for certain county works projects, since "We've got the labor force to do it in prison." "You're thinking of those Asian guys," responded another official.

Federal officials are serious about exploiting detainee labor. The US refugee camps at Guantánamo have officially closed, but the Defense Department is apparently considering "a move from a total DoD to a DoD-contracted civilian operation." And part of the plan is to put asylum-seekers to work: "Skilled and qualified migrants will be identified and employed with the goal of rotating the work force to provide equitable employment. Migrants will be paid the Caribbean region wage rate. Payment can be via a centralized accounting system and administratively maintained so as to prevent migrants from having excessive cash money in the camps."

As cheap, controlled labor, perhaps the "migrants" will feel they haven't strayed so far from home after all.

**A Pattern of Abuse**

Political refugees may also find their treatment by US authorities frighteningly familiar. A Nigerian held in INS detention in Forest Park, Georgia, "must crawl about on the ground," because he is denied crutches and proper medical care for a spinal condition. For three years, some detainees at the INS Varick Street facility in Manhattan were kept from going outdoors. At the INS's Port Isabel detention center in Texas, a guard kicked a Cuban detainee who, after guards did not respond, tried to help a Honduran who was having an epileptic seizure.

In a Pennsylvania jail with which the INS contracts, a Somali woman seeking political asylum after her brothers and father were assassinated was beaten by a female guard. On another occasion, when she asked for a blanket because she was cold, the woman was told to put her request in writing, and then was denied a pencil. And at Miami's Krome detention center, according to a Nigerian detainee, a guard walked into the men's sleeping area, pulled down his pants, and "asked if we're man enough to fuck his ass ... [if not] he'll fuck our ass."

The cycles of repression and resistance common to many of the regimes from which refugees are fleeing are often echoed in INS detention. In March, INS detainees set fires at the Miramar Naval Air Station brig near San Diego to protest conditions. The 174 detainees were there by arrangement between the Navy, the Justice Department, and the Kentucky-based US Corrections Corporation.

In June 1995, the INS contract facility run by the Esmor Corporation in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was closed after an uprising by detainees protesting indefinite detention, inhumane conditions, and guard brutality. About two dozen of the detainees were transferred to the Union County Jail in Elizabeth, where they were subjected to a gauntlet by guards who kicked and punched them, pushed heads into toilets, "and forced a line of men to kneel naked ... and chant, 'America is Number One.' "

The INS issued a report admitting that it should have had more oversight of the Esmor facility. While the INS's forthright criticism of Esmor was welcome, it only highlights the fact that for years the agency has ignored similar complaints about mistreatment in its own facilities. The list is long and familiar: physical and sexual abuse, verbal abuse, arbitrary and punitive use of solitary confinement, transfers to remote facilities, inadequate medical care, and interference with attorney-client communication. The categories recur in complaints from around the country.

**Krome: Hidden From View**

The Krome North Service Processing Center, an isolated INS detention facility at the edge of the Everglades in Miami, has a particularly notorious history of brutality and invisibility. This January, Miami INS District Director Walter Cadman turned down a request by a group of 11 writers and photojournalists to tour Krome. Spokesperson Lamar Wooley explained that "nothing unusual has happened or is happening to warrant this type of coverage. ... Obviously there has to be a reason to disrupt the routine at the Krome facility." The group, which included representatives of the national and local mainstream media and me, has appealed the decision to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner.

A few years ago, the INS denied access to a delegation from the Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee and Physicians for Human Rights. The group had received permission from INS officials in Washington and Miami to enter Krome and speak with detainees. After arriving in Miami, they were told that Miami INS had "countermanded" the initial decision "after consultation" with Washington. As a result, the delegation's April 1991 report – aptly entitled *Hidden from View* – was based largely on affidavits and statements collected by local advocates. The Haitian Refugee Center, with help from the American Friends Service Committee and a small group of private attorneys, had documented charges of abuses at Krome in 1989, 1990, and 1991. The pressure of publicity eventually led to an FBI investigation on behalf of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. Results of the inquiry, which began in May 1990, have never been released.

In fact, a journalist who asked the Justice Department for those results this year was sent only a press release about an incident unrelated to the earlier investigation. But the press release does provide an official acknowledgment of a story that has a familiar ring to advocates. It announces that a Krome officer "has pled guilty to one felony count of ... depriving a [Haitian] detainee ... of his civil rights." Specifically, "after a verbal incident in the cafeteria," the Krome officer, Edward Calejo: "escorted the detainee to the dormitory building and placed him in a small cell. Inside the cell Calejo, without warning or lawful justification, punched Bernard in the head. Calejo then kicked Bernard and punched him multiple times about the head and body.... Later that day, in an effort to cover up what he had done, Calejo had other guards punch him in the chest and photograph the resulting injury to support a false report claiming Bernard was the aggressor. He also made attempts to persuade a witness to support his false report and tried to get the FBI to begin an investigation of the detainee."

**Toothless Watchdogs**

The attempted cover-up fits a pattern of "counter-charges" described by Americas Watch (now Human Rights Watch/Americas) in its reports of violence on the US-Mexico border. "[B]eatings or other abuses" by immigration officials often occur after a person is "arrested, handcuffed, and subdued. By charging beating victims with assault on a federal officer and other felony charges, the agents sought to conceal their own misdeeds."

The press statement goes on to claim that this case "shows the ability of the federal government to police itself when confronted with criminal misconduct." The record suggests otherwise. Since September 1994, the American Friends Service Committee Immigration Law Enforcement Monitoring Project (AFSC/ILEMP) in the Rio Grande Valley has filed 64 complaints – about half of them related to the Port Isabel detention center with the Justice Department's watchdog agency, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Not a single one has even been acknowledged. Of the 35 cases detailed in a recent AFSC/ILEMP report from San Diego, not one has been prosecuted. Some have been referred for "administrative review," says advocate Leticia Jimenez, "which is where we lose track ... [because] we don't know what that means." Unfortunately, many advocates around the country often fail to follow up on their own complaints; but then, the complaint system seems designed precisely to instill that sense of futility.

The OIG, according to Human Rights Watch/Americas, lacks both resources and independence. "Many OIG investigators are former Border Patrol or INS agents," and "[a]pproximately 98 percent of INS abuse cases eventually are handled by the INS itself, but the outcome of such referrals [from the OIG] is not known to anyone outside the agency." The OIG can decide to refer cases to the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, but the standard for prosecutions (undertaken with local US Attorneys' offices, and investigated by the FBI) is extremely restrictive. "The remarkably small number of cases brought to a grand jury is striking, even taking into account the high standard of proof demanded in federal criminal prosecutions." Of 1,322 referrals from the INS to the Civil Rights Division from October 1988 through September 1994, only 16 were sent to a grand jury. Of these, nine were prosecuted, resulting in six guilty pleas, two acquittals, and one conviction.

Of course, these numbers do not include all those victims who have been dissuaded from filing complaints, or who decided that it wasn't worth the effort. Incredibly, the INS itself has acknowledged "that even sustained complaints are not considered when INS personnel are under consideration for promotion or transfer."

Publicity about abuses led INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to announce formation of the INS Citizens' Advisory Panel (CAP) in March 1995. But contrary to the original announcement, at its first meeting the CAP decided against receiving specific cases; instead it will refer them to the OIG. The CAP is "allowing the INS to set the agenda," for the meetings, according to Allyson Collins of Human Rights Watch/Americas, who has attended three of the four held so far. The INS wants control of the complaint process, says Collins, and there is a danger the panel – even though it is well-intentioned – will endorse the agency's drive for more internal control of the complaint process. That would be consistent with the agency's "insistence on maintaining a system of secret law." The only real solution, as many advocates have pointed out, would be meaningful, independent review of the INS – including regular, surprise monitoring of detention facilities.

**Continuing Abuses**

At Krome, the detainees have issued many cries for help over the years, and today they are making themselves heard again. In a letter sent to the INS and to local media in January, more than 150 men wrote of severe overcrowding and unsanitary bathroom conditions. They also wrote of being locked out of bathrooms "like pigs in a sty," and of receiving a change of clothes only once a week (Krome inmates must wear bright orange uniforms).

A subsequent letter from Nigerian detainee Ope-Agbe A. Bariu includes familiar complaints about medical care and abuse by guards: "The officers here talk to and threaten all detainees. They say that they are God over us, and show no sign of respect. They put us through all sorts of emotional distress. If you as a detainee try to point this out to them, you get transported out of Krome, to any county jail of their choice." Underlying all of this is the basic fact of life at Krome: "The lack of communications on each detainee's case, as well as the long periods for which they are being held is a serious issue. Apart from the mental stress and psychological torture we face every day by the officers, the long periods we have to wait for our case[s] gives us a lot more stress."

Bariu himself spent some 14 months at Krome, and in that time was transferred back and forth to about six county jails in Florida. The day after his name appeared in a *Miami Herald* story on Krome, INS Lt. Frank Ferguson approached him. "You put up a good show ... I saw your handiwork," Bariu says the officer told him. Bariu was in the clinic for chest pains, and a number of immigration officials came by to see him there, to put a face with the name; Public Health Service employees – technically a separate entity from the INS – pointed him out to INS officials, says Bariu. Five days later, Bariu was transferred to the Monroe County Jail in Key West.

But "before they did take me, they beat the shit out of me," he said by phone from the jail. A group led by Ferguson and including eight officers "rushed" Bariu when he said he was not a criminal, should not be handcuffed, and asked for time to collect his files from a Krome administrator. He reported injuries to his head, ribs, shoulder, face, and knee. "I didn't provoke it," he said. Then, with his hands cuffed behind his back and legs shackled, he was taken to the clinic, where, says Bariu, an INS officer told a clinic employee "to get the doctors to write ... [that] he got into a fight here, that's why we're shipping him out." He remained cuffed and shackled while he was given an EKG. In the clinic, Ferguson allegedly told him, "The only way you're going to stay here in Krome is over my dead body." "They intimidate people there at Krome," Bariu said. "That's why none of those guys want to say anything. ... They're scared." In March, Bariu was transferred to the Avoyelles jail in Marksville, Louisiana, his arms and legs shackled for the bus ride. "Well, they have just showed me a new form of their extreme and limitless power," he wrote from Louisiana. Referring to the "revolving door" of immigrants at the jail, a secretary there said, "it's not good to let them stay in the same place together for long... they tend to want to get their heads together." Soon after, Bariu was deported to Nigeria.

**Racism and Unaccountability**

The persistent lack of accountability at Krome is as clear as ever. Frank Ferguson, the officer who targeted Bariu, has been the object of complaints before. In 1991, Nigerian Tony Ebibillo was among a group of detainees who lined up to show their blue plastic identification cards to an officer who was checking to see who was eligible for release. When Ebibillo reached the front of the line, he later said, Lt. Ferguson told him, "Get the fuck out of my face. You Nigerians, I can only help you to stay in Krome and not to get out."

Today, Bariu's accusation sounds familiar: Ferguson "dislikes Africans but hates Nigerians in particular, with a passion," he wrote. "His reason being that Nigerians feel like they know it all and they are a little bit too smart for themselves. These are his words to the Nigerian detainees at Krome." In February, there were nine Nigerians held at Krome, according to the official, "I had a staff person at Krome tell me how we don't like to [release] Nigerians because they lie – it's part of their culture."

A Liberian at Krome said recently: "There's a lot of politics going on here in Krome against the Africans. We have no one here to fight for us. ... We are being rejected here as we are all over the continent [of Europe]." He fears the repercussions of speaking publicly, and added, "We are really scared here because our life is just nothing to them here."

The discrimination extends to INS officers who try to help Africans. Archie L. Graham worked as an INS investigator in Philadelphia in the 1980's. He told the *New York Times* that he felt particularly uneasy with two agents called "the African killers" because they singled out black immigrants from Nigeria and Sierra Leone. "They went out specially for them, and they'd tear up their papers and throw them away. I didn't go along with it. I'd say, 'That's not right.' They'd say: 'You don't like it, go back where you came from. Go back to Africa. We'll deport you.' "

At different times, different groups have been especially vulnerable to the INS. But anyone who falls into INS custody is in danger of disappearing into a culture of brutality and discrimination. While individual guards – often badly trained and poorly paid – are responsible for their actions, they are carrying out policies that officials at the highest levels have condoned by mouthing politically expedient anti-immigrant sentiments and by remaining silent about well-documented patterns of abuse.

When told of the INS's refusals to grant access to the press and other investigators, one Nigerian at Krome gave this assessment: "That means the same thing that's happening in my country is happening here," he said. "You try to stand up for anything, they knock you down."

### AND THE AMERICAN WAY ON EARTH AS IT IS IN THE HEAVENS

**Betting on Boris: The West Antes Up for the Russian Elections**

**by Fred Weir**

Yeltsin's popularity is falling and the Communists are gaining in the polls as elections in Russia near. Enter the leaders of the free world, arm in arm, checkbooks in hand, eager to ensure a victory by the man they have long relied on to carry their free-market water.

In the runup to Russia's June elections, Western leaders have broken normal diplomatic protocol to express strong public support for President Boris Yeltsin and have anted up a total of almost $14 billion in loans, much of which will be used to bankroll the incumbent's lavish campaign promises. Whether or not these elections take place as planned – and there is much speculation about cancellation or postponement – the extent of foreign influence is noteworthy.

Russia is scheduled to go to the polls on June 16 for the first round of elections to choose a new president. Some 17 candidates are registered, but none is expected to attract the 50 percent of votes required to win outright. The two front runners will face each other in a second round, probably on July 8, which will determine the final winner. Virtually all public opinion surveys predict that the second-round contenders will be Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov, leader of Russia's resurgent Communist Party, which led the polls in December's parliamentary elections.

Many in the West have reacted with alarm at the prospect of a Communist comeback in Russia barely five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But with Yeltsin's popularity eroded by economic and social decline, the Communist Party appears capable of winning the presidency – if the vote is free and fair.

**Free and Fair vs. Pricey and Packed**

These elections are Russia's first experience with the full barrage of US-style campaign techniques, from professional PR operations to negative ads, from promises of universal prosperity to large infusions of cash distributed to key constituencies around the country. And as in the US, these costly tactics will play a large part in determining the outcome of the vote.

Yeltsin has taken to pork barrel politics like a tsar to caviar. He opened his re-election campaign with promises to pay 7.8 trillion rubles ($1.6 billion) in back wages owed by the federal government to public sector workers. He also pledged to make cheap credits available to Russian regions to help clear a staggering $4 billion backlog of unpaid salaries to workers in privatized industries. During March, the president signed a string of decrees to raise pensions and student benefits, finance cash-strapped educational institutions, fund scientific research, and rebuild war-torn Chechnya. The initial price tag for these promises has been variously estimated at between $9 and $16 billion.

On the campaign trail, as he throws money at potential supporters, Yeltsin mixes what the *New York Times* described as "the hauteur of incumbency with carefully staged demonstrations of compassion and munificence." In early May, he promised a Tatar leader he met on the street $50,000 to open a new Muslim cultural center. During a visit to a Russian Orthodox convent he gave $10,000 from his treasury to help cover the nuns' housekeeping costs.

**Friends in Deed**

Although some of his promises are so much flimflam, others have been, or likely will be implemented. But even without additional expenditures, Russian state revenues were running far below projections as the country faces a crumbling infrastructure, a shredded social safety net, and mounting debts. Experts describe tax collection in Russia's lawless marketplace as "abysmal." Income from sales of Russian treasury bills is nowhere near expectations, despite interest rates on the six-month bonds of up to 165 percent.

To make up its gaping budgetary deficit and pay for campaign promises, the Yeltsin regime has turned to foreign sources of financing. And Western leaders have responded with almost unprecedented generosity. In February, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited Moscow and offered a special credit of four billion marks ($2.7 billion), three-quarters of which was extended without conditions on its use. At the same time, he showed support for the current president. "Under Boris Yeltsin's leadership," Kohl told journalists, "despite all the difficulties, Russia has set out on the road to democracy, rule of law and a market economy." Within days, French Prime Minister Alain Juppé provided Yeltsin an additional loan of two billion francs ($392 million), paid entirely into Russian state coffers.

In May 1996, a Japanese consortium of major trading houses and shipping firms announced its first large-scale project in Russia since the fall of the USSR. With help from the Japanese and Russian governments, they plan a port development project in Russia's Far East. The aim, said Japanese officials, "is to spur Russia's economy and support the Yeltsin administration ahead of the Russian presidential election scheduled for June."

Secretary of State Warren Christopher dispelled any doubt about where the US stands when he visited Moscow to lay the groundwork for the G-7 summit on nuclear safety held in the Kremlin in mid-April. In an interview with Russian journalists, he made Washington's views on the upcoming election crystal clear: "I am sure that President Clinton will come here to follow basically the line that he has followed ever since the beginning of his presidency. That is to support the reforms and to support those who are enthusiastic about reform and who are carrying out reforms. That has brought him into strong support for President Yeltsin on prior occasions."

A few days later, on March 26, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a three-year, $10.3 billion credit to Russia, "front-loaded" to deliver almost half the amount in 1996. The first installment, $350 million, was paid at the end of March. This IMF loan is the second biggest in history, after last year's $17.8 billion Mexico bailout. On May 1, the World Bank joined in and approved a $200 million loan aimed at bolstering Russia's social services. Although the US dominates the Bank and the IMF and often runs roughshod over the other members, in this case it did not have to twist arms. The industrialized countries formed a solid bloc behind Yeltsin.

As is generally the case, IMF and World Bank support ensured special consideration by other lending institutions. A month after the IMF loan, the Paris Club, made up of Western European countries plus the US, Japan, and Australia, gave Yeltsin a boost with the largest rescheduling deal in the club's 40-year history. And instead of the usual maximum of 18 years, they gave Russia 25 years to pay back its $40 billion debt. The Club conditioned the agreement on Russia's compliance with IMF guidelines that effectively "lock any future Russian government, even one led by the Communists should they win a presidential election in June, into a reform program."

The IMF agreement also spurred discussions between Russia and the 600 creditor banks which comprise the Club of London. In November 1995, this creditor group had rescheduled 25 years' worth of debt, inherited from the Soviet Union – a total of $32.5 billion – starting with a seven-year moratorium on repayments. After the IMF decision, the Club of London reopened negotiation for an additional round of rescheduling.

**IMF Futures**

While these lenient terms and extensions give Yeltsin some breathing room to deal with economic crisis and mounting debts, the IMF is providing hard cash. Some of the Fund's money is earmarked for special projects, but the bulk goes directly into the state treasury, where it can be disbursed by Yeltsin and the Russian government any way they wish. "It is extraordinary that this money is being rendered for discretionary spending by the government, rather than being linked to specific goals," writes Sergei Glazyev, leader of the left-wing Democratic Party of Russia. "And the speed with which it is coming into the country indicates that it will be available for Yeltsin to temporarily increase social spending before the election."

Yeltsin, for his part, saw the cash infusion as nothing less than his due after years of cooperation with US-designed economic reforms. Before the loan was finalized, he made clear he had expected the money: "It would be treason for the World Bank and the IMF not to support Russia at this stage," he said in February.

Michel Camdessus, the IMF chief, brushed aside suggestions the organization was favoring Yeltsin's candidacy in the upcoming election – without actually denying it. "Not to support Russia now also could be viewed as taking sides, and would be equally wrong," he said. "It is our... moral obligation to support this government."

Putting a finer point on it, Mr. Camdessus warned that the IMF money could be withdrawn if a Communist wins the June election. "If they are consistent with a communist approach," he said, "then indeed agreement would be impossible and then we would have to suspend our support." He specifically warned that any attempts to re-nationalize private industry would halt the flow of IMF credit. The IMF's deal with Russia "states clearly that the government will not re-nationalize or increase the share of the government in privatized companies," and that any attempt to do so would be a breach of agreement, he said.

**Second Thoughts**

Limited re-nationalization is precisely what the Communist Party program calls for. Recognizing the enormous social and economic dislocation and the current disrepair of the economy, the Communists advocate placing raw materials and strategic industry under public ownership. They also propose subjecting some of the most questionable deals in Russia's two-year-old privatization campaign to legal review. These measures send chills through Russia's new economic elite, which not only has the economic clout to defend its status, but maintains well-armed private armies employing up to 600,000 men.

Many Russian economists have pointed out that the Yeltsin privatization campaign, particularly its hasty and deeply corrupt second stage, transferred some of the country's richest assets to a tiny handful of well-connected plutocrats. Even the original architect of Russia's "shock therapy" program, Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, recently decried privatization's second stage as "a remarkable plunder of state assets." The second stage of privatization appears to have delivered literally tens of billions of dollars in state assets in the oil, gas, and metals sector to powerful insiders in the government, the banks and the enterprises. In an unprecedented comment to the English-language *Moscow Times*, the intellectual father of Russia's market reforms called for "a reversal of last year's natural resource privatizations, on the grounds of social equity and rule of law."

By tying its support explicitly to the irreversibility of privatization, the IMF is setting conditions that alienate a wide swath of Russian public opinion, from outraged liberals to tough-minded Communists. Boris Yeltsin, who authorized the privatizations in a series of special presidential decrees, is the only force on the political spectrum with a clear interest in leaving the one-sided division of spoils in place.

But despite some queasiness, Washington is backing Yeltsin all the way. This episode is the latest in a long history of US interference in foreign elections: from Japan in the 1940s, to Italy in the 1950s, to Chile in the 1970s, to Nicaragua in the 1980s, to Russia today. Were the same level of financial and political "aid" used by a foreign power to exert pressure on a US election, it would be denounced as outrageous intervention. In Russia today, it appears to be just the way free and fair elections work – or don't.

### Haiti: The "Uncivil" Society

**by Noam Chomsky**

Part II of a speech given in Washington, D.C. in December 1995 to benefit CAQ. Part I appeared in the Spring 1996 issue of CAQ.

Explaining how the Clinton Doctrine moves from containment of the attack on global democracies to enlargement of their reach, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake offered the example of US achievements in Haiti as a clear illustration of the "immense opportunities" that the "new world" offers us "to consolidate the victory of democracy and open markets." He was speaking in September 1994, when US forces landed to "restore democracy" after the failure of harsh sanctions to induce the military junta to resign.

A year later, doubts were emerging about the success of the noble mission. *New York Times* correspondent Barbara Crossette warned of the difficulty in overcoming "old habits and hatreds" that remain despite our most dedicated efforts to bring democracy and justice. One "cautionary tale" is offered by Cambodia. Here, we entered with "good intentions" when the country was "barely alive after decades of civil war, genocide, and foreign occupation" – but evidently untouched by perhaps the most intense bombing of civilians in history from 1969 to 1975, by some unknown hand, the first phase of what the only independent government inquiry (Finland) calls the "Decade of Genocide," when 600,000 people were killed, according to the CIA, and hundreds of thousands driven from their homes, flooding Phnom Penh, where reporters carefully avoided their reports of what was happening under the bombs in inner Cambodia. Crossette also warns about Haiti, another "cautionary tale" where our "good intentions" may be undercut by "home-grown distrust, poverty and demagogy." These backward Haitians somehow distrust US good intentions despite all the blessings we've lavished on them for 200 years – maybe it's their bad genes. The point was elaborated by the *New York Times*' leading thinker, Thomas Friedman, the same day in a column called: "Think Haiti." He says Haiti is "a cautionary tale about limits" of our ability to do good. We "did the right thing in Haiti," he says, but President Aristide may not have "abandoned his populist radical impulses," and he's dragging his feet on handing over Haiti's remaining assets to foreign investors, so we've had to cancel unpaid parts of the promised aid, since obviously we can't tolerate that.

Lippman explained that the "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders," meaning the general population, have to be kept out of the public arena. They can be "spectators" but not "participants." And the Haitians in their ignorant ways didn't understand that, so they needed a few lessons in democracy. That's another unspeakable "enduring truth," in the words of Anthony Lake.

Well, what Clinton has, in fact, done is to restore the situation to what it was prior to the free election of 1990, which was a disaster because the democratic, popular forces actually participated and got their own conception of socio-economic development and their own representative in power. That, then, had to be overthrown by violence, and in fact, the current program is virtually identical to that advocated by Washington's candidate in the 1990 election, Marc Bazin, a World Bank official who received 14 percent of the vote, but is now effectively in power thanks to our restoration of democracy – at least his program is in power. Well, those are more "enduring truths" which you're not supposed to know about. It's kind of interesting that Haiti, the most impoverished country in the hemisphere, is still dragging its feet. It's among the few countries where people are actually struggling against these structural adjustment-style programs which are also being applied to us.

Friedman goes on to say that we can't even be sure that we can trust the police in Haiti, even though they've been "put through US human rights courses," as in Colombia and El Salvador and Indonesia and other paragons of virtue. Like 100 percent of his colleagues, Friedman refrains from giving us a little background about Aristide's "radical populist impulses," which we thought we'd overcome by returning him on condition that he accept Washington's socio-economic program, which is public, though you wouldn't know it from the press. The core element, the core sentence of the program on which he was restored is the following: "The renovated state in Haiti must focus on an economic strategy centered on the energy and initiative of civil society, especially the private sector, both national and foreign." In other words, the rich families living up in the suburbs who supported the coup and investors in New York City are Haitian civil society, and the renovated state must focus on their interests, not on those of the people in the slums of Port-au-Prince or the peasants in the hills, since they are not Haitian civil society. And although he did sign on to this, Aristide's populist radical impulses are still not squelched entirely, so he apparently is dragging his feet a little bit on this forthcoming program.

The people who swept Aristide into office had a different conception of Haitian civil society, and that, of course, has to be beaten out of their heads. They also had an unacceptable concept of democracy. They had this weird idea that the general public actually has a role to play in the way affairs of state are conducted. That's contrary to two centuries of doctrine in the US, which goes right back to Madison and the framing of the Constitution, and is expressed in more modern times by leading Wilsonian liberals like Walter Lippmann. That's a pretty dramatic fact. The idea that we should go to Haiti to teach them about democracy is so ludicrous that one hardly knows how to comment. Maybe we ought to go there to learn something about democracy, but that's about the only relationship as far as democracy goes.

Anyway, we're supposed to see the Haitian experience as a cautionary note about our ability. And what is our ability? Well, in reality, it's our ability to destroy democracy, to intensify miserable poverty and suffering, and to enrich Haitian "civil society" sitting in the wealthy suburbs of Port-au-Prince or in corporate boardrooms in New York. You're going to have to look pretty hard for the actual facts, which incidentally are not in dispute, I don't urge you to waste your time looking, because you won't find them unless you go way out to the margins.

Honesty requires that we recognize that there is a discordant note in this chorus of self-adulation about Haiti. This discordant note is worth looking at closely because it teaches a lot about how a really well-oiled propaganda system works. In the December 8 *New York Times*, there's an editorial condemning the CIA for undermining Clinton's efforts to restore democracy in Haiti. It refers to a December 3 report on CBS, *60 Minutes*, which confirmed that Emmanuel Constant, the head of the terrorist forces in Haiti, FRAPH, during the military coup years – was a paid agent of the CIA. *Times* specialist on intelligence Tim Weiner mentioned that something similar had already been reported. In fact, it had been discovered and reported by freelance journalist Allan Nairn, who somehow has disappeared from the story, but now it is confirmed in the *60 Minutes* interview with Constant.

Let's look at some of the facts that have somehow escaped the *New York Times*, the *Washington Post*, CBS investigative reporters and others – apart from the fact that their intrepid investigative reporting had a little help from the unmentionable independent journalist who lacks all their resources but made all the discoveries. One fact is that Bush and Clinton did not oppose the military regime. Quite the contrary. The OAS (the Organization of American States) did call for an embargo after the coup, but within a few weeks, Bush announced that US manufacturers would be exempt from it. That was what the *New York Times* called "fine tuning" the embargo to help the Haitians. So trade with the coup regime continued, not quite at the usual level but not all that far below it. Under Clinton, that trade actually increased to not much below the normal level. Even training of Haitian military officers continued, according to Haitian church sources, right through the military coup period.

Well, there's something much more important than that. The crucial element of any embargo, as everyone knows, is oil. And everyone in Haiti could see that oil was continuing to flow, and, in fact, that the Mevs family and these other rich coup supporters were building new storage tanks. Where was it flowing from? Well, we now know the answer. It was flowing from the Texaco Corporation, which had been explicitly authorized by the Bush and the Clinton administrations to ship oil illegally to the military junta right through the period of the alleged embargo. To be precise, Texaco was informed that it was illegal for it to ship oil in violation of a presidential directive, but was also told that it could proceed without any concern for legal action or penalty. Texaco even went so far as presenting to the Treasury Department its plan to evade the embargo by legalistic trickery, claiming some other subsidiary was doing it and so on, and asking whether that would be legal. The Treasury Department replied, no, it wouldn't be legal, but go ahead anyway, nothing will happen if you do it.

Are those facts deeply hidden? No, they were the lead story on the AP wires on the day when every newsroom, everyone's eyes were focused on Haiti, the day before the US forces landed. The story reported that a leak from the Justice Department (which was later confirmed as accurate) stated that right through the Bush and Clinton administrations – we don't know exactly how late but well into the Clinton administration – the authorization of illegal shipment of oil continued. That was the day before the troops landed. Impossible to miss. In a free press, the headline the next day would have been: "There was no embargo. The United States conspired with the military to continue the terror and to block Aristide from coming in."

There was great outrage at this new exposure of CIA misdeeds. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) was interviewed on *60 Minutes*. He was particularly shocked that the CIA should undercut the US policy of opposing the military regime and restoring democracy. Clinton's ambassador, Lawrence Pezzullo, was amazed to learn that Constant's FRAPH organization was behind the demonstration that had caused Clinton to turn back the Harlan County, the ship that went in to Port-au-Prince harbor and then pulled out because of a demonstration, a crucial event in the whole affair. Pezzullo had insisted – in secret – that the *Harlan County* should not have been withdrawn, so the story now goes. And he was shocked that the CIA "scuttled the president's plan to restore Aristide to power" in this *Harlan County* incident. "Did the CIA distance itself from you?" asked *60 Minutes*. "No," Constant answered, eliciting more shock and amazement.

Like anybody who's interested in Haiti, I was watching the AP wires that Sunday and immediately picked up the story. I wrote an article the next day, but it was for the "alternative" press, so it was going to come out in six weeks. And I therefore wrote in the past tense; I described the story as if everybody knew it already. So if you look at the article that appeared, it says, as you read already in the papers six weeks ago, such and such. Well, that was kind of naive. It didn't occur to me that even this much could be suppressed by the free press, and I was wrong. It was suppressed. It's still very well hidden. Later, I did a database search on it just out of curiosity, and it's essentially out of history – meaning perfectly well-known, and even obliquely referred to here and there, but out of sight to everyone who does not know in advance what to look for – and in the national media, unmentioned.

What about the *Harlan County*? You know about this frightening demonstration that forced it to be returned, which we now discover with amazement was organized by Constant. Was that a surprise? Well, it wasn't a surprise to *New York Daily News* correspondent Juan Gonzalez. The day before the *Harlan County* incident, he learned about the plans at a Duvalierist rally also attended by US Embassy personnel, and he published the story on the very day the prearranged plans were executed, namely October 11, 1993. In fact, it wasn't a secret from any other journalist either, and it wasn't a secret from the CIA, and it wasn't a secret from the White House, and it surely wasn't a secret from Lawrence Pezzullo.

What about the President's "plan to restore Aristide"? Let's return to the question asked by the *60 Minutes* reporters: How did the CIA react after Emmanuel Constant "scuttled the president's plan to restore Aristide to power"? Big amazement – the CIA kept helping him. Is the CIA, then, a kind of a rogue elephant or something like that? Well, not as far as we know. What we know is that the White House scuttled the plans or rather never had them, and we know that the media have been suppressing the most obvious and crucial facts, which they cannot fail to know. Not only about the fake embargo and the economic program that's being rammed down Haitian throats, as the US proceeds to overturn the results of the democratic election, but even about the specific incident of the *Harlan County*. As for the CIA, it seems to have served as an agency of the White House, as it usually does, at least as far as information is available.

### Fabricating Security: The Next Stage in US-Israeli Cooperation

**by Graham Usher**

The new "security consensus" has accelerated a full-fledged US-Israel military axis which could not only set the terms of "peace" in the Middle East, but, very likely, create the conditions for its next war.

A few hours after an Islamic Jihad bomber killed 12 Israelis in a shopping mall in central Tel Aviv on March 4, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres phoned President Bill Clinton. He demanded urgent assistance, both military and diplomatic. Even by the partisan standards of its "sponsorship" of the Middle East peace process, the US response was dramatic.

A blitz of Islamist-inspired suicide attacks in Israel had precipitated the worst crisis of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process since its inception in 1993. In its ferocious pursuit of Palestinians affiliated to the Islamist movements of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the Israeli government of Shimon Peres reverted to the politics of "iron fist." This was the tag former Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Rabin, among others, gave to the mass punitive measures Israel routinely used in the occupied territories to crush the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The support is not new. The US had consistently backed Israeli opposition to Palestinian independence and stood virtually alone in the UN as Israel's unflagging ally. What is new in the current US posture is the explicit way Washington has exploited the crisis caused by the suicide attacks to further both its own and Israel's diplomatic and military ambitions in the region. One of the first concrete steps in this new approach came on March 5, when Clinton authorized the dispatch of eight bomb detection devices to Israel, at a cost of around $100 million, as well as a team of US "anti-terrorism experts" to assemble a "comprehensive package of training, technical assistance, and equipment." The transfer of the military hardware had been on the table for several months but was delayed over Israel-US wrangles about payment. After the suicide operations, the US wrangled no more; it decided to pay for the equipment itself. "Thank you, friend," said Israel's Minister for Internal Security, Moshe Shahal, when the first shipment landed at Ben Gurion airport on March 6.

But Peres' main need was political. The US sends around $3 billion in aid to Israel annually, much of it used to ensure Israel's "qualitative edge" as the dominant military power in the region. While senior Israeli police officers said they were "impressed by the openness and willingness of the US experts to help" them "in a wide range of anti-terror operations" after the suicide attacks, there was "little if anything the Americans could contribute" to Israel's existing counter-insurgency operations in the occupied territories.

What Peres was demanding from Clinton, rather, was for the US to take a galvanizing role in rallying international support for the moribund peace process and, thereby, garner legitimacy for a more belligerent Israeli posture in the region. Clinton clearly got the message. The upshot was the unprecedented show of international solidarity for Israel at the "summit of peacemakers" held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on March 13. Four days after the call from Peres, the US leader aired the idea of an international "anti-terrorism" conference. By March 9, the venue and composition of the summit had been fixed, thanks largely to the midwifery of the US's two staunchest allies in the Arab world, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's Prince Hassan. Invitations were sent out to 31 national leaders, 27 of whom eventually attended the summit, including an unprecedented 13 Arab state representatives. Libya, Iraq, Sudan, and Iran were conspicuously not invited. Syria and Lebanon declined to show on the grounds that their presence would "serve Israel's interests ... and legitimize its occupation of Arab lands." This prognosis turned out to be entirely accurate.

Both Israel and the US were impressed with the summit's symbolic value, since what it augured (in their eyes) was the beginnings of an "anti-terror" coalition in the region which, unlike the anti-Iraq alliance marshaled during the 1991 Gulf War, would place Israel at its very heart. The summit also revived Peres' flagging electoral prospects, which had been badly hurt by the suicide attacks. The sight of so many Arab leaders standing beside Israel in an apparent joint crusade against the scourge of "Islamic fundamentalism" could not but convince Israelis that "peace" had, indeed, fundamentally and massively altered the geopolitics of the region in Israel's favor.

But the US and Israel were less enamored of the summit's final communiqué. Emphasizing "peace" over "terror," its main clauses stressed the signatories' "full support" for the peace process and their "determination to promote security and stability" in the Middle East. The communiqué also noted the "special economic needs of the Palestinians" in the occupied territories, an oblique criticism of Israel's blockade. No mention was made of Israel's ongoing military occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, South Lebanon, and the Golan Heights. Most observers have cited this occupation as the primary cause of instability and insecurity in the region for the last 28 years.

But sources close to Peres say he and the Israeli delegation were angered by these genteel rebukes of his army's policies in the territories. The Israeli PM had lobbied hard to get the summit to adopt a practical embargo against those states in the region that he alleges sponsor Islamist violence. "Terrorism is not anonymous," said Peres at Sharm el-Sheikh. "It has a name. It has an address. It has bank accounts. It has an infrastructure. It has networks camouflaged as charity organizations. And it is spearheaded by a country – Iran." But with the exception of British Prime Minister John Major, who also berated Tehran, leaders at the summit drew back from singling out any one state. Rather they condemned "terror in all its forms, whatever its motivation and whoever is its perpetrator."

**Blaming Iran, Shelling Lebanon**

Israel's displeasure was mollified by the US president's "sympathy visit" to Jerusalem on March 14. In a show of partiality excessive even by Clinton's standards, the US leader not only ratified the "free" delivery of the $100 million "anti-terror" package, he also announced that the US would begin immediate negotiations with Israel to conclude a bilateral agreement upgrading military ties. This relationship does not yet amount to a full-fledged defense pact between the two countries, but that may emerge in the wake of Peres' visit to Washington in late April. Sources say the principal objective of Peres' trip was to pursue a joint declaration consecrating their close military relations with a formal strategic alliance, committing the US to defend Israel's "security" and enhance its "deterrent capability" against any threat.

Should this pact be realized, it will represent a major advance for Israeli and US ambitions in the region. It will formalize Israel's military hegemony in the absence of any coordinated Arab response to it, a disarray that is the intended fruit of the several bilateral peace processes Israel is currently engaged in with the Palestinians, Jordan, Egypt and, to a much lesser extent, Syria and Lebanon. According to Israeli journalist Zev Goren, US and Israeli "security experts" had wanted an official pact on "counter-terrorist" operations as long ago as 1986, endorsed by an international summit along the lines of Sharm el-Sheikh. Then US Secretary of State George Shultz shelved the idea on the grounds that, without a resolution of the Palestinian question, such a pact would only damage "US interests" in the Arab world. Today – in a political climate born of the Oslo process and a "security" environment predicated on "Islamic terrorism" – this anticipated Arab resistance is all but contained.

But the strategic aim of the pact is clear, and consistent with the blueprints drawn up in 1986: to quell, by a mix of diplomatic isolation and military force, any indigenous movement in the region that threatens Israeli domination and thereby US interests. In the 1980s, the sponsor of such recalcitrant nationalism was supposedly the Soviet Union. Today the US points to Iran. The difference – as well as the danger to the peoples of the region – is that a war against Iran is a conflict the US and Israel are certain they can win. "The US is convinced the time has come for our friends and allies in Asia and Europe to reconsider their stance towards Iran," said US Secretary of State Warren Christopher during Clinton's visit to Israel. "The evidence is clear that Iran continues to train, fund and provide political support for Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas – all sworn enemies of peace."

It was this US-led and -manufactured consensus that encouraged Israel, on April 11, to unleash its second full-scale military offensive against Lebanon in three years. Peres had many motives for launching Operation Grapes of Wrath, the least being to ensure the "security" of the residents who live near its northern border. Angered by the Lebanese Islamist Hezbollah movement's increasing success in hitting Israeli soldiers inside occupied South Lebanon, Israel's main aim with "Wrath" was to force the Lebanese and Syrian governments to deal with Iran and, through it, Hezbollah. This strategy paralleled the way Arafat, under similar instructions from Israel, has dealt with Hamas.

The operation failed. Despite killing more than 200 Lebanese civilians, displacing a further 400,000 and wrecking Lebanon's infrastructure, the US- and French-brokered "understanding" that ended the war on April 26 is no more than a return to the agreements reached after Israel's 1993 Operation Accountability. This earlier carnage left 100 Lebanese dead and displaced 300,000. But "Wrath" did not thwart the Israeli-US push to a full scale alliance. On May 1, Peres and Clinton signed the US-Israel Counter-Terrorism accord as a first step in "formalizing strategic cooperation." As for Israel's actions in Lebanon, these were less ignored by the US president than lauded. Concerning the Israeli army's killing of 102 Lebanese refugees sheltering in a UN base in South Lebanon, Clinton's only comment was that the massacre was the result of "Hezbollah's deliberate tactics in their positioning and firing" near the base.

**Hebrew for Apartheid**

In the long run – as the fighting in Lebanon again attests – a US-Israeli pact heightens the risk of war in the Middle East. In the short run, increased Israel-US security "cooperation" threatens to resolve the Palestinian question in ways amenable to Israel's territorial and military ambitions in the occupied territories. On this front, the impact of the new security consensus is already bearing fruit.

Israeli security sources say that most of the US's $100 million "anti-terror" package is being used to fund Israel's ongoing construction of a two-kilometer "security seam" that runs along the old 350-kilometer "green line" separating Israel from the West Bank. The seam is designed to physically segregate Palestinians from Israelis with fences, electronic surveillance fields, and augmented troop and helicopter patrols. From now on, West Bank Palestinians will be able to get to Israel only via one or another of 18 Israeli controlled terminals. This policy, says former head of the Israeli General Security Service (Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence service) Carmi Gillon, does not constitute "political separation" between Israel and the Palestinians, since that would preempt any final settlement on borders. But it does make a mockery of the various PLO/Israel economic protocols that underwrite the Oslo accords. The premise of this agreement was "open borders" and "joint tariffs" between the Israeli and Palestinian economies, expediting the free flow of goods and capital (if not of labor). But if the new seam is not a political border, says Palestine Authority (PA) Deputy Economics Minister Samir Hulieleh, then it must be a security border. As such, it means "the economic relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is no longer one of partnership, as it states in the Oslo agreement, but of subordination with Israel as the occupier." For Palestinians, the US-funded seam thus augurs not so much a sovereignty based on territorial exchange, as a new mode of military control built on demographic and ethnic segregation, or as the Israeli Peace bloc, Gush Shalom, expressed it, "the exact Hebrew translation of the South African term apartheid."

**Need Repression? Who You Gonna Call?**

Also alarming has been the US's unprecedented involvement – in the aftermath of the Hamas-sponsored suicide attacks – in the operations of the PA's 30,000-strong security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. On March 9, PLO leader Yassir Arafat and PA security officials met in Gaza with CIA security personnel, including the agency's Deputy Director George Tenet. Palestinian sources say Tenet demanded that the PA arrest Hamas activists. Arafat requested that the CIA "help" the PA police with the training of "counter-terrorism" techniques such as the deployment of sniffer dogs, explosive detectors and, of course, funds. It is unclear whether US expertise in this field has improved the PA's crackdown on Hamas and Islamic Jihad. What is documented is that since February 25, PA security forces have arrested more than 900 Palestinians, raided 30 Islamist institutions and taken over 60 "suspect" mosques in Gaza. According to both Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations, these actions have been taken arbitrarily, ungoverned by even a semblance of due process. Palestinian legal sources also report that suspected Islamist detainees in PA prisons are being held in "appalling conditions" and are routinely subject to torture. The US State Department has so far declined to comment on this dimension of Arafat's ruthless adoption of Israel's "internal security" agenda in the "self rule" areas.

**No Peace, Only Process**

US diplomatic and military interventions after the suicide operations have less to do with "peace" than with sustaining the Oslo "process." The US and Israel are firmly committed to this process which has enabled the US to begin to construct in the region an Israeli-led coalition more susceptible to its hegemony than at any time in the modern era. The threat of Islamist suicide attacks, then, is not simply the carnage they cause in the cities of Israel, but the impact such actions have in undermining Israeli public support for the peace process. More importantly, movements such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah articulate, via religious discourse, nationalist aspirations against Israeli, and US hegemony in the Middle East. It is because of these aspirations, rather than the "terrorism" they sometimes employ, that for Israel and the US, they and Islamism generally have become "the next threat." US political analyst Noam Chomsky explains why:

"The US always had a certain strategic perception of the region in which the main concern was control over oil; not so much oil but the profits from the oil which go back to the US and Britain and are not distributed to the people in the region. ... [It is a perception that has] been implemented over the years; there have been all sorts of tacit agreements of various kinds with the Saudi dictatorship and Israel.... There was a kind of three-way relationship. And I think the idea (with the Oslo process) is to try to bring that [relationship] to the surface because that is much more efficient. The general arrangement the US would like to implement is to ... subdue the Palestinian problem, which has been an irritant. It's been hard for the [Arab] dictatorships to bring the deal with Israel out into the open. As long as the Palestinian issue isn't settled, they face problems with their populations. But, if they can put that to one side and leave the job to the PLO, then they can move to bring to the surface the tacit relationships that have existed all along. That's the possibility. This is part of the reason why the US is so intent on making sure [Oslo] works. They have been trying to do this for the last fifty years."

### Are the Feds Sniffing Your Re-Mail?

**by John Dillon**

The rules of privacy are changing with electronic communications, the eagerness of government to pry into our personal communication, apparently, is not.

Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies are actively monitoring worldwide Internet traffic and are allegedly running "anonymous re-mailer" services designed to protect the privacy of electronic mail users. The startling claim that government snoops may be surreptitiously operating computer privacy protection systems used by private citizens was made earlier this year at a Harvard University Law School Symposium on the Global Information Infrastructure. The source was not some crazed computer hacker paranoid about government eavesdropping. Rather, the information was presented by two defense experts, Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Strassmann, now a professor at West Point and the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., along with William Marlow, a top official at Science Applications International Corp., a leading security contractor.

Anonymous re-mailer services are pretty much what the name implies. By stripping identifying source information from e-mail messages, they allow people to post electronic messages without traceable return address information. But Strassmann and Marlow said that the anonymous re-mailers, if used properly – and in tandem with encryption software – pose an unprecedented national security threat from "information terrorists." Intelligence services have set up their own re-mailers in order to collect data on potential spies, criminals, and terrorists, they said.

Following their Harvard talk, Strassmann and Marlow "explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous re-mailers in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic," said Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger, a lawyer from Austria who attended the conference. "Marlow said that the [US] government runs at least a dozen re-mailers and that the most popular re-mailers in France and Germany are run by respective agencies in those countries."

Mayer-Schoenberger was shocked by the defense experts' statement and tried to spread the news by sending an e-mail message to *Hotwired*, the online version of *Wired* magazine. Although the story did not make headlines, his note quickly became the e-mail message relayed 'round the world, triggering over 300 messages to Strassmann and Marlow. It was followed by the electronic version of spin control.

Strassmann quickly posted a denial. In an interview, he said the Austrian completely misunderstood what he and Marlow had said. "That was false," Strassmann said of Mayer-Schoenberger's message. "That was the person's interpretation of what we said. ... We did not specifically mention any government. What we said was that governments are so heavily involved in this [Internet issues] that it seems plausible that governments would use it in many ways." (Marlow did not return a call for comment.)

But Harvard Law School Professor Charles Nesson, who heard the original exchange at the Harvard conference, recalls the conversation as Mayer-Schoenberger described it. Mayer-Schoenberger also stands by his story. "I remember the conversation perfectly well," he e-mailed from Vienna. "They said a couple of additional things I'm sure they don't want people to remember. But the statement about the re-mailers is the one most people heard and I think is quite explosive news, isn't it?" "Marlow said that actually a fair percentage of re-mailers around the world are operated by intelligence services," Mayer-Schoenberger recalled in a subsequent interview. "Someone asked him: 'What about the US, is the same true here as well?' Marlow said: 'you bet.'" The notes for the Harvard symposium, posted on the World Wide Web, also lend credence to Mayer-Schoenberger's account. "The CIA already has anonymous re-mailers ... but to effectively control [the Internet] would require 7,000 to 10,000 around the world," the notes quote Marlow as saying.

**@Ease With Eavesdropping**

Prying into e-mail is probably as old as e-mail itself. The Internet is notoriously insecure; messages are kept on computers for months or years. If they aren't stored safely, they can be viewed by anyone who rummages through electronic archives – by searching through the hard drive, by using sophisticated eavesdropping techniques, or by hacking in via modem from a remote location. Once e-mail is obtained, legally or not, it can be enormously valuable. Lawyers are increasingly using archived e-mail as evidence in civil litigation. And it was Oliver North's e-mail (which he thought was deleted) that showed the depths of the Reagan administration's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.

Moreover, it's easier to tap e-mail messages than voice telephone traffic, according to the paper written by Strassmann and Marlow. "As e-mail traffic takes over an ever-increasing share of personal communications, inspection of e-mail traffic can yield more comprehensive evidence than just about any wire-tapping efforts," they wrote. "E-mail tapping is less expensive, more thorough and less forgiving than any other means for monitoring personal communications."

**@Risk**

Two kinds of anonymous re-mailers have evolved to protect the privacy of users. The first, and the less secure, are "two-way database re-mailers," which maintain a log linking anonymous identities to real user names. These services are more accurately called "pseudonymous" re-mailers since they assign a new name and address to the sender (usually a series of numbers or characters) and are the most vulnerable to security breaches, since the logs can be subpoenaed or stolen. The most popular "pseudonymous" re-mailer is a Finnish service at "anon.penet.fi".

"I believe that if you want protection against a governmental body, you would be foolish to use anon.penet.fi," said Jeffrey Schiller, manager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer network and an expert on e-mail and network security. Last year, in fact, authorities raided anon.penet.fi to look for the identity of a Church of Scientology dissident who had posted secret church papers on the Internet using the supposedly private service.

The second kind of re-mailers are "cypherpunk" services run by computer-savvy privacy advocates. Someone desiring anonymity detours the message through the re-mailer; a re-mailer program removes information identifying the "return address," and sends it on its way. Schiller says that a cypherpunk re-mailer in its simplest form is a program run on incoming e-mail that looks for messages containing a "request-re-mailing-to" header line. When the program sees such a line, it removes the information identifying the sender and "re-mails" the message. Some re-mailers replace the return address with something like "nobody@nowhere.org."

Further protection can be obtained by using free, publicly available encryption programs such as Pretty Good Privacy by chaining messages and re-mailers together. Sending the message from re-mailer to re-mailer – using encryption at each hop – builds up an onion skin arrangement of encrypted messages inside encrypted messages. Some re-mailers will vary the timing of the outgoing mail, sending the messages out in random sequence in order to thwart attempts to trace mail back by linking it to when it was sent.

**@Issue: The Right to Privacy**

Linking encrypted messages together can be tricky and time-consuming. So who would bother? A. Michael Froomkin, an assistant professor of law at the University of Miami and an expert on Internet legal issues, says anonymity allows people to practice political free speech without fear of retribution. Whistleblowers can identify corporate or government abuse while reducing their risk of detection. People with health problems that are embarrassing or might threaten their ability to get insurance can seek advice without concern that their names would be blasted electronically around the world. Abattered woman can use re-mailers to communicate with friends without her spouse finding her.

The Amnesty International human rights group has used anonymous re-mailers to protect information supplied by political dissidents, said Wayne Madsen, a computer security expert and co-author of a new edition of *The Puzzle Palace*, a book on the National Security Agency. "Amnesty International has people who use re-mailers because if an intelligence service in Turkey tracks down [political opponents] ... they take them out and shoot them," he said. "I would rather err on the side of those people. I would rather give the benefit of the doubt to human rights."

Strassmann and Marlow, on the other hand, see the threat to national security as an overriding concern. Their paper, "Risk-Free Access into the Global Information Infrastructure via Anonymous Re-mailers," presented at the Harvard conference, is a call to electronic arms. In it, they warn that re-mailers will be employed in financial fraud and used by "information terrorists" to spread stolen government secrets or to disrupt telecommunication, finance and power generation systems. Internet anonymity has rewritten the rules of modern warfare by making retaliation impossible, since the identity of the assailant is unknown, they said. "Since biblical times, crimes have been deterred by the prospects of punishment. For that, the criminal had to be apprehended. Yet information crimes have the unique characteristic that apprehension is impossible.... Information crimes can be committed easily without leaving any telltale evidence such as fingerprints, traces of poison or bullets," they wrote. As an example, they cite the Finnish re-mailer (anon.penet.fi), claiming that it is frequently used by the ex-KGB Russian criminal element. Asked for proof or further detail, Strassmann said: "That [paper] is as far in the public domain as you're going to get."

At the Harvard symposium, the pair provided additional allegations that anonymous re-mailers are used to commit crimes. "There was a crisis not too long ago with a large international bank. At the heart of the problem turned out to be anonymous re-mailers. There was a massive exchange around the world of the vulnerabilities of this bank's network," Marlow said.

But David Banisar, an analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) downplayed this kind of anecdote, saying that such allegations are always used by governments when they want to breach the privacy rights of citizens. "I think this information warfare stuff seems to be a way for the military trying to find new reasons for existence and for various opportunistic companies looking for ways to cash in. I'm really skeptical about a lot of it. The problem is nine-tenths hype and eight-tenths bad security practices," he said. "Already existing Internet security systems 'like encryption and firewalls could take care of the problem.' "

The public should not have to justify why it needs privacy, he said. "Why do you need window blinds? Privacy is one of those fundamental human rights that ties into other human rights such as freedom of expression, the right to associate with who you want, the right to speak your mind as you feel like it.... The question shouldn't be what do you have to fear, it should be 'Why are they listening in?' With a democratic government with constitutional limits to democratic power, they have to make the argument they need to listen in, not the other way around."

Froomkin, from the University of Miami, also questioned Strassmann and Mayer's conclusions. "First of all, the statistics about where the re-mailers are and who runs them are inaccurate. I can't find anybody to confirm them," he said. "I completely disagree with their assessment of facts and the conclusions they draw from them. ... Having said that, there's no question there are bad things you can do with anonymous re-mailers. There is potential for criminal behavior."

Banisar doubts that intelligence agencies are actually running re-mailers. "It would entail a fairly high profile that they tend to shy away from," he said. However, it is likely that agencies are "sniffing" – monitoring – traffic going to and from these sites, he said.

**@Work Sniffing the Net**

Not in doubt, however, is that the government is using the Internet to gather intelligence and is exploring the net's potential usefulness for covert operations. Charles Swett, a Department of Defense policy assistant for special operations and low-intensity conflict, produced a report last summer saying that by scanning computer message traffic, the government might see "early warnings of impending significant developments." Swett added that the "Internet could also be used offensively as an additional medium in psychological operations campaigns and to help achieve unconventional warfare objectives." The unclassified Swett paper was itself posted on the Internet by Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. The document focuses in part on Internet use by leftist political activists and devotes substantial space to the San Francisco-based Institute for Global Communications (IGC), which operates Peacenet and other networks used by activists. IGC shows, Swett writes, "the breadth of DoD-relevant information available on the Internet."

The National Security Agency is also actively "sniffing" key Internet sites that route electronic mail traffic, according to *Puzzle Palace* co-author Wayne Madsen. In an article in the British newsletter *Computer Fraud and Security Bulletin*, Madsen reported that sources within the government and private industry told him that the NSA is monitoring two key Internet routers – which direct electronic mail traffic – in Maryland and California. In an interview, Madsen said he was told that the NSA was "sniffing" for the "address of origin and the address of destination" of electronic mail. The NSA is also allegedly monitoring traffic passing through large Internet gateways by scanning "network access points" operated by regional and long-distance service providers. Madsen writes that the network access points allegedly under surveillance are at gateway sites in Pennsauken, N.J. (operated by Sprint), Chicago (operated by Ameritech and Bell Communications Research) and San Francisco (operated by Pacific Bell).

Madsen believes that NSA monitoring doesn't always stop at the US border, and if this is true, NSA is violating its charter, which limits the agency's spying to international activities. "People familiar with the monitoring claim that the program is one of the NSA's 'black projects,' but that it is pretty much an 'open secret' in the communications industry," he wrote.

Electronic communications open up opportunities to broaden democratic access to information and organizing. They also provide a means and an opportunity for governments to pry. But just as people have a right to send a letter through the post office without a return address, or even to drop it in a mail box in another city, so too, electronic rights advocates argue, they have the right to send an anonymous, untraceable electronic communication. And just as the post office can be used maliciously, or to commit or hide a crime, re-mailers can be used by cruel or criminal people to send hate mail or engage in "flame wars." And like the post office, the highways, and the telephone, the Internet could be used by spies or terrorists. Those abuses, however, do not justify curtailing the rights of the vast number of people who use privacy in perfectly legal ways.

Robert Ellis Smith, editor of the *Privacy Journal* newsletter, said government agencies seem obsessed with anonymous re-mailers. "They were set up by people with a very legitimate privacy issue,” he said. "Law enforcement has to keep up with the pace of technology as opposed to trying to infiltrate technology. Law enforcement seems to want to shut down or retard technology, and that's not realistic. Anonymous re-mailers are not a threat to national security."

### Risking the World: Nuclear Proliferation in Space

**by Karl Grossman**

Despite enormous danger, huge expense, and a clear alternative – solar power – the US government is pushing ahead with the deployment of nuclear technology in space. In October 1997, NASA plans to launch the Cassini probe to Saturn. Carrying 72.3 pounds of plutonium-238 fuel – the largest amount of plutonium ever used in space, the probe will sit atop a Lockheed Martin-built Titan IV rocket. This same kind of rocket has undergone a series of mishaps including a 1993 explosion in California soon after take-off which destroyed a $1 billion spy satellite system and sent its fragments falling into the Pacific Ocean.

*Space News*, the space industry trade newspaper, reported that "the high risk and cost of the Cassini mission to Saturn troubled NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin so much that he would cancel the program if it were not so important to planetary science." But it is not science alone that is driving the project or causing scientists, politicians, and the military to discount the risks. NASA Chief Scientist Frances Cordova acknowledges that the Titan IV "does not have a 100 percent success rate" and admits that using it for Cassini "is truly putting all your eggs in one basket your 18 instruments on one firecracker." She says, "We can't fail with that mission. It would be very, very, damaging for the agency."

To say nothing of the Earth and the life on it if something goes wrong. Plutonium has long been described by scientists as the most toxic substance known. It is "so toxic," says Dr. Helen Caldicott, founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility, "that less than one-millionth of a gram is a carcinogenic dose. One pound, if uniformly distributed, could hypothetically induce lung cancer in every person on Earth."

In addition to the specter of radioactivity spread by an accident on launch, another, potentially more lethal, scenario is causing concern. Because Cassini does not have the propulsion power to get directly from Earth to Saturn, NASA plans a "sling-shot maneuver" in which the probe will circle Venus twice and hurtle back at Earth. It will then buzz the Earth in August 1999 at 42,300 miles per hour just 312 miles above the surface. After whipping around Earth and using its gravity, Cassini would then have the velocity, says NASA, to reach Saturn. But during that Earth fly-by, if Cassini comes in too close, it could burn up in the 75-mile-high atmosphere and disperse plutonium across the planet.

Dr. Michio Kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the City University of New York, explains the catastrophic consequence of such a fly-by accident: "[I]f there is a small misfire [of Cassini's] rocket system, it will mean that [it] will penetrate into the Earth's atmosphere and the sheer friction will begin to wipe out the heat shield and it will, like a meteor, flame into the Earth's atmosphere .... This thing, coming into the Earth's atmosphere, will vaporize, release the payload and then particles of plutonium dioxide will begin to rain down on populated areas, if that is where the system is going to be hitting. [Pulverized plutonium dust] will rain down on people's hair, people's clothing, get into people's bodies. And because it is not water soluble, there is a very good chance that it could be inhaled and stay within the body causing cancer over a number of decades."

Indeed, NASA says in its *Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Cassini Mission*, that if an "inadvertent reentry occurred" during the fly-by, approximately five billion of the seven to eight billion people on Earth, "could receive 99 percent or more of the radiation exposure." As for the death toll, which NASA labels "health effects," the agency says that only 2,300 deaths "could occur over a 50-year period to this exposed population" and these "latent cancer fatalities" would likely be "statistically indistinguishable from normally occurring cancer fatalities among the world population."

However, after reviewing the data in the NASA report, Dr. Ernest Sternglass, professor emeritus of radiological physics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, concluded that NASA "underestimate[s] the cancer alone by about 2,000 to 4,000 times. Which means that not counting all the other causes of death – infant mortality, heart disease, immune deficiency diseases and all that – we're talking in the order of ten to twenty million extra deaths." The actual death toll, then, the physicist warned, may be as high as 30 to 40 million people.

Dr. Horst Poehler, for 22 years a scientist for NASA contractors at the Kennedy Space Center, commented on the Cassini mission: "Remember the old Hollywood movies when a mad scientist would risk the world to carry out his particular project? Well, those mad scientists have moved to NASA." Meanwhile the reactor into a higher orbit "to avoid any interference with current or planned astronomy missions." Astronomical interference could occur because Topaz II "would leave a trail of nuclear particles."

**In the Unlikely Event of a Water Landing**

In fact, the Topaz II reactor could leave more than that. According to a Sandia National Laboratories' safety report, if an accident occurs on launch and the reactor falls into the water, it could undergo a runaway nuclear reaction; if it falls from orbit it "may break up on reentry." Physicist Ned S. Rasor, who has worked on US space reactor development, argues that because Topaz II "will go critical – meaning an uncontrolled nuclear reaction if immersed in water; [it] is therefore unsafe for launch according to both US and Russian safety standards." Also, he points out that "no Topaz II system has been operated in space."

**Ignored Options**

Madder yet is that the deadly plutonium on Cassini is unnecessary. It will be used not for propulsion – that will be done by a chemically-fueled rocket – but to power three radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) to generate a modest 745 watts of electricity to run instruments – a task that could be accomplished with solar energy. In 1994, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced a "technology milestone" – development of new high-performance silicon solar cells with 25 percent efficiency. According to ESA, the cells have "the highest efficiency ever reached worldwide, ... [and] could profitably be used in deep space missions." "If given the money to do the work, within five years [ESA] could have solar cells ready to power a space mission to Saturn," said ESA physicist Carla Signorini.

But NASA, the Department of Energy's (DoE) national nuclear laboratories, and the corporations that have been involved in producing nuclear hardware for space mission insist on sticking with nuclear on Cassini.

**Russian Roulette**

While refusing to embrace European technology for Cassini, with the end of the Cold War, the US chose Russian-made reactors for other space activities. The Air Force is currently ground-testing six Russian Topaz II nuclear reactors – originally purchased for use in the Strategic Defense Initiative or Star Wars – at its Phillips Laboratory in New Mexico. A flight test scheduled for December 1995 was postponed after complaints from US astronomers.

The members of the governing council of the American Astronomical Society "emphasized they were not opposing the mission or the use of nuclear reactors in space. Instead, they wanted to put pressure on" the government to use a "more powerful rocket" that would put nuclear technology into a higher orbit "to avoid any interference with current or planned astronomy missions." Astronomical interference could occur because Topaz II "would leave a trail of nuclear particles."

**Clinton Carries On**

Despite some expectations that the Clinton administration would put an end to the Reagan/Bush administrations' vision of Star Wars, it has continued to budget $3 billion annually for the endeavor. And a 1993 White House policy statement asserted that "space nuclear power and propulsion systems can contribute to scientific, commercial and national security space missions."

Later that year, the Department of Energy placed a notice in the *Federal Register* announcing that it sought to "fund research and development studies directed at ... identifying innovative approaches using nuclear reactor power and propulsion systems for potential future NASA, DOD, and commercial space activities." Not to be outdone, the Republican congressional majority under Newt Gingrich has been seeking a major Star Wars revival as promised in its "Contract With America." And former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole is demanding a revived "missile defense." In fact, since the end of the Cold War, the biggest change in the program has been in name: from the Strategic Defense Initiative to Ballistic Missile Defense.

The commitment to nuclearize space continues. Last year, Terry Lash, director of the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy, told the subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations that the "purpose" of his agency's "Space and Defense Power Systems program is to produce radioisotope power systems for US civilian space missions and national security terrestrial missions. Radioisotope power systems have been used for three decades and are proven, reliable, and maintenance-free power supplies that are capable of producing up to several kilowatts of electricity for tens of years. ... Radioisotope power systems are the cornerstone of the Nation's space nuclear energy program. ... In addition, the program provides support for terrestrial Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator applications for national security missions."

Nuclear technology is being incorporated into a wide variety of scientific and military space projects. Among them:

*   Sandia National Laboratories is embarking on a project to develop nuclear-powered satellites to transmit "high-definition, multichannel television" signals. It is intended to be a pathway to make the US a global telecommunications superpower, and would pair controversial space nuclear power with entertainment and communications on demand. Sandia's Roger X. Leonard, who unveiled the project at the 11th Annual Symposium on Space Nuclear Power and Propulsion in Albuquerque in 1994, said a "constellation of five such satellites, powered by high-energy reactors and strategically located in orbit around the Earth" could be in place by 2000. He dismissed concerns about using nuclear technology in space, exclaiming: "Look, space already is highly radioactive."
*   NASA is planning to launch a pair of plutonium-fueled space probes for a mission to Pluto in 1999.
*   NASA intends to have a plutonium-powered heating system on board the Mars Pathfinder which is scheduled for launch this December.
*   The US Air Force has been studying the use of nuclear reactors to "provide power and propulsion for military satellites." The "bi-modal" nuclear spacecraft would serve both as a "propulsion system and for electric power."
*   What *Space News* described as "an aerospace industry alliance" of seven companies, including Lockheed Martin and a Russian firm, has come up with a scheme to build a "high-powered" nuclear communications satellite.

**Not Over My Planet**

As the number and variety of programs increases, so does the potential for disaster. A worldwide coalition is challenging the use of nuclear power in space: The Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space was formed at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in 1992. Bruce Gagnon, one of the coalition's co-coordinators, declared: "Our concern is that the United States military and major weapons corporations view space as a new market, ultimately to profit from. They are using taxpayers' dollars to put a new round of the arms race in space. At the same time the nuclear power industry views space as its new market, a place where they can put plutonium and other radioactive sources, whether it's military missions or civilian inter-planetary missions.... What is needed now is for the American public to speak out."

Local groups around the world have. On the island of Kauai in Hawaii, for example, a series of test launches – now dubbed "Stars" launches – has been met with protests that have included civil disobedience resulting in arrests. Polaris missiles are being fired along a range that ends at the Kwajalein Atoll 2,200 miles to the west. Ancient Hawaiian burial grounds and important natural habitats on the island are in the "evacuation zone" set up by the military in case launches go bad. Suzanne Marinelli of the Sierra Club of Hawaii, one of those arrested in the protests, warns that an accident on launch could be "catastrophic, raining burning debris and hazardous waste." "We are enslaving our own people for the empowerment of particular individuals and programs, and it's a sin."

Meanwhile, the Global Network and others are digging in and insisting that the policy-making process be "opened up" to re-examine basic fundamental assumptions," declared Network co-coordinator Bill Sulzman. One of those core assumptions – that the development of US nuclear superiority in technology and weaponry is essential to national security – began with the Manhattan Project. That crash program to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan also created the base for spreading nuclear power to space. But, declared Sulzman, "The Manhattan Project needed to end [with] World War II. We don't need it still alive and controlling our national security apparatus."

Instead, with an impressive half-life of its own, the nuclear establishment easily survived the end of the war. The military men and scientists, the government officials and corporate contractors of the Manhattan Project sought to do more with nuclear technology in order to perpetuate the vast enterprise that had been created – to hold their jobs and contracts. More nuclear weapons could be built, and tens of thousands were. But what else could be done to keep the new nuclear establishment going?

In 1946, the Manhattan Project became the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) which "hastened to build a number of new atomic toys," according to *Nukespeak*. "The commission had an early interest in nuclear-powered planes, and the Nuclear Energy Propulsion for Aircraft project was begun in 1948. Atomic-powered airplanes would make long-distance bombing easier, since the planes were expected to be able to circle the globe without refueling." More than $1 billion (in 1950s dollars) was spent on this scheme before it was canceled by the Kennedy administration in 1961. Washington was concerned about an atomic plane crashing and – as then Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara told Congress – because nuclear aircraft would "expel some small fraction of radioactive fission products into the atmosphere, creating an important public relations problem if not an actual physical hazard."

**Snap, Crackle, Boom**

An early program to develop nuclear rockets began in the 1950s at Los Alamos, *Nukespeak* relates, "with the development of the Kiwi reactors, inauspiciously named after the flightless New Zealand bird." In fact, even after the expenditure of $2 billion for such programs as NERVA, and Projects Pluto, Rover, and Poodle, no nuclear rocket ever got off the ground. There were government concerns about a nuclear rocket crashing. And there were no military orders then for nuclear rockets.

A 1961 editorial in a special edition of the trade magazine *Nucleonics* heralded "The Nuclear Space Age – the joining in inevitable matrimony of two of contemporary man's most exciting frontiers, nuclear energy and outer space." The nuclear rocket, it continued, "gives this country its only chance to catch up with – indeed to surpass – the USSR." However, neither the Air Force nor Navy had requested nuclear rockets, a situation which *Nucleonics* deplored because there would be an "easier flow of development dollars" if there was "a clear-cut military requirement."

Meanwhile, starting in 1961, General Electric's RTGs were put into use for space satellites – until a 1964 accident in which a SNAP-9A (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) fell to earth, burning up in the atmosphere. According to a 1989 report by European nuclear agencies, the satellite's 2.1 pounds of plutonium-238 "vaporized" and "dispersed widely." After conducting a worldwide sampling, scientists found "SNAP-9A debris to be present at all continents and all latitudes." Dr. John Gofman, professor emeritus of medical physics at the University of California at Berkeley, an M.D. and Ph.D. and a co-discoverer of isotopes of plutonium and uranium as a member of the Manhattan Project, has long attributed an increased rate of lung cancer to the SNAP-9A incident.

Although the SNAP-9A accident spurred NASA to develop and use solar photovoltaic technology for the satellites, the agency continued to employ nuclear power for space probes and also as a power source on the Apollo moon missions. Indeed, noticeably absent from the blockbuster 1995 movie *Apollo 13* was mention of a nuclear device aboard the mission – a SNAP-27 carrying 8.3 pounds of plutonium.

While omitted from the film, concern over the SNAP-27 breaking up and spreading plutonium as it came down along with the astronauts took up three pages in the book on which *Apollo 13* was based. In *Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13*, mission commander Jim Lovell and his co-author write: "On the surface of the moon, the tiny generator posed no danger to anybody. But what, some people worried – would happen if the little rod of nuclear fuel never made it to the moon?... Now [SNAP-27] was on its way home, heading for just the fiery reentry the doomsayers had feared."

As *Apollo 13* struggled to regain control, NASA jettisoned the plutonium-laden reactor. According to a 1980 NASA document, SNAP-27 "was successfully targeted to deposit intact in the Tonga Trench in the South Pacific [off New Zealand], where it is effectively isolated from man's environment."

**Risky Business**

There have been three accidents out of the 24 known US space missions involving nuclear power. The Soviet failure rate is even higher: six of their 39 nuclear missions failed. In 1978, a Cosmos 954 satellite disintegrated as it crashed to Earth over northwest Canada leaving a 124,000-square kilometer swath of nuclear debris.

The most recent US missions involving RTGs lofted many times the plutonium of the earlier flights. The Galileo, launched in 1989, carried 49.25 pounds of plutonium fuel on a mission to Jupiter; the 1990 Ulysses took 25 pounds on its orbit around the sun. Those missions had been postponed after the January 28, 1986 Challenger explosion. The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice and other parties brought lawsuits to block the nuclear launches and organized protests at the Kennedy Space Center. Even so, "[t]he American people don't realize that on the very next mission after the Challenger accident, the Ulysses spacecraft, was supposed to be sent into outer space with 25 pounds of plutonium," notes Dr. Kaku. "Now imagine that very same Challenger with the Ulysses spacecraft exploding on our television screens." Had that rocket blown up instead of the Challenger, far more people than seven astronauts could have perished.

Despite the enormous danger, NASA is committed to nuclear technology in space. And despite advances in solar power, it continues to insist – in fact, its witnesses swore in court – that Galileo could only be completed with plutonium RTGs. Yet, two weeks after the 1989 launch, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request I had filed two years earlier with NASA and DoE, I received reports from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory acknowledging that solar energy could substitute for nuclear power. "Based on the current study, it appears that a Galileo Jupiter orbiting mission could be performed with a concentrated photovoltaic solar array power source without changing the mission sequence or impacting science objectives," one report began. A year later when Ulysses was launched, NASA actually admitted in its pre-launch *Final Environmental Impact Statement* that solar could substitute for nuclear power but would require a "redesign."

**Nuclear Madness**

Driving this seemingly mad policy is a combination of corporate, bureaucratic, and military interests. By the early 1980s, with the advent of the Reagan Star Wars program, the military was no longer resisting ordering nuclear rockets, as *Nucleonics* had complained about two decades earlier. And NASA, with the end of its Apollo man-on-the-moon flights and fearful of decreased funding, jumped into bed with the Pentagon: The shuttle was developed in large part to fulfill military missions. NASA, DOD and DoE in 1991 set up a joint Office for Nuclear Propulsion.

Also, NASA and DoE moved to limit the US government's financial exposure in the event of the inevitable: further accidents involving nuclear space hardware. In 1991, the agencies signed a "Space Nuclear Power Agreement" restricting death or damage benefits from an accident caused by a US space nuclear device to the limits of the Price-Anderson Act. That law, passed in 1957, supposedly on a temporary basis, now caps US payouts at $7.3 billion and assigns a mere $100 million for all damage to other countries and their people.

"Nuclear energy in outer space," says Dr. Kaku, is the linchpin of the US space program and the key to the militarization of space. "We have nuclear weapons on the land. We have nuclear weapons in the ocean. We have nuclear weapons in the air." And now, Kaku warns: "What we are headed for is a nuclear-propelled rocket with nuclear-propelled lasers in outer space. That's what the military and that's what NASA would really like to do. With a Timberwind rocket, a booster rocket to hoist large payloads in outer space, we are talking about the ultimate goal of all of this madness. First, we have small little reactors called the SNAP reactors. Then, we have the RTGs and Galileo and Cassini. Then we have the big Timberwind projects. And ultimately what they would like to do is have nuclear-powered battle stations in outer space. That's what all of this is leading up to."

Kaku went on to say that it is up to environmentalists, activists, and concerned citizens, "to stop this now before it reaches the point of militarization of outer space." "We have to stop these Cassinis. We have to stop these Ulysses now before we have full-blown Timberwinds, before we have Alpha lasers, before we have genuine nuclear booster rockets and nuclear power plants in outer space. That's why we have to send a signal to Congress. We have to send a signal to NASA, and a signal to the United States Pentagon that we're not going to tolerate the nuclearization of outer space, and it stops now."

The Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space intends through a variety of planned actions – from organizing protests to circulating petitions to political activities – to press on sending that signal, to "continue the resistance," says Gagnon, "to this sheer and utter madness."

Karl Grossman, professor of journalism at the State University of New York/College at Old Westbury, has written extensively on nuclear issues. He is the author of *Power Crazy* (New York: Grove Press, 1986) and *Cover Up: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Nuclear Power* (Sag Harbor, N.Y.: Permanent Press, 1980). He wrote and narrated the 1995 TV documentary: *Nukes In Space: The Nuclearization and Weaponization of the Heavens*.

### The FAIR Reader: An Extra! Review of Press and Politics in the '90s

**edited by Jim Naureckas and Janine Jackson**

*FAIR*, Freedom and Accuracy in Reporting, has been around for a decade now, and its work is invaluable. Against a steady drumbeat of complaints about "liberal media bias," *FAIR* is there with a reality check. These media watchdogs work from the premise that the corporate-owned mass media just might have an agenda other than "objective" journalism. *FAIR* has consistently exposed the media-corporate connections and their consequences. With close content analysis and a savvy political understanding, the folks at *FAIR* have established themselves as formidable media critics.

And they have become a force to be reckoned with. Among recent coups, they punctured talk radio's leading gasbag with *Rush Limbaugh's Reign of Error*, in which they debunked claim after ludicrous claim. The group's magazine, *Extra!*, the source of the articles reprinted in this book, does similar work on a monthly basis. It offers uniformly well-written and cutting analyses of the media, dissecting, for example, how the *New York Times*' corporate ideology skewed its NAFTA coverage or how *Nightline* stacks its guest lists. What better way to celebrate the media watch group's success than an anthology of some of its most incisive, penetrating work?

The articles were written as commentary on contemporary events and have not been substantially revised. Still, they do not seem dated; the issues they address and the biases they report, for the most part, still bedevil us. Jim Naureckas' "Media on the March: Journalism in the Gulf," for instance, should be required reading in every journalism school and newsroom in the country. He provides a textbook analysis of the media dynamics that made Gulf War reporting a low point in US journalism. If the coverage of Israel's two-week war on Lebanon or the recent Cuban small plane shootdown is any indication, when it comes to "our boys" fighting and dying, the US mass media fall in behind the official line like so many good soldiers.

But the supine performance of the media at war is relatively easy to spot; structural biases that influence coverage of social and economic issues are more subtle. *Extra!* deserves congratulations for its outstanding efforts to document these distortions as well. Along the way, it offers insightful, devastating, even morbidly humorous critiques of the media stance on the issues of the day. From welfare to warfare, crime to health care, *The FAIR Reader* is essential reading.

### Holy Terror: Armageddon in Tokyo

**by D.W. Brackett**

D.W. Brackett is a journalist and former US Air Force intelligence officer specializing in counterterrorism, clandestine intelligence collection, and intelligence analysis, with decades of experience in East Asia. He brings this baggage with him in this first English-language account of the Japanese cult Aum Shinri Kyo and its deadly gas attack on the Tokyo subway system.

By training and apparent predisposition, Brackett is inclined to hype "the terrorist threat." In Aum and its charismatic leader, Shoko Asahara, he certainly has the right vehicle. The sect took to murdering its foes early on and was frenetically establishing a world-wide arms acquisition network so it could do so on a massive scale. As Brackett details, only a few blunders kept it from killing hundreds, possibly thousands, in the subway gassing, instead of the final toll of 12 killed and 5,000 injured.

Still, as a terrorist organization, Aum is something of a fluke, a group thrown up from the ferment of post-war Japanese religious dissidence. It has no connections with international terrorist networks, at least that Brackett can nail down, although its global reach stretched to cash-starved Russian scientists and eager-to-deal US chemical and high tech companies. What is really chilling in Brackett's account, and what is perhaps the most frightening lesson in the Aum adventure, is that with enough money, anyone can buy just about any weapon on earth.

But because of the sect's unique provenance, not much else about it provides grist for Brackett's anti-terrorist mill. The only concrete recommendation Brackett can make is for Japan to tighten its laws governing religious freedom. Brackett documents official Japanese reluctance to go after Aum Shinri Kyo in spite of early signs that trouble was brewing, and argues that the non-response stemmed from fear of interfering in the constitutionally-protected religious sphere. He fails to note, however, that this protection is a reaction to bouts of religious persecution in Japan's past. Without a change in Japan's laws and official culture, he says, cult-based terror could happen again. Brackett's fears are probably overstated, but in making his case, he provides an engrossing narrative portrait of the sect's trajectory, inner workings, and messianic impulses, as well as a close, critical analysis of Japanese (and other) police and intelligence responses to Aum. Its mostly misplaced security concerns and sensational marketing strategy aside (the title speaks for itself and the cover features an eerie portrait of a bearded, glowering Asahara superimposed over a ghostly army of gas-masked police), *Holy Terror* is an entertaining, well-informed account of one of the world's most bizarre acts of terror.

### East Timor: Genocide in Paradise

**by Matthew Jardine**

Odonion Press is to be commended for its "The Real Story" series, to which this book belongs. "The Real Story" books are concise, well-written, highly informative introductions to contemporary issues ranging from a JFK assassination primer to a guide to anti-environmental organizations; from a look at Burma to a set of Noam Chomsky's political analyses. Matthew Jardine's *East Timor* is a welcome addition.

One of the most underreported stories of the last 20 years, the Indonesian occupation and annexation of East Timor remains an ugly stain on the world stage. Jardine tells the story of Indonesian atrocity and US, Australian, and other Western complicity with verve and passion, yet without stepping over the line that separates reporting from propagandizing. He also relates the story of Timorese resistance to occupation, a tale of steadfastness and ingenuity in the face of one of the worst genocides in proportion to population since World War II. Since the invasion, some 200,000 of East Timor's 700,000 people have been killed or died as the result of occupation. But, Jardine notes, the resistance continues, and he explains its intricacies and prospects.

The book is also graced with an introduction by Noam Chomsky, who dissects the role of Western governments and mass media in hiding the story of East Timor from the world. Chomsky lifts the "veils of deceit" that obscure the cozy, mutually beneficial relationship between Indonesia's Gen. Suharto and the foreign services, lenders, and natural resource companies of the West.

### Bolivia and Coca: A Study in Dependency / Political Economy and Illegal Drugs in Colombia / Mexico's "War" on Drugs: Causes and Consequences / Unintended Consequences: Illegal Drugs and Drug Policies in Nine Countries / Marijuana in the "Third World:" Appalachia, USA

**by James Painter / Francisco E. Thoumi / Maria Celia Toro / Lamond Tullis / Richard R. Clayton**

The first half of a projected ten-volume series (the remaining titles will cover Peru, Thailand, Burma, Laos, and Pakistan), this set of studies should become standard references on the global drug trade and its consequences. Undertaken by an international team of social scientists and economists, they present a scathing indictment of the current international drug control regime.

Not that the authors would say so out loud. Their conclusions are carefully drawn, heavily qualified, and couched in academic equivocation, but the writers cannot flee from their own data. The data uniformly show that international drug control efforts are at best ineffective; at worst, terribly destructive of entire countries and cultures. From Colombia and Mexico, where international drug prohibition efforts have created monsters in the form of wealthy, violent trafficking enterprises – the misnamed cartels – to the US, where massive marijuana eradication programs breed only corruption, disdain for the law, and an unending flow of non-violent prisoners, these volumes describe a drug control regime that can only be qualified as a dreadful failure. They also uniformly show that the US is (and always has been) the motive force behind the international "War on Drugs." The studies of Colombia, Bolivia, and Mexico all elucidate how unstinting pressure from the US has persuaded policy-makers in all three countries to bow before the Colossus of the North, often with results inimical to their own societies and polities. In all three, the US-organized drug war has created criminal enterprises that have the capacity and the will to threaten the integrity of the state.

Unfortunately, none of the volumes adequately addresses how the "War on Drugs" succeeds; how it advances global US police, military, and intelligence objectives, a role increasingly important since the fall of the Soviet bloc removed that pretext for the projection of US power. This narrow focus on international drug prohibition becomes a blinder that prevents these scholars from undertaking a broader analysis of the functions served by a "War on Drugs."

Except for the overview volume by project leader Lamond Tullis, the studies are full of statistical data from every available source, and for this alone they merit careful study. But the authors also take extremely careful looks at the data's validity and reliability – an essential exercise in a field where the numbers are, at best, educated guesses. For the general reader, however, Tullis' *Unintended Consequences*, which compares and summarizes the entire series, will probably suffice. Interestingly, it is Tullis who comes closest to uttering the policy that dare not speak its name: legalization. Through his thoughtful and wide-ranging discussion of "harm reduction" as an organizing principle for a new drug control regime, Tullis bravely hints that even legalization would be better than the status quo.

### OKBOMB!: Conspiracy and Cover-up

**by Jim Keith**

Jim Keith has long prowled the uncanny terrain of contemporary conspiracy theory. In fact, the author of *The Gemstone File* and *Black Helicopters Over America* is one of the most engaging and smartest writers in this strange genre. Smart enough that when he describes how Timothy McVeigh may be controlled by an electronic implant, he is careful to assure the reader that this is just speculation.

Indeed. But Keith is prepared to run with any rumor, any theory, no matter how ludicrous. Advertised as "the truth behind the Oklahoma City bombing," what *OKBOMB!* really offers is a compendium of every known conspiracy theory about the bombing. In so doing, Keith seems to harken back to that granddaddy of conspirators, Hassan Al-Sabah, the "Old Man of the Mountain" and father of the assassins, who supposedly said, "Nothing is true; all is permitted." For Keith, too, anything goes: The Arabs did it. (Or was it the Iranians? He seems terminally confused about the difference between Iraq and Iran.) The lunatic right did it. The government did it. Or the Iranians/Iraqis, the lunatic right, and the government did it together. Or it was the Japanese, who, according to one Deborah Von Trapp, did it in revenge for the Tokyo subway gassing, which, she says, the CIA engineered.

Many of Keith's sources do not exactly inspire confidence. Beside Von Trapp, the roster includes inveterate conspiracy scammer Michael Riconisciuto, the Liberty Lobby's *Spotlight*, Lyndon LaRouche's *New Federalist*, a variety of Christian Patriot publications, professional crank Sherman Skolnick, and space alien-CIA conspiracy writer and Linda Thompson associate William Cooper.

The official line, though, always deserves scrutiny, and Keith does cite material from more reliable sources, including the mainstream press, which under close analysis yields discrepancies and raise nagging questions about the bombing: Whatever happened to John Doe #2? Did McVeigh and Nichols have militia co-conspirators? Could a single fertilizer bomb really have wreaked such devastation? And how does a VIN number show up on an axle? In the hands of Keith's primary sources, however, such seeds of doubt grow into mighty stands of twisted, tangled logic supported only by fevered speculation.
